    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Transformations**:\n   - The Fourier transform \\( F(k) \\) of \\( f(x) \\) is given by \\( F(k) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-ikx} f(x) dx \\).\n   - The derivative operator \\( D \\) applied to \\( f(x) \\) gives \\( Df(x) = f'(x) \\).\n\n2. **Applying the Derivative Operator**:\n   - When we apply the derivative operator \\( D \\) to \\( f(x) \\), we get \\( Df(x) = f'(x) \\).\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( f'(x) \\) is \\( i k F(k) \\). This can be derived from the property of the Fourier transform that states \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{f'(x)\\} = ikF(k) \\).\n\n3. **Applying the Transformation \\( g(x) = x^2 f(x) \\)**:\n   - Now, we apply \\( g(x) = x^2 f(x) \\) to the result of the derivative.\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( x^2 f(x) \\) involves the convolution theorem and properties of Fourier transforms. Specifically, for \\( h(x) = x^2 f(x) \\), its Fourier transform \\( H(k) \\) can be expressed using the fact that \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{x^2 f(x)\\} = -\\frac{d^2}{dk^2} F(k) \\).\n\n4. **Combining the Transformations**:\n   - First, we have \\( Df(x) = f'(x) \\), and its Fourier transform is \\( i k F(k) \\).\n   - Then, applying \\( g(x) = x^2 \\) to \\( f'(x) \\), we get \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{x^2 f'(x)\\} = -\\frac{d^2}{dk^2} (i k F(k)) \\).\n   - Simplifying, \\( -\\frac{d^2}{dk^2} (i k F(k)) = -i \\frac{d^2}{dk^2} (k F(k)) \\).\n\n5. **Final Transformed Function \\( G(k) \\)**:\n   - The expression \\( -i \\frac{d^2}{dk^2} (k F(k)) \\) shows that the final transformed function \\( G(k) \\) is not simply a product of corresponding transforms. It involves differentiation and multiplication with \\( k \\).\n\nTherefore, the final transformed function \\( G(k) \\) is not a straightforward product of corresponding transforms due to the additional \\( x^2 \\) term and the resulting differentiation.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
