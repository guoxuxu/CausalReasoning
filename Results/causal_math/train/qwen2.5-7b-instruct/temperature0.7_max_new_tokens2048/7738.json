Therefore, the actual signal being transformed is \\( x(t)h(t) = x(t)e^{at} \\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform of Modulated Signal**:\n   - The Fourier transform of the modulated signal \\( x(t)e^{at} \\) can be expressed using the frequency shift property of the Fourier transform. According to this property, if \\( y(t) = x(t)e^{j\\omega_0 t} \\), then \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{y(t)\\} = X(\\omega - \\omega_0) \\), where \\( X(\\omega) \\) is the Fourier transform of \\( x(t) \\).\n   - In our case, since \\( e^{at} \\) can be written as \\( e^{j\\omega t} \\) with \\( \\omega = a \\), the Fourier transform of \\( x(t)e^{at} \\) would be \\( Z(\\omega - a) \\), where \\( Z(\\omega) \\) is the Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\).\n\n3. **Observing \\( z'(\\omega) \\)**:\n   - We observe \\( z'(\\omega) \\), which is the Fourier transform of the modulated signal. This means \\( z'(\\omega) = Z(\\omega - a) \\).\n\n4. **Recovering \\( x(t) \\)**:\n   - To recover \\( x(t) \\), we need to reverse the effect of the modulation. Given \\( z'(\\omega) = Z(\\omega - a) \\), we need to find \\( Z(\\omega) \\) first.\n   - Since \\( Z(\\omega) = z'(\\omega + a) \\), we have recovered the Fourier transform of the original signal \\( x(t) \\).\n   - However, recovering \\( x(t) \\) from \\( Z(\\omega) \\) requires an inverse Fourier transform, i.e., \\( x(t) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{Z(\\omega)\\} \\).\n\n5. **Dependency on Modulation**:\n   - The key point here is that the recovery of \\( x(t) \\) directly from \\( z'(\\omega) \\) depends on knowing the modulation factor \\( e^{at} \\).
