    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the System**: We have a system of linear differential equations described by \\(\\dot{x} = Mx\\), where \\(M\\) is a constant coefficient matrix. This implies that the system evolves linearly with time according to the matrix \\(M\\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Application**: The Fourier transform \\(F(x(t))\\) is applied to the function \\(x(t)\\). The Fourier transform converts a time-domain signal into its frequency-domain representation.\n\n3. **Effect of Fourier Transform**: When we apply the Fourier transform to \\(x(t)\\), we get:\n   \\[\n   F(x(t)) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(t) e^{-iwt} dt\n   \\]\n   This transforms the time-domain signal \\(x(t)\\) into a frequency-domain representation.\n\n4. **Differential Equation in Frequency Domain**: To understand how the Fourier transform affects the system, let's consider the differential equation in the frequency domain.

    "To determine if the spectrum \\( F(x(t)) \\) at frequency \\( w \\) solely depends on the matrix \\( M \\) when applying the Fourier transform to a function \\( x(t) \\) governed by \\( \\dot{x} = Mx \\), let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **System Dynamics**: The system is described by the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Mx \\). This implies that the solution \\( x(t) \\) can be written as \\( x(t) = e^{Mt}x(0) \\), where \\( x(0) \\) is the initial condition.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Application**: Applying the Fourier transform to \\( x(t) \\) gives:\n   \\[\n   F(x(t)) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty x(t) e^{-iwt} dt\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( x(t) = e^{Mt}x(0) \\) into the Fourier transform, we get:\n   \\[\n   F(x(t)) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{Mt}x(0) e^{-iwt} dt = x(0) \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{(M-iw)t} dt\n   \\]\n\n3. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**: The eigenvalues of the matrix \\( M \\) play a crucial role here. Let's denote the eigenvalues of \\( M \\) by \\( \\lambda_i \\) and the corresponding eigenvectors by \\( v_i \\). Any vector \\( x(0) \\) can be expressed as a linear combination of these eigenvectors:\n   \\[\n   x(0) = \\sum c_i v_i\n   \\]\n   Thus, the solution \\( x(t) \\) can be written in terms of its eigenvectors and eigenvalues:\n   \\[\n   x(t) = \\sum c_i e^{\\lambda_i t} v_i\n   \\]\n\n4. **Fourier Transform of Each Component**: Applying the Fourier transform to each component \\( e^{\\lambda_i t} v_i \\):\n   \\[\n   F(e^{\\lambda_i t} v_i) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{\\lambda_i t} v_i e^{-iwt} dt = v_i \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{(\\lambda_i - iw)t} dt\n   \\]\n   The integral converges only if \\( \\text{Re}(\\lambda_i - iw) < 0 \\), which simplifies to \\( \\text{Re}(\\lambda_i) < w \\).\n\n5. **Spectrum Dependence**: The spectrum \\( F(x(t)) \\) at frequency \\( w \\) depends on the eigenvalues \\( \\lambda_i \\) of the matrix \\( M \\) and the initial conditions \\( x(0) \\). Specifically, it depends on how the initial conditions project onto the eigenvectors associated with eigenvalues having real parts less than \\( w \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: While the form of the Fourier transform \\( F(x(t)) \\) does involve the matrix \\( M \\) through its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, the specific value of the spectrum at a given frequency \\( w \\) also depends on the initial conditions \\( x(0) \\). Therefore, the spectrum \\( F(x(t)) \\) at frequency \\( w \\) does not solely depend on the matrix \\( M \\); it also depends on the initial conditions.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "To determine whether the spectrum \\( F(x(t)) \\) at frequency \\( w \\) solely depends on the matrix \\( M \\), let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the System Dynamics**: The system is described by the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Mx \\). This implies that the system is linear and homogeneous, with \\( M \\) being the constant coefficient matrix.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Application**: Applying the Fourier transform to both sides of the differential equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   F(\\dot{x}(t)) = F(Mx(t))\n   \\]\n   Using properties of the Fourier transform, we know:\n   \\[\n   F(\\dot{x}(t)) = iwF(x(t))\n   \\]\n   and\n   \\[\n   F(Mx(t)) = MF(x(t))\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the transformed equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   iwF(x(t)) = MF(x(t))\n   \\]\n\n3. **Eigenvalue Problem**: The equation \\( iwF(x(t)) = MF(x(t)) \\) can be seen as an eigenvalue problem where \\( iw \\) is the eigenvalue and \\( F(x(t)) \\) is the corresponding eigenvector. This means that the Fourier transform of the solution \\( x(t) \\) will have its spectrum (eigenvalues) determined by the matrix \\( M \\).\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the eigenvalues of \\( M \\) directly influence the Fourier transform \\( F(x(t)) \\) through the relationship \\( iw = \\lambda \\) (where \\( \\lambda \\) is an eigenvalue of \\( M \\)), the spectrum \\( F(x(t)) \\) at frequency \\( w \\) will indeed solely depend on the matrix \\( M \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}."
