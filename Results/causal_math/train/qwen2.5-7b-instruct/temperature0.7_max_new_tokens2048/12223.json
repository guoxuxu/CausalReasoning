Specifically, the transformation \\(g(t, z)\\) introduces a new factor \\(e^{BT}\\) which affects both the real and imaginary parts differently than the original function.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven only \\(z(T)\\), we cannot uniquely determine whether the transformation used was \\(g(t, z)\\), \\(h(t, z)\\), or both, because each transformation would result in a different end state due to the distinct scaling factors introduced by \\(e^{Bt}\\).
