This implies that the state vector \\( x(t) \\) evolves linearly over time according to the matrix \\( M \\).\n\n2. **Transformation**: The transformation \\( T(x) = Qx \\) is applied at some point in time. Without loss of generality, let's assume \\( T \\) is applied at time \\( t = 0 \\) for simplicity, but it could be at any time \\( t_0 \\).

If \\( T(x) = Qx \\) is applied, the state at \\( t = 0^+ \\) is \\( Qx(0) \\).

Generally, without additional information about \\( x(0) \\) or the specific form of \\( Q \\), it is not possible to uniquely determine \\( Q \\) from \\( x(T) \\) alone.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since the transformation \\( T(x) = Qx \\) modifies the initial state, and the subsequent evolution depends on the properties of \\( M \\) and \\( T \\), knowing only the endpoint \\( x(T) \\) does not provide enough information to uniquely determine the specific transformation \\( T(x) = Qx \\) or other potential transformations.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
