The general solution to this equation is:\n\n\\[ \\hat{u}(k,t) = \\hat{u}(k,0) e^{-k^2 t} \\]\n\nGiven the initial condition \\( \\hat{u}(k,0) = \\hat{u}_0(k) \\), we substitute this into the solution:\n\n\\[ \\hat{u}(k,t) = \\hat{u}_0(k) e^{-k^2 t} \\]\n\nFrom this, it is clear that the solution at any later time \\( t \\) depends on the initial condition \\( \\hat{u}_0(k) \\) and the exponential decay factor \\( e^{-k^2 t} \\).\n\nSince the presence of \\( e^{-k^2 t} \\) does not introduce any new dependence on \\( t \\) other than through the initial condition, the solution \\( \\hat{u}(k,t) \\) at any later time \\( t \\) still fundamentally depends on the initial condition \\( \\hat{u}_0(k) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Wave Equation**: The given equation is a first-order partial differential equation (PDE) in time for the Fourier transform of the wave function, \\( \\hat{u}(k,t) \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial \\hat{u}}{\\partial t} = -k^2 \\hat{u} + \\hat{f}(k,t)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Initial Condition**: We have the initial condition:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{u}(k,0) = \\hat{u}_0(k)\n   \\]\n   This means that at time \\( t = 0 \\), the value of \\( \\hat{u}(k,t) \\) is given by \\( \\hat{u}_0(k) \\).\n\n3. **External Force**: For \\( t > 0 \\), it is stated that no further force is applied, i.e., \\( \\hat{f}(k,t) = 0 \\). So the equation simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial \\hat{u}}{\\partial t} = -k^2 \\hat{u}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solving the Simplified Equation**: This is a linear homogeneous PDE. We can solve it using the method of separation of variables or recognizing it as a simple exponential decay:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial \\hat{u}}{\\partial t} = -k^2 \\hat{u}\n   \\]\n   The general solution to this equation is:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{u}(k,t) = \\hat{u}_0(k) e^{-k^2 t}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Dependence on Initial Condition**: From the solution above, we see that \\( \\hat{u}(k,t) \\) at any later time \\( t \\) depends solely on the initial condition \\( \\hat{u}_0(k) \\) and the time \\( t \\) through the exponential factor \\( e^{-k^2 t} \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since the external force term \\( \\hat{f}(k,t) \\) is zero after \\( t = 0 \\), the solution does not introduce any new dependencies other than the initial condition and the decay factor due to the \\( -k^2 \\) term.\n\nTherefore, the solution \\( \\hat{u}(k,t) \\) at a later time \\( t \\) depends only on the initial condition \\( \\hat{u}_0(k) \\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
