    "Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Transformation**: The linear transformation \\( T(z) = az + b \\) where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are complex constants, shifts and scales the complex number \\( z \\).\n\n2. **Applying the Transformation**: When we apply \\( T \\) to \\( z_0 \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   T(z_0) = az_0 + b\n   \\]\n\n3. **Computing \\( g(T(z_0)) \\)**: Now, we need to compute \\( g \\) at the transformed point \\( T(z_0) \\):\n   \\[\n   g(T(z_0)) = g(az_0 + b) = \\int_{0}^{az_0 + b} e^{s^2} ds\n   \\]\n\n4. **Comparing with \\( g(z_0) \\)**: Recall that:\n   \\[\n   g(z_0) = \\int_{0}^{z_0} e^{s^2} ds\n   \\]\n\n5. **Analyzing the Integrals**:\n   - \\( g(z_0) \\) is the integral from 0 to \\( z_0 \\).\n   - \\( g(az_0 + b) \\) is the integral from 0 to \\( az_0 + b \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Clearly, the limits of integration for \\( g(z_0) \\) and \\( g(az_0 + b) \\) are different.

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding \\( g(z) \\)**:\n   - The function \\( g(z) \\) is defined as an integral over the complex plane: \\( g(z) = \\int_{0}^{z} e^{s^2} ds \\).\n   - This integral does not have an elementary antiderivative, so it must be evaluated using numerical methods or special functions (like the error function).\n\n2. **Linear Transformation \\( T(z) \\)**:\n   - The transformation is given by \\( T(z) = az + b \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are complex constants.\n   - Applying \\( T \\) to \\( z_0 \\) gives us \\( T(z_0) = az_0 + b \\).\n\n3. **Evaluating \\( g(T(z_0)) \\)**:\n   - To find \\( g(T(z_0)) \\), we need to evaluate the integral from 0 to \\( az_0 + b \\): \\( g(T(z_0)) = \\int_{0}^{az_0 + b} e^{s^2} ds \\).\n\n4. **Comparing \\( g(T(z_0)) \\) and \\( g(z_0) \\)**:\n   - For \\( g(T(z_0)) \\) to equal \\( g(z_0) \\), the limits of integration would need to be the same.\n   - However, \\( g(z_0) = \\int_{0}^{z_0} e^{s^2} ds \\) has a different upper limit than \\( g(T(z_0)) \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the upper limits of integration are different (\\( z_0 \\) vs. \\( az_0 + b \\)), \\( g(T(z_0)) \\) cannot equal \\( g(z_0) \\) unless \\( az_0 + b = z_0 \\), which implies \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( b = 0 \\).
