Given that \\( D = K L K^{-1} \\), the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = Dz \\) can be rewritten using the similarity transformation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dt}(K z) = D(K z) \\implies \\frac{d}{dt}(K z) = K L K^{-1} (K z)\n   \\]\n   Letting \\( w = K z \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   \\dot{w} = L w\n   \\]\n   Since \\( L \\) is a diagonal matrix, the solution to this equation is:\n   \\[\n   w(t) = e^{Lt} w(0)\n   \\]\n   Therefore, \\( z(t) = K^{-1} w(t) = K^{-1} e^{Lt} K z(0) \\).\n\n4. **Direct Evolution**: If \\( z_0 \\) is evolved directly under \\( \\dot{z} = Dz \\):\n   \\[\n   z(t) = e^{Dt} z_0\n   \\]\n\n5. **Comparison**: We need to compare the two expressions for \\( z(T) \\):\n   - From the transformation and evolution: \\( z(T) = K^{-1} e^{LT} K z_0 \\)\n   - Direct evolution: \\( z(T) = e^{DT} z_0 \\)\n\n6. **Diagonalization Property**: Since \\( D = K L K^{-1} \\), it follows that \\( e^{DT} = K e^{LT} K^{-1} \\).

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State Transformation**: At \\( t = 0 \\), we have the initial state \\( z_0 \\). We apply the transformation \\( g(z_0) = K^{-1} e^{Lt} K z_0 \\).\n\n2. **System Evolution**: Under the dynamics \\( \\dot{z} = Dz \\), the state evolves over time. If we start with \\( z_0 \\), the state at time \\( T \\) would be \\( z(T) = e^{DT} z_0 \\).\n\n3. **Transformation Evolution**: Now, consider the transformed state \\( g(z_0) \\). We need to determine how this state evolves over time under the same dynamics \\( \\dot{z} = Dz \\).\n\n4. **Applying Dynamics to Transformed State**: Let's denote the transformed state at \\( t = 0 \\) as \\( w_0 = g(z_0) = K^{-1} e^{Lt} K z_0 \\). Since \\( D = K L K^{-1} \\), we can express the evolution of \\( w(t) \\) as:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dw}{dt} = D w(t) = K L K^{-1} w(t)\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( w(t) = K^{-1} e^{Lt} K z_0 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dt}(K^{-1} e^{Lt} K z_0) = K^{-1} L e^{Lt} K z_0\n   \\]\n   This shows that \\( w(t) = K^{-1} e^{Lt} K z_0 \\) is indeed the correct form for the transformed state.\n\n5. **Final State Comparison**: At time \\( T \\), the transformed state \\( w(T) \\) should be:\n   \\[\n   w(T) = K^{-1} e^{LT} K z_0\n   \\]\n   On the other hand, if we evolve \\( z_0 \\) directly under the dynamics, we get:\n   \\[\n   z(T) = e^{DT} z_0 = e^{K L K^{-1} T} z_0 = K e^{L T} K^{-1} z_0\n   \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since both expressions are identical:\n   \\[\n   K e^{L T} K^{-1} z_0 = K^{-1} e^{LT} K z_0\n   \\]\n   it follows that the state \\( z(T) \\) obtained by evolving \\( z_0 \\) directly under \\( \\dot{z} = Dz \\) is the same as the state \\( w(T) \\) obtained by first transforming \\( z_0 \\) to \\( g(z_0) \\) and then evolving it under the same dynamics.\n\nTherefore, the system state \\( z(T) \\) at time \\( T \\) will be the same whether \\( z_0 \\) is evolved directly or first transformed by \\( g(z) \\) and then evolved.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
