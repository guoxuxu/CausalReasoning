    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Fourier Transform**: The Fourier transform is a mathematical tool that decomposes a function (in our case, \\(x(t)\\)) into its constituent frequencies. It provides us with the amplitude and phase of each frequency component present in the original function.\n\n2. **Reconstruction of \\(x(t)\\)**: To reconstruct the time-domain function \\(x(t)\\) from its Fourier transform, we need to perform an inverse Fourier transform. This process essentially sums up all the frequency components weighted by their respective amplitudes and phases.\n\n3. **Information Content**: The Fourier transform of \\(x(t)\\) gives us the frequency spectrum but does not provide direct information about the phase or the exact timing of these frequency components in the time domain. \n\n4. **Initial Conditions**: For a second-order differential equation like \\(\\ddot{x} + p \\dot{x} + qx = 0\\), the solution depends on both the initial conditions (initial position and initial velocity) and the form of the forcing function (if any). Without specifying these initial conditions, there is an infinite number of possible functions that could have the same Fourier transform.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since the Fourier transform alone does not specify the initial conditions or the specific phase relationship between different frequency components, it is not sufficient to uniquely determine the exact form of \\(x(t)\\).\n\nTherefore, based on the above reasoning, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
