    "To determine if the integral value changes when deforming the contour while ensuring it still encloses the point \\(a\\), let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the Function and Contour Properties**:\n   - The function is \\( f(z) = \\frac{e^{z^2}}{z - a} \\).\n   - \\(a\\) is a complex constant.\n   - The integral is taken over a contour in the complex plane that encloses \\(a\\).\n\n2. **Cauchy's Integral Formula**:\n   - Cauchy's Integral Formula states that for a function \\(f(z)\\) that is analytic inside and on a simple closed contour \\(C\\), and for any point \\(a\\) inside \\(C\\),\n     \\[\n     f(a) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\oint_C \\frac{f(z)}{z-a} \\, dz.\n     \\]\n   - Here, \\(f(z) = e^{z^2}\\) is entire (analytic everywhere in the complex plane), so it is analytic inside and on any contour that does not pass through its poles.\n\n3. **Application to Our Function**:\n   - In our case, \\(f(z) = e^{z^2}\\) and the integrand becomes \\(\\frac{e^{z^2}}{z-a}\\).\n   - By Cauchy's Integral Formula, since \\(e^{z^2}\\) is analytic everywhere and \\(a\\) is inside the contour \\(C\\),\n     \\[\n     \\oint_C \\frac{e^{z^2}}{z-a} \\, dz = 2\\pi i e^{a^2}.\n     \\]\n   - This result is independent of the specific shape of the contour as long as it encloses \\(a\\).\n\n4. **Deformation of Contour**:\n   - Deforming the contour while keeping it simple and closed, and ensuring it still encloses \\(a\\), does not change the value of the integral because the function \\(\\frac{e^{z^2}}{z-a}\\) remains analytic within the deformed contour (as long as it doesn't pass through \\(a\\)).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Therefore, the integral value remains unchanged regardless of the shape of the contour as long as it encloses \\(a\\).\n\nGiven the above reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
