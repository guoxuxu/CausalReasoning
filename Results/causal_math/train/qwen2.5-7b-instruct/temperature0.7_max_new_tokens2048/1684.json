    "To determine whether the original time function \\( z(t) \\) was scaled based on the observation that the peak amplitude of \\( F(s) \\) has been altered but the position remains the same, we need to analyze the relationship between the scaling of \\( z(t) \\) and the Fourier transform \\( F(s) \\).\n\n1. **Original Function and Fourier Transform:**\n   - The original function is \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\).\n   - The Fourier transform is given by \\( F(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-2\\pi ist} z(t) \\, dt \\).\n\n2. **Scaling the Time Function:**\n   - Suppose \\( z(t) \\) is scaled by a factor \\( a \\), then the new function becomes \\( z_a(t) = e^{i \\omega at} \\).\n\n3. **Fourier Transform of the Scaled Function:**\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( z_a(t) \\) is:\n     \\[\n     F_a(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-2\\pi ist} e^{i \\omega at} \\, dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i (\\omega a - 2\\pi s) t} \\, dt.\n     \\]\n   - This integral is a shifted Dirac delta function:\n     \\[\n     F_a(s) = \\delta(s - \\frac{\\omega a}{2\\pi}).\n     \\]\n\n4. **Effect on Peak Amplitude:**\n   - The peak amplitude of \\( F(s) \\) is the value of \\( |F(s)| \\) at its peak, which occurs at \\( s = \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi} \\).\n   - For \\( F_a(s) \\), the peak amplitude occurs at \\( s = \\frac{\\omega a}{2\\pi} \\). If \\( a \\neq 1 \\), the peak shifts, but if the peak position remains the same, \\( a = 1 \\).\n   - However, the peak amplitude itself changes because the magnitude of the delta function depends on the scaling factor \\( a \\):\n     \\[\n     |F_a(s)| = |F(s)| \\cdot |a|.\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, altering the peak amplitude while keeping the position unchanged implies that \\( a \\neq 1 \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - If the peak amplitude of \\( F(s) \\) is altered but the position remains the same, it indicates that the original time function \\( z(t) \\) was indeed scaled.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Function and Transform**:\n   - The given function is \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\).\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) is defined as \\( F(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-2\\pi ist} z(t) \\, dt \\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform of \\( z(t) \\)**:\n   - Substituting \\( z(t) \\) into the Fourier transform definition:\n     \\[\n     F(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-2\\pi ist} e^{i \\omega t} \\, dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{i(\\omega - 2\\pi s)t} \\, dt.\n     \\]\n   - This integral represents a shifted Dirac delta function if we consider the properties of the Fourier transform:\n     \\[\n     F(s) = \\delta(s - \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi}).\n     \\]\n   - Here, \\( \\delta \\) is the Dirac delta function centered at \\( s = \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi} \\), indicating that the peak amplitude of \\( F(s) \\) occurs at \\( s = \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi} \\).\n\n3. **Effect of Scaling on \\( z(t) \\)**:\n   - If \\( z(t) \\) is scaled by a factor \\( A \\), then the new function becomes \\( z_A(t) = A e^{i \\omega t} \\).\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( z_A(t) \\) is:\n     \\[\n     F_A(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-2\\pi ist} A e^{i \\omega t} \\, dt = A \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{i(\\omega - 2\\pi s)t} \\, dt = A \\delta(s - \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi}).\n     \\]\n   - Here, the peak amplitude of \\( F_A(s) \\) is \\( A \\), and it still occurs at \\( s = \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi} \\).\n\n4. **Observation and Conclusion**:\n   - If the peak amplitude of \\( F(s) \\) is altered but the position remains the same, it indicates that the scaling factor \\( A \\) has changed the amplitude.\n   - Since the position (or the frequency shift) of the peak does not change, it confirms that the only change affecting the amplitude is the scaling of the original function \\( z(t) \\).\n\nTherefore, based on the above reasoning, if the peak amplitude of \\( F(s) \\) is altered but the position remains the same, it can indeed be determined that the original time function \\( z(t) \\) was scaled.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
