    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **System Dynamics**: The system is described by the differential equation \\(\\dot{x} = Dx + Cu\\), where \\(D\\) is a constant matrix, and \\(u\\) is the control input. This means that the evolution of the state vector \\(x\\) depends on both \\(D\\) and \\(u\\).\n\n2. **Integral Transformation**: The integral transformation is given by \\(h(x) = \\int_0^T e^{Ft}x(t) dt\\), where \\(F\\) is another constant matrix. This transformation integrates the state vector \\(x(t)\\) weighted by the matrix exponential \\(e^{Ft}\\) from 0 to \\(T\\).\n\n3. **Control Shift**: At time \\(t_1\\), a new control input \\(u'\\) replaces the original control input \\(u\\).
