    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have a vector function \\( u(x, t) \\) that evolves according to the PDE \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = L(u) \\), where \\( L \\) is a linear differential operator.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform**: Applying the Fourier transform to \\( u(x, t) \\) yields \\( v(k, t) = \\mathcal{F}[u(x, t)](k) \\). The Fourier transform converts the spatial domain representation into a frequency domain representation.\n\n3. **Effect of Linear Operator in Frequency Domain**: Since \\( L \\) is a linear differential operator, its action on \\( u(x, t) \\) in the spatial domain corresponds to multiplication by a function of \\( k \\) (the frequency variable) in the frequency domain. This means that \\( L(u) \\) transforms into \\( K(k) \\cdot v(k, t) \\), where \\( K(k) \\) is the Fourier transform of \\( L \\).\n\n4. **Evolution Equation in Frequency Domain**: The evolution equation in the frequency domain becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial v(k, t)}{\\partial t} = K(k) \\cdot v(k, t)\n   \\]\n   This is a simple ordinary differential equation (ODE) for each \\( k \\).\n\n5. **Applying a Filter Function**: If a filter function \\( H(k) \\) is applied, it modifies \\( v(k, t) \\) to \\( w(k, t) = H(k) \\cdot v(k, t) \\).

This is because the ODEs are linear and can be solved backward in time.\n\n7. **Recovering Initial State**: To recover the initial state \\( u(x, 0) \\), we need to know the inverse Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\) and the history of \\( v(k, t) \\) from \\( t = 0 \\) to \\( t = T \\).
