When \\(t = 0\\), \\(u = 0\\), and when \\(t \\to \\infty\\), \\(u \\to \\infty\\). Thus,\n     \\[\n     L(g)(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-s(\\frac{u}{\\alpha})} f(u) \\frac{du}{\\alpha} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\int_0^\\infty e^{-\\frac{s}{\\alpha} u} f(u) du.\n     \\]\n   - Recognizing that the integral is the Laplace transform of \\(f(u)\\) with the argument \\(\\frac{s}{\\alpha}\\), we get:\n     \\[\n     L(g)(s) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} L(f)\\left(\\frac{s}{\\alpha}\\right).\n     \\]\n\n3. **Analysis of Uniqueness:**\n   - From the above expression, we see that \\(L(g)(s)\\) depends on both \\(L(f)(s)\\) and \\(\\alpha\\).\n   - To uniquely determine \\(f(t)\\) and \\(\\alpha\\), we would need more information than just \\(L(g)(s)\\). Specifically, knowing \\(L(g)(s)\\) alone does not provide enough information to isolate both \\(f(t)\\) and \\(\\alpha\\) because:\n     - Different functions \\(f(t)\\) could have the same Laplace transform \\(L(f)(s)\\) (i.e., non-uniqueness of the inverse Laplace transform).\n     - The scaling factor \\(\\alpha\\) affects the argument of \\(L(f)(s)\\) but does not change the form of \\(L(f)(s)\\) itself.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Without additional constraints or information about \\(f(t)\\) or \\(\\alpha\\), it is not possible to uniquely determine both \\(f(t)\\) and \\(\\alpha\\) just from \\(L(g)(s)\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
