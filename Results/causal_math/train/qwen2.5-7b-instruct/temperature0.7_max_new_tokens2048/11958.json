    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: The temperature \\( T \\) changes according to the differential equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dT}{dt} = -k(T - T_{env})\n   \\]\n   where \\( T_{env} \\) is the environmental temperature, and \\( k \\) is a positive constant.\n\n2. **Environmental Temperature Shift**: At \\( t = 0 \\), there is a sudden shift in the environmental temperature \\( T_{env} \\) given by:\n   \\[\n   T_{env}(t) = T_{base} + H(t)S\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( H(t) \\) is the Heaviside step function which equals 0 for \\( t < 0 \\) and 1 for \\( t \\geq 0 \\). Therefore, immediately after \\( t = 0 \\), \\( T_{env}(t) \\) becomes \\( T_{base} + S \\).\n\n3. **Cooling System Intervention**: After the shift, a cooling system intervenes to enforce a constant temperature \\( T_c \\). This means that once the system starts enforcing the temperature, \\( T \\) will be kept at \\( T_c \\).\n\n4. **Differential Equation Analysis**:\n   - For \\( t < 0 \\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{dT}{dt} = -k(T - T_{base})\n     \\]\n     The solution to this differential equation is:\n     \\[\n     T(t) = T_{base} + (T(0) - T_{base})e^{-kt}\n     \\]\n   - For \\( t \\geq 0 \\):\n     Since the cooling system enforces a constant temperature \\( T_c \\), we have:\n     \\[\n     T(t) = T_c \\quad \\text{for all } t \\geq 0\n     \\]\n\n5. **Dependence on \\( S \\)**:\n   - The initial condition at \\( t = 0^+ \\) (just after the shift) is determined by the value of \\( T \\) at \\( t = 0^- \\) and the new \\( T_{env} \\):\n     \\[\n     T(0^+) = T(0^-) + kS\n     \\]\n   - However, once the cooling system starts enforcing \\( T_c \\), the temperature \\( T \\) will be held at \\( T_c \\) regardless of the initial conditions or the value of \\( S \\).\n\nTherefore, the final operational temperature \\( T \\) will be \\( T_c \\) and it does not depend on the magnitude of \\( S \\) after the cooling system intervenes.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Condition and Differential Equation**:\n   - The differential equation given is \\( \\frac{dT}{dt} = -k(T - T_{env}) \\).\n   - Initially, the environmental temperature changes from \\( T_{base} \\) to \\( T_{base} + S \\) at \\( t = 0 \\).\n\n2. **Behavior Before and After the Shift**:\n   - Before \\( t = 0 \\), \\( T_{env} = T_{base} \\).\n   - After \\( t = 0 \\), \\( T_{env} = T_{base} + S \\).\n\n3. **Intervention of Cooling System**:\n   - A cooling system enforces a constant temperature \\( T_c \\) after some time.\n   - This means that once the cooling system takes effect, \\( T = T_c \\).\n\n4. **Effect of \\( S \\)**:\n   - The value of \\( S \\) determines the magnitude of the temperature shift in the environment.\n   - However, once the cooling system sets the temperature to \\( T_c \\), the system will maintain this temperature regardless of the initial or subsequent changes in \\( T_{env} \\).\n\n5. **Final Operational Temperature**:\n   - Since the cooling system enforces a constant temperature \\( T_c \\), the final operational temperature will be \\( T_c \\).\n   - This final temperature does not depend on the magnitude of the initial shift \\( S \\); it depends solely on the settings of the cooling system.\n\nTherefore, the final operational temperature will indeed depend only on the settings of the cooling system, regardless of \\( S \\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**:\n   - The differential equation governing temperature \\( T \\) is given by \\( \\frac{dT}{dt} = -k(T - T_{env}) \\).\n   - The environmental temperature \\( T_{env} \\) changes suddenly at \\( t = 0 \\) according to \\( T_{env}(t) = T_{base} + H(t)S \\).\n\n2. **Behavior Before and After the Shift**:\n   - For \\( t < 0 \\), \\( T_{env}(t) = T_{base} \\). So, the differential equation simplifies to \\( \\frac{dT}{dt} = -k(T - T_{base}) \\).\n   - For \\( t > 0 \\), \\( T_{env}(t) = T_{base} + S \\). So, the differential equation becomes \\( \\frac{dT}{dt} = -k(T - (T_{base} + S)) \\).\n\n3. **Intervention of Cooling System**:\n   - A cooling system enforces a constant temperature \\( T_c \\) after the shift. This means that for \\( t > 0 \\), \\( T(t) = T_c \\).\n\n4. **Effect of \\( S \\)**:\n   - The value of \\( S \\) affects the initial condition and the behavior of \\( T_{env} \\) after the shift.\n   - However, once the cooling system sets \\( T(t) = T_c \\) for \\( t > 0 \\), the temperature \\( T \\) is no longer dependent on \\( S \\) because it is forced to be constant.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The final operational temperature \\( T_c \\) will be determined solely by the settings of the cooling system, not by the magnitude of the shift \\( S \\).\n\nGiven this reasoning, the final operational temperature will indeed depend only on the settings of the cooling system and not on \\( S \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
