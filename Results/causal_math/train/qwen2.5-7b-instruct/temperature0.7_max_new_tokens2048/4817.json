However, the key point is that \\( f(z) \\) itself introduces a multiplicative factor due to its derivative.\n\n6. **Change of variables**: Using the change of variables formula for complex integrals, the integral transforms as:\n   \\[ \\int_{C'} e^{z^2} dz = \\int_{-∞}^{+∞} e^{(f^{-1}(e^{gz}))^2} \\frac{d(f^{-1}(e^{gz}))}{dz} e^{gz} dz \\]\n\n7. **Simplification**: The term \\( \\frac{d(f^{-1}(e^{gz}))}{dz} e^{gz} \\) simplifies to a complex number that multiplies the original integrand. Importantly, this multiplier is not 1 in general, meaning the integral will change unless specific conditions are met (like \\( g \\) being purely imaginary).\n\n8. **Conclusion**: Given the transformation involves a non-trivial change of variables and the integrand is modified by a factor that depends on \\( g \\), the value of the integral will generally change.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",

We need to express \\( z \\) as a function of \\( w \\), i.e., \\( z = f^{-1}(w) \\).\n   - Since \\( f(z) = e^{gz} \\), we have \\( w = e^{gz} \\).
