The wave equation is linear, meaning the principle of superposition holds. This means that if two functions \\( h(x) \\) and \\( j(x) \\) are both solutions to the equation, then their sum is also a solution.\n\n6. If we apply \\( h(x) \\) initially and then at \\( t = t_1 \\) apply \\( j(x) \\), the total displacement \\( u(x, t) \\) at any later time \\( T \\) (where \\( T > t_1 \\)) will be the sum of the responses to \\( h(x) \\) and \\( j(x) \\).\n\n7. Since \\( j(x) \\) is applied after \\( t_1 \\), its effect will propagate according to the wave equation from \\( t_1 \\) onwards. This means it will contribute to the displacement at \\( T \\).\n\n8. Therefore, the displacement \\( u(x, T) \\) will depend on both the initial function \\( h(x) \\) and the intervention \\( j(x) \\).\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}"
