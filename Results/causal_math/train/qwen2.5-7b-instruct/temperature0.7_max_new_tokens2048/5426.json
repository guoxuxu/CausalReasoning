However, \\( g(z) = e^{z^2} \\) has no singularities and is entire, so the integral might be path-independent under certain conditions.\n\n4. **Reconstructing the Path**: Even if the integral is path-independent, knowing the value of the integral alone does not provide enough information to uniquely determine the path \\( z(t) \\). Different paths can lead to the same integral value due to the nature of complex integration and the periodicity of the exponential function.\n\n5. **Lack of Initial and Final Points**: Without knowledge of the initial and final points, the problem becomes even more complex. Many different paths can start at one point and end at another while having the same integral value.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Given the above considerations, it is not possible to accurately reconstruct the specific path \\( z(t) \\) solely from the integral result of \\( g(z) \\) along that path without additional information such as the endpoints of the path.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
