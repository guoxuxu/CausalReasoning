This means:\n   - \\( z(0) = z_0 \\)\n   - Applying the transformation: \\( g(z_0) = z_0 e^{i\\omega \\cdot 0} = z_0 \\)\n\n3. **Evolution Under Natural Trajectory**: If no further transformations are applied, the system evolves naturally according to \\( z(t) = R(t)e^{i\\theta(t)} \\). So at \\( t = T \\):\n   - \\( z(T) = R(T)e^{i\\theta(T)} \\)\n   - Since there is no additional transformation, \\( R(T) \\) and \\( \\theta(T) \\) follow their original trajectories.\n\n4. **Applying Transformation and Then Evolving**: Now consider applying the transformation first and then letting the system evolve:\n   - At \\( t = 0 \\): \\( z(0) = z_0 \\)\n   - Applying \\( g(z_0) \\): \\( z(0) \\rightarrow z_0 e^{i\\omega \\cdot 0} = z_0 \\)\n   - Letting it evolve: \\( z(T) = (z_0 e^{i\\omega \\cdot 0}) e^{i\\omega T} = z_0 e^{i\\omega T} \\)\n   - Therefore, \\( z(T) = R_0 e^{i(\\theta_0 + \\omega T)} \\)\n\n5. **Comparison**: Compare the two scenarios:\n   - Without transformation: \\( z(T) = R(T)e^{i\\theta(T)} \\)\n   - With transformation: \\( z(T) = R_0 e^{i(\\theta_0 + \\omega T)} \\)\n\nFor the positions to be the same, \\( R(T) \\) must equal \\( R_0 \\) and \\( \\theta(T) \\) must equal \\( \\theta_0 + \\omega T \\). However, since the transformation changes the phase by \\( \\omega T \\) but not the amplitude, the positions will only be the same if the initial radial component \\( R_0 \\) remains unchanged and the phase shift exactly matches the natural evolution.\n\nGiven that the transformation does not affect \\( R(t) \\) and only shifts the phase, the positions will be different unless \\( \\theta_0 + \\omega T \\) aligns with the natural evolution of \\( \\theta(t) \\) which is not guaranteed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
