    "Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Original Circuit Dynamics**: The given differential equation describes the dynamics of a series RLC circuit without any external voltage sources other than the initial conditions. This equation is:\n   \\[\n   V(t) = L \\frac{dI}{dt} + RI + \\frac{1}{C}\\int I dt\n   \\]\n   To solve this, we would typically take the Laplace transform assuming zero initial conditions for simplicity.\n\n2. **Introduction of V1**: At time \\(t = t_1\\), an additional independent voltage source \\(V_1\\) is introduced. This changes the dynamics of the circuit starting from \\(t = t_1\\). The new differential equation now includes \\(V_1\\):\n   \\[\n   V(t) = L \\frac{dI}{dt} + RI + \\frac{1}{C}\\int I dt + V_1 \\cdot u(t - t_1)\n   \\]\n   Here, \\(u(t - t_1)\\) is the unit step function which ensures that \\(V_1\\) only affects the system after \\(t = t_1\\).\n\n3. **Taking Laplace Transform**: Taking the Laplace transform of both sides, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{V(t)\\}(s) = L \\mathcal{L}\\left\\{\\frac{dI}{dt}\\right\\}(s) + R \\mathcal{L}\\{I(t)\\}(s) + \\frac{1}{C} \\mathcal{L}\\left\\{\\int I dt\\right\\}(s) + \\mathcal{L}\\{V_1 \\cdot u(t - t_1)\\}(s)\n   \\]\n   Using properties of the Laplace transform, this becomes:\n   \\[\n   V(s) = L(sI(s) - I(t_1)) + RI(s) + \\frac{1}{Cs}I(s) + \\frac{V_1}{s}e^{-t_1 s}\n   \\]\n   Assuming zero initial conditions for simplicity (i.e., \\(I(t_1^-) = 0\\)), this simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   V(s) = (Ls + R + \\frac{1}{Cs})I(s) + \\frac{V_1}{s}e^{-t_1 s}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solving for I(s)**: Solving for \\(I(s)\\), we get:\n   \\[\n   I(s) = \\frac{V(s) - \\frac{V_1}{s}e^{-t_1 s}}{Ls + R + \\frac{1}{Cs}}\n   \\]\n   For \\(t > t_1\\), the term \\(\\frac{V_1}{s}e^{-t_1 s}\\) is significant and depends on \\(V_1\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The Laplace transform of \\(I(t)\\) at time \\(T > t_1\\) will include the effect of \\(V_1\\), making it dependent on \\(V_1\\) as well as the original parameters \\(R\\), \\(L\\), and \\(C\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
