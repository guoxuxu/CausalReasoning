This transforms the spatial variable \\(x\\) into the frequency domain \\(k\\).\n\n3. **Evolution in Frequency Domain**: In the frequency domain, the heat equation simplifies due to the linearity of the Fourier transform. Specifically, the transformed heat equation becomes \\(\\frac{\\partial \\hat{u}}{\\partial t} = -k^2 \\hat{u}\\). This is a simple ordinary differential equation in time \\(t\\).\n\n4. **Solution in Frequency Domain**: Solving the ODE \\(\\frac{\\partial \\hat{u}}{\\partial t} = -k^2 \\hat{u}\\) with the initial condition \\(\\hat{u}(k, t_1)\\), we get \\(\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\hat{u}(k, t_1) e^{-k^2 (t - t_1)}\\).\n\n5. **Inverse Fourier Transform**: To find \\(u(x, T)\\) for \\(T > t_1\\), we need to take the inverse Fourier transform of \\(\\hat{u}(k, T)\\):\n   \\[\n   u(x, T) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\left[\\hat{u}(k, T)\\right] = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{ikx} \\hat{u}(k, T) \\, dk = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{ikx} \\hat{u}(k, t_1) e^{-k^2 (T - t_1)} \\, dk.\n   \\]\n   This integral can be evaluated using properties of the Gaussian function, showing that the solution \\(u(x, T)\\) is still determined by the original initial condition \\(u(x, 0)\\) through the heat kernel.\n\n6. **Predictability Using Only the Heat Equation**: Since the solution at any time \\(T > t_1\\) can be derived from the initial condition and the heat equation, it means that the predictability of \\(u(x, T)\\) does not depend on the Fourier transform operation at \\(t_1\\). The heat equation alone, along with the initial condition, is sufficient to determine the solution at any later time.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"} because the solution at time \\(T\\) (for \\(T > t_1\\)) can indeed be predicted using only the heat equation and the initial condition."
