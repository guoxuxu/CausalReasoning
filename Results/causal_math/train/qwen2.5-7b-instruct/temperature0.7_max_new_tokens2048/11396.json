The current response to a specific input (like \\(v(t) = V_0 e^{st}\\)) would be different for different values of L, R, and C, but without knowing the exact values of these parameters or the history of the circuit, we cannot deduce a past impedance change solely from the current value at one time point.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and the single data point of current at time T, we cannot determine with certainty whether the impedance was changed at time \\(t_1\\) or earlier.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}"
