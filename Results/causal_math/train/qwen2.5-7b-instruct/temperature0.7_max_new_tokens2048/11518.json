However, multiple functions can have the same Laplace transform if they differ by functions that are zero in the region of convergence. For example, \\( e^{iwx} + h(x) \\) where \\( h(x) \\) is zero for \\( x \\geq 0 \\) would also have the same Laplace transform.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   Given only \\( F(s) = \\frac{1}{s - iw} \\), we cannot definitively conclude that the original function was exactly \\( e^{iwx} \\) without additional information about the function's behavior in the time domain. There could be other functions that have the same Laplace transform.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
