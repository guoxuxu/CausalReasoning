    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Contour Integral**:\n   - The contour integral \\( f(z) = \\int_C g(w) dw \\) involves integrating the function \\( g(w) \\) over a closed contour \\( C \\) in the complex plane.\n   - Similarly, \\( f'(z) = \\int_{C'} h(w) dw \\) involves integrating the function \\( h(w) \\) over a potentially different closed contour \\( C' \\).\n\n2. **Properties of Exponential Functions**:\n   - Both \\( g(z) = e^z \\) and \\( h(z) = e^{-z} \\) are entire functions (holomorphic everywhere in the complex plane).\n   - They are periodic with period \\( 2\\pi i \\) in the imaginary direction, but they have different behaviors under integration due to their opposite signs in the exponent.\n\n3. **Effect on Contour Integration**:\n   - For a closed contour \\( C \\), if \\( g(z) = e^z \\), the integral \\( \\int_C e^z dz \\) will generally not be zero unless \\( C \\) is a specific path (like a circle centered at the origin with radius 0, which is a single point).\n   - Similarly, for \\( h(z) = e^{-z} \\), the integral \\( \\int_C e^{-z} dz \\) will also generally not be zero for most contours \\( C \\).\n\n4. **Analyzing the Given Information**:\n   - We know the result of \\( f'(z) = \\int_{C'} h(w) dw \\).

Specifically, \\( f(z) = \\int_C g(w) dw \\) for some function \\( g(w) \\).\n\n2. **Given Functions**:\n   - \\( g(z) = e^z \\)\n   - \\( h(z) = e^{-z} \\)\n\n3. **Contour Path Changes**: The problem mentions that the path \\( C \\) can be modified to another path \\( C' \\). However, the nature of the function \\( g(z) \\) or \\( h(z) \\) does not change based on the path alone. The value of the contour integral depends on the function being integrated and the properties of the path (like orientation and smoothness).\n\n4. **Effect of Different Functions**: \n   - If \\( g(z) = e^z \\), then \\( f(z) = \\int_C e^w dw \\).\n   - If \\( h(z) = e^{-z} \\), then \\( f(z) = \\int_C e^{-w} dw \\).\n\n5. **Determining the Function**:\n   - Without additional information about the path \\( C \\) or specific values of the integral, it is not possible to definitively determine which function \\( g(z) \\) or \\( h(z) \\) was used just from the value of \\( f(z) \\).\n   - The integral of \\( e^z \\) and \\( e^{-z} \\) over different paths will generally yield different results unless the path is such that these functions have special properties (e.g., if the path encloses singularities or if the integrals happen to cancel out due to symmetry).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given only the result of the contour integral and no additional context about the path or specific values, we cannot determine with certainty whether the initial function applied was \\( g(z) = e^z \\) or \\( h(z) = e^{-z} \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
