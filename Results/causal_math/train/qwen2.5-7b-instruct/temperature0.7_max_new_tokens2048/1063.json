    "Let's analyze the given problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: The differential equation is \\( z'(t) = z(t)^2 \\). This describes how \\( z(t) \\) changes over time.\n\n2. **Transformation with \\( g(z) \\)**: We apply an exponential transformation \\( g(z) = e^{Ct} z \\). This means that at any time \\( t \\), the value of \\( z \\) is scaled by \\( e^{Ct} \\).\n\n3. **Intervention with \\( h(z) \\)**: At a certain time \\( t_1 \\), we introduce a new function \\( h(z) = e^{Dt} z \\).

    "Let's analyze the given problem step by step:\n\n1. **Original Differential Equation**: The function \\( z(t) \\) evolves according to the differential equation \\( z'(t) = z(t)^2 \\).\n\n2. **Exponential Transformation**: An initial transformation \\( g(z) = e^{Ct} z \\) is applied. This means that the transformed function is \\( g(z) = e^{Ct} z \\). However, this transformation is not directly applied to the differential equation but rather to the function itself. The differential equation remains unchanged under this transformation because it is linear in \\( z \\).\n\n3. **Intervention with Another Exponential Transformation**: At a certain time \\( t_1 \\), a new transformation \\( h(z) = e^{Dt} z \\) is applied. This means the function now becomes \\( h(z) = e^{Dt} z \\). Again, this transformation does not change the underlying differential equation but modifies the function.\n\n4. **Endpoint Analysis**: To determine if the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) depends only on the initial condition \\( z_0 \\) and not on \\( C \\) or \\( D \\), we need to consider how these transformations affect the solution of the differential equation.\n\nThe original differential equation \\( z'(t) = z(t)^2 \\) has the general solution:\n\\[ z(t) = \\frac{1}{c - t} \\]\nwhere \\( c \\) is a constant determined by the initial condition \\( z(0) = z_0 \\). So, \\( c = \\frac{1}{z_0} \\).\n\nNow, let's see how the transformations affect this solution:\n- The first transformation \\( g(z) = e^{Ct} z \\) changes the function to \\( e^{Ct} \\frac{1}{c - t} \\).\n- The second transformation \\( h(z) = e^{Dt} z \\) further changes the function to \\( e^{Dt} e^{Ct} \\frac{1}{c - t} = e^{(D+C)t} \\frac{1}{c - t} \\).\n\nAt the endpoint \\( T \\):\n\\[ z(T) = e^{(D+C)T} \\frac{1}{c - T} \\]\n\nThis shows that the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) does indeed depend on both \\( C \\) and \\( D \\) through the term \\( e^{(D+C)T} \\).
