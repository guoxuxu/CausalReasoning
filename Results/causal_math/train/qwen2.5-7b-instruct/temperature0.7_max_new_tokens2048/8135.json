    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the transformations**:\n   - The first transformation is the Laplace transform \\( f(z) \\) of \\( z(t) \\).\n   - The second transformation is \\( g(z) = e^{At}z \\), which applies a matrix exponential to \\( z(t) \\).\n   - The third transformation is \\( h(z) = e^{-Bt}z \\), which applies another matrix exponential to \\( z(t) \\).\n\n2. **Effect of \\( g(z) \\)**:\n   - When \\( g(z) = e^{At}z \\) is applied, it modifies \\( z(t) \\) to \\( e^{At}z \\). This means that the original function \\( z(t) \\) is now scaled by the matrix exponential \\( e^{At} \\).\n\n3. **Effect of \\( h(z) \\)**:\n   - When \\( h(z) = e^{-Bt}z \\) is applied, it modifies \\( z(t) \\) to \\( e^{-Bt}z \\). This means that the modified function from step 2, \\( e^{At}z \\), is now scaled by \\( e^{-Bt} \\).\n\n4. **Combining the transformations**:\n   - The combined effect of applying both \\( g(z) \\) and \\( h(z) \\) is \\( e^{-Bt}e^{At}z \\).
