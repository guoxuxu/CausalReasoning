    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Fourier Transform**: The Fourier Transform \\( F(y)(\\omega) \\) converts the time-domain signal \\( y(t) \\) into its frequency-domain representation. This process decomposes the signal into its constituent frequencies.\n\n2. **Inverse Fourier Transform**: Applying the inverse Fourier Transform would convert the frequency-domain representation back into the time-domain. The inverse Fourier Transform is given by:\n   \\[\n   y(t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} F(y)(\\omega) e^{i\\omega t} d\\omega\n   \\]\n   This process reconstructs the original time-domain signal from its frequency components.\n\n3. **External Modulation by \\( h(t) \\)**: If a function \\( h(t) \\) modulates \\( y(t) \\) at a specific time \\( t_1 \\), the effect of this modulation can be represented as:\n   \\[\n   y'(t) = y(t) \\cdot h(t - t_1)\n   \\]\n   This means that the signal \\( y(t) \\) is multiplied by \\( h(t - t_1) \\) at the time \\( t_1 \\).\n\n4. **Effect on the Fourier Transform**: Modulating \\( y(t) \\) with \\( h(t - t_1) \\) shifts the phase of the Fourier Transform of \\( y(t) \\) by \\( -2\\pi f t_1 \\). Specifically, if \\( H(\\omega) \\) is the Fourier Transform of \\( h(t) \\), then the Fourier Transform of \\( y'(t) \\) becomes:\n   \\[\n   F(y')(t) = F(y(t)) \\cdot H(\\omega) e^{-i\\omega t_1}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determining Modulation**: To determine if a modulation by \\( h(t) \\) occurred at time \\( t_1 \\), we need to check for a phase shift in the frequency domain at \\( \\omega = 2\\pi f t_1 \\). However, simply looking at the state of \\( y(T) \\) after applying the inverse Fourier Transform does not provide enough information to determine this phase shift. The inverse Fourier Transform only gives us the time-domain signal \\( y(t) \\), but it does not retain the phase information introduced by the modulation.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Examining \\( y(T) \\) alone does not allow us to determine if a modulation by \\( h(t) \\) occurred at a specific time \\( t_1 \\) because the phase information that would indicate such a modulation is lost in the time-domain representation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

Specifically, if \\( h(t) \\) is non-zero only at \\( t = t_1 \\), it would introduce a spike or impulse at that point in the time-domain signal.\n\n4. **Effect on Inverse Transform**: When we apply the inverse Fourier Transform to the modulated signal, the resulting time-domain signal will show the effect of the modulation. If \\( h(t) \\) was applied at \\( t_1 \\), the inverse transform would reveal a change or disturbance at that exact time.\n\n5. **Determining Specific Modulation**: To determine if a modulation occurred at a specific time \\( t_1 \\), we need to examine the reconstructed time-domain signal \\( y(t) \\).
