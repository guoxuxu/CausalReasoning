    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Transformation**: The given integral transformation \\( T_w[f](x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-wt} f(t) dt \\) is essentially a weighted integral of the function \\( f(t) \\) with the weight being \\( e^{-wt} \\).\n\n2. **Function Form**: We are considering the specific form \\( f(t) = e^{At} \\), where \\( A \\) is a complex constant. This means that we are looking at the Laplace transform of \\( e^{At} \\).\n\n3. **Laplace Transform of \\( e^{At} \\)**: The Laplace transform of \\( e^{At} \\) is well-known and can be derived as follows:\n   - For a general function \\( e^{at} \\), the Laplace transform is \\( \\frac{1}{s-a} \\).\n   - Here, \\( a = A \\) and the transform is taken with respect to \\( t \\) and evaluated at \\( s = w \\).\n\n4. **Applying the Transform**: Substituting \\( f(t) = e^{At} \\) into the integral, we get:\n   \\[\n   T_w[e^{At}](x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-wt} e^{At} dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{(A-w)t} dt\n   \\]\n   - This integral converges if the real part of \\( A - w \\) is negative.\n   - If it converges, the result is:\n     \\[\n     T_w[e^{At}](x) = \\frac{1}{w-A}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Interpreting the Output**: Given the output of the transformation \\( T_w[g](x) \\), which is \\( \\frac{1}{w-A} \\), we need to determine if we can uniquely identify the original function \\( f(t) = e^{At} \\) from this output.\n\n6. **Uniqueness of the Transformation**: The Laplace transform is a one-to-one mapping for functions that satisfy certain conditions (like being of exponential order). Therefore, given \\( T_w[e^{At}](x) = \\frac{1}{w-A} \\), we can uniquely determine that the original function was \\( e^{At} \\).\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Since the output uniquely corresponds to the input function \\( e^{At} \\), we can determine the specific form of the function \\( f(t) \\) based solely on the output of the transformation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
