    "To analyze whether changing the contour from \\( C \\) to \\( C' \\) affects the value of \\( F(z) \\), we need to consider the properties of complex line integrals and the specific conditions under which the integral's value might remain unchanged.\n\n1. **Initial Condition**: At \\( t = 0 \\), \\( F(z) \\) is computed along contour \\( C \\).

    "To analyze the impact of changing the contour from \\( C \\) to \\( C' \\) on the value of the integral \\( F(z) \\), we need to consider several factors:\n\n1. **Contour Integration and Cauchy's Theorem**: If the function \\( e^{zt} f(t) \\) is analytic (holomorphic) inside and on both contours \\( C \\) and \\( C' \\), then by Cauchy's theorem, the integral over any closed contour is zero, and the integral over two different paths between the same endpoints will be the same, provided they do not cross singularities of the integrand.\n\n2. **Homotopy and Deformation of Contours**: If \\( C \\) and \\( C' \\) are homotopic (can be continuously deformed into each other without crossing any singularities of the integrand), then the integral remains unchanged. This is a fundamental result in complex analysis.\n\n3. **Singularities and Branch Cuts**: If there are singularities or branch points between \\( C \\) and \\( C' \\), the value of the integral may change because the function \\( e^{zt} f(t) \\) might not be analytic across these points.\n\n4. **Time Dependence**: The problem mentions that \\( F(z) \\) is computed at \\( t = 0 \\) along \\( C \\), and then the contour is changed to \\( C' \\) at a later time \\( t = T \\). The function \\( f(t) \\) is time-dependent, so the integrand \\( e^{zt} f(t) \\) changes with time. This means that even if \\( C \\) and \\( C' \\) are homotopic, the value of the integral can differ if the function \\( f(t) \\) has different values at \\( t = 0 \\) and \\( t = T \\).\n\nGiven these considerations, let's reason through the scenario:\n\n- If \\( C \\) and \\( C' \\) are homotopic and the function \\( e^{zt} f(t) \\) does not have any singularities or branch points between them, then the integral should remain the same.\n- However, since the problem states that the contour is changed \"at a later time without further intervention,\" and considering that \\( f(t) \\) is time-dependent, it implies that \\( f(t) \\) could have different values at \\( t = 0 \\) and \\( t = T \\).\n- Therefore, the integral \\( F(z) \\) computed along \\( C' \\) at \\( t = T \\) would generally not be the same as if it were computed along \\( C \\) at \\( t = T \\), unless \\( f(t) \\) happens to be constant over the interval from \\( t = 0 \\) to \\( t = T \\).\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "To determine whether \\( F(z) \\) computed at \\( t = T \\) along contour \\( C' \\) will be the same as if calculated along \\( C \\), we need to consider the properties of contour integrals and the conditions under which such transformations might preserve the value of the integral.\n\n1. **Contour Integration and Cauchy's Theorem**: According to Cauchy's theorem, if \\( f(t) \\) is analytic (holomorphic) within and on a closed contour \\( C \\), then the integral over \\( C \\) is zero. However, this theorem applies only to closed contours and does not directly address the issue of changing the path of integration.\n\n2. **Homotopy and Path Independence**: If the function \\( f(t) \\) is analytic within and on the region enclosed by both \\( C \\) and \\( C' \\), and these contours are homotopic (can be continuously deformed into each other without leaving the region), then the integral over either contour will be the same. This is a consequence of the Cauchy integral theorem for homotopic paths.\n\n3. **Change in Contour Without Further Intervention**: The key phrase \"without further intervention\" suggests that no additional singularities or branch cuts are introduced when the contour is changed from \\( C \\) to \\( C' \\). If the new contour \\( C' \\) does not enclose any additional singularities of \\( f(t) \\) compared to \\( C \\), and the function \\( f(t) \\) remains analytic in the region between the two contours, then the integral values should remain the same.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: If \\( f(t) \\) is analytic within and on both \\( C \\) and \\( C' \\), and there are no additional singularities or branch points introduced by the change from \\( C \\) to \\( C' \\), then the value of \\( F(z) \\) computed at \\( t = T \\) along \\( C' \\) should indeed be the same as if calculated along \\( C \\).\n\nGiven these considerations, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
