    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Original Function and Differential Equation**:\n   - We start with \\( z(t) \\) evolving according to \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\).\n   - This is a first-order linear differential equation, and its solution is \\( z(t) = z_0 e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\( z_0 \\) is the initial value of \\( z \\).\n\n2. **Transformation \\( g(z) \\)**:\n   - The function \\( g(z) = e^{\\alpha t}z \\) is applied to transform \\( z(t) \\).\n   - Applying this transformation, we get \\( g(z(t)) = e^{\\alpha t} z(t) = e^{\\alpha t} z_0 e^{i\\omega t} = z_0 e^{(\\alpha + i\\omega)t} \\).\n\n3. **Intervention \\( h(z) \\)**:\n   - At time \\( t_1 \\), a new function \\( h(z) = e^{\\beta t}z \\) is applied.\n   - This means we have \\( h(g(z(t))) = e^{\\beta t} g(z(t)) = e^{\\beta t} e^{\\alpha t} z(t) = e^{(\\alpha + \\beta)t} z(t) \\).\n\n4. **Behavior After Intervention**:\n   - From \\( t_1 \\) onwards, the new form of \\( z(t) \\) becomes \\( e^{(\\alpha + \\beta)(t - t_1)} z(t_1) \\).\n   - Since \\( z(t_1) = z_0 e^{i\\omega t_1} \\), we substitute this into the expression:\n     \\[\n     z(t) = z_0 e^{i\\omega t_1} e^{(\\alpha + \\beta)(t - t_1)} = z_0 e^{i\\omega t_1} e^{(\\alpha + \\beta)t - (\\alpha + \\beta)t_1} = z_0 e^{i\\omega t_1} e^{(\\alpha + \\beta)t} e^{-(\\alpha + \\beta)t_1}\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying, we get:\n     \\[\n     z(t) = z_0 e^{i\\omega t_1} e^{(\\alpha + \\beta)t} e^{-(\\alpha + \\beta)t_1} = z_0 e^{i\\omega t_1} e^{(\\alpha + \\beta)(t - t_1)} e^{(\\alpha + \\beta)t_1}\n     \\]\n   - The term \\( e^{(\\alpha + \\beta)t_1} \\) is a constant and can be absorbed into \\( z_0 \\).
