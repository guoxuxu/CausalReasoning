    "To analyze whether it's possible to unequivocally determine the initial value \\( w_0 \\) from observing a sequence generated by the dynamics of \\( z(w) \\), let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Transformation**: The function \\( z(w) = w^2 + c \\) is a nonlinear transformation where \\( c \\) is a complex constant.
