The value of the integral is highly dependent on the properties of the integrand, particularly the behavior around the singularity at \\( z = w \\). Since the denominator is the same, the primary difference lies in the numerator due to the change in 'a'.\n\n7.

    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand the original integral**: The original integral is \\( g(z) = \\int_{C} \\frac{e^{az}}{z - w} dz \\). Here, the integrand has a simple pole at \\( z = w \\).\n\n2. **Effect of modifying 'a'**: If we modify 'a' to 'a + b', the new integral becomes \\( g'(z) = \\int_{C} \\frac{e^{(a+b)z}}{z - w} dz \\).\n\n3. **Comparison of integrals**: We need to compare \\( g(z) \\) and \\( g'(z) \\):\n   - \\( g(z) = \\int_{C} \\frac{e^{az}}{z - w} dz \\)\n   - \\( g'(z) = \\int_{C} \\frac{e^{(a+b)z}}{z - w} dz \\)\n\n4. **Using properties of exponentials**: Notice that \\( e^{(a+b)z} = e^{az} \\cdot e^{bz} \\).
