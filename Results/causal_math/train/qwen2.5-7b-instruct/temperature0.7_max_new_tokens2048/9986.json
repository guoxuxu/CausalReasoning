Specifically, the Laplace transform of a constant \\( c \\) is \\( \\frac{c}{s} \\).\n\n3. **Isolate the original function's Laplace transform**: From the equation \\( G(s) = F(s) + \\frac{c}{s} \\), we can isolate \\( F(s) \\) by subtracting \\( \\frac{c}{s} \\) from both sides:\n   \\[\n   F(s) = G(s) - \\frac{c}{s}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine \\( c \\)**: To find \\( c \\), we need to look at the behavior of \\( G(s) \\) as \\( s \\) approaches infinity. As \\( s \\to \\infty \\), the term \\( \\frac{c}{s} \\) approaches 0. Therefore, the limit of \\( G(s) \\) as \\( s \\to \\infty \\) should equal the limit of \\( F(s) \\) as \\( s \\to \\infty \\). This gives us:\n   \\[\n   \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} G(s) = \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} F(s)\n   \\]\n   Since \\( F(s) \\) is the Laplace transform of \\( f(t) \\), we can write:\n   \\[\n   \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} F(s) = \\lim_{t \\to 0^+} f(t)\n   \\]\n   Thus, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} G(s) = \\lim_{t \\to 0^+} f(t)\n   \\]\n   This provides a way to determine \\( c \\) if we know \\( \\lim_{t \\to 0^+} f(t) \\).\n\n5. **Uniquely determine \\( f(t) \\) and \\( c \\)**: With \\( F(s) \\) determined from \\( G(s) \\), we can find \\( f(t) \\) by taking the inverse Laplace transform of \\( F(s) \\). However, knowing only \\( G(s) \\) does not provide enough information to uniquely determine both \\( f(t) \\) and \\( c \\) without additional constraints on \\( f(t) \\) itself (e.g., initial conditions).\n\nBased on the above reasoning, we cannot uniquely determine both the original function \\( f(t) \\) and the constant \\( c \\) just from the given information about \\( G(s) \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Transformation**: The Laplace transform of a function \\( f(t) \\) is given by \\( F(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) \\, dt \\).\n\n2. **Transformation of Shifted Function**: For the shifted function \\( g(t) = f(t) + c \\), the Laplace transform is:\n   \\[\n   G(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} (f(t) + c) \\, dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) \\, dt + \\int_{0}^{\\infty} ce^{-st} \\, dt = F(s) + \\frac{c}{s}\n   \\]\n   This shows that \\( G(s) = F(s) + \\frac{c}{s} \\).\n\n3. **Reversing the Process**: To determine \\( f(t) \\) and \\( c \\) from \\( G(s) \\):\n   - Subtract \\( \\frac{c}{s} \\) from \\( G(s) \\) to get \\( F(s) \\).\n   - Inverse Laplace transform \\( F(s) \\) to get \\( f(t) \\).\n   - From \\( F(s) = G(s) - \\frac{c}{s} \\), we can solve for \\( c \\) if we know \\( F(s) \\).\n\n4. **Uniqueness**: The process described above is theoretically reversible, but it relies on knowing \\( F(s) \\). Without additional information about \\( f(t) \\) or constraints on \\( c \\), we cannot uniquely determine both \\( f(t) \\) and \\( c \\) from \\( G(s) \\) alone. There could be multiple pairs \\( (f(t), c) \\) that satisfy the same \\( G(s) \\).\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the steps above, we cannot uniquely determine both the original function \\( f(t) \\) and the constant \\( c \\) used for the shift without extra information.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
