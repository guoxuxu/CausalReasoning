    "To determine whether we can infer the exact original vector \\( z_0 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) without knowing if \\( g(z) \\) was applied initially, let's analyze the given information step-by-step.\n\n1. **Differential Equation**: The system is governed by the differential equation \\(\\dot{z} = iAz\\), where \\(A\\) is a real constant matrix. This implies that the solution to this differential equation is:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0\n   \\]\n   where \\(z_0\\) is the initial condition at \\(t=0\\).\n\n2. **Integral Transformation**: The integral transformation is defined as \\( g(z) = \\int_0^t e^{iB\\tau}z d\\tau \\). This transformation involves integrating the vector \\(z\\) over time with a factor \\(e^{iB\\tau}\\).\n\n3. **Impact of \\(g(z)\\)**: The application of \\(g(z)\\) introduces additional complexity because \\(B\\) does not necessarily commute with \\(A\\). However, the presence of \\(g(z)\\) does not directly affect the determination of \\(z_0\\) from \\(z(t)\\) for a specific \\(t\\), unless \\(g(z)\\) changes the form of \\(z(t)\\) in a way that alters the relationship between \\(z(t)\\) and \\(z_0\\).\n\n4. **Inference of \\(z_0\\)**: To infer \\(z_0\\) from \\(z(t)\\), we need to reverse the evolution given by the differential equation. For \\(z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0\\), the inverse operation is:\n   \\[\n   z_0 = e^{-iAt}z(t)\n   \\]\n   This means that even if \\(g(z)\\) was applied, it would be possible to reverse the effect of \\(g(z)\\) and still recover \\(z_0\\) from \\(z(t)\\) using the above formula, assuming we know \\(t\\) and \\(A\\).\n\nSince the integral transformation \\(g(z)\\) does not fundamentally alter the relationship between \\(z(t)\\) and \\(z_0\\) in a way that makes \\(z_0\\) uncomputable, we can infer the exact original vector \\(z_0\\) at \\(t = 0\\) from \\(z(t)\\) regardless of whether \\(g(z)\\) was applied initially.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
