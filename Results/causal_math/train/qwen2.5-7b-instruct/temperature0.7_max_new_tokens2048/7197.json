    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Initial Setup**:\n   - We have a complex-valued function \\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\).\n   - The system applies a convolution operator \\(L\\) with kernel \\(k(t)\\) to \\(z(t)\\) to produce \\(w(t)\\).\n\n2. **Convolution Operation**:\n   - The convolution operation can be expressed as \\(w(t) = (z * k)(t)\\), which means \\(w(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} z(\\tau) k(t - \\tau) d\\tau\\).\n\n3. **Effect of Changing the Kernel**:\n   - If we alter the kernel \\(k(t)\\) after the initial convolution has been performed, it does not affect the already computed \\(w(t)\\) because the convolution is a point-wise operation that depends only on the values of \\(z(t)\\) and the current value of \\(k(t)\\) at each point.\n   - Changing \\(k(t)\\) after the convolution has been computed would not change the previously computed values of \\(w(t)\\).\n\n4. **Fourier Transform Consideration**:\n   - The Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) is a linear operation.
