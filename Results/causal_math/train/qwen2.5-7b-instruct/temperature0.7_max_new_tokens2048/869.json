This transfer function relates the Laplace transform of the output \\(Y(s)\\) to the Laplace transform of the input \\(U(s)\\): \\(Y(s) = H(s)U(s)\\).\n\n3. **Step Input**: The control input \\(u(t)\\) changes from 0 to a step function at \\(t = 0\\). In the Laplace domain, a step function \\(u(t)\\) transforms to \\(U(s) = \\frac{1}{s}\\).\n\n4. **System Response in Laplace Domain**: To find the system's response to the step input in the Laplace domain, we need to solve for \\(X(s)\\) in the equation \\(X(s) = (sI - A)^{-1}Bu(s)\\).
