    "Let's analyze the given problem step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the Integral Equation**:\n   The given integral equation is \\(I(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-x^2 + xt} dt\\).\n\n2. **Identify the Fourier Transform**:\n   The Fourier transform of \\(I(x)\\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}(I)(k) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty I(x) e^{-ikx} dx\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\(I(x)\\) into the Fourier transform definition, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}(I)(k) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-t^2 + tx} dt \\right) e^{-ikx} dx\n   \\]\n\n3. **Interchange the Order of Integration** (if applicable):\n   To simplify, we need to interchange the order of integration. This requires checking if the conditions for Fubini's theorem are satisfied. Assuming the integrals converge appropriately, we can write:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}(I)(k) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-t^2} \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{tx - ikx} dx \\right) dt\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the inner integral:\n   \\[\n   \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{x(t - ik)} dx = \\frac{1}{ik - t}\n   \\]\n   Therefore,\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}(I)(k) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-t^2} \\frac{1}{ik - t} dt\n   \\]\n\n4. **Identify the Laplace Transform**:\n   The Laplace transform of \\(I(x)\\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}(I)(s) = \\int_{0}^\\infty I(x) e^{-sx} dx\n   \\]\n   However, our integral \\(I(x)\\) extends from \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(\\infty\\), so we cannot directly apply the Laplace transform in its standard form. Instead, we need to consider the Fourier-Laplace combined transform, which typically involves complex analysis techniques.\n\n5. **Determine the Order of Transforms**:\n   Given that we have already applied the Fourier transform to obtain \\(\\mathcal{F}(I)(k)\\), and we are asked whether it was applied before the Laplace transform, we need to understand that the Laplace transform is typically applied to functions of time, while the Fourier transform is applied to functions of frequency. Since we have already computed the Fourier transform, the Laplace transform would be applied to the result of the Fourier transform.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   Based on the steps above, the Fourier transform was indeed applied before the Laplace transform. The resultant function from the Fourier transform is then used as input for the Laplace transform.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
