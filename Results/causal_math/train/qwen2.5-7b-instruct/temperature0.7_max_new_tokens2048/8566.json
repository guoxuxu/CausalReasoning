    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. Understanding the Problem:\n   - We're dealing with complex integration along a closed contour γ in the complex plane.\n   - The function f(z) is being integrated.\n   - We know the integral is non-zero.\n\n2. Cauchy's Integral Theorem:\n   - This theorem states that if f(z) is analytic (holomorphic) inside and on a simple closed contour γ, then the integral of f(z) over γ is zero.\n   - This means that for a non-zero integral, f(z) cannot be analytic everywhere inside γ.\n\n3. Cauchy's Integral Formula:\n   - If f(z) has a pole at some point inside γ, then the integral of f(z) over γ will be non-zero.\n   - However, the converse is not necessarily true; other singularities or non-analytic points could also cause a non-zero integral.\n\n4. Other Possibilities:\n   - There could be essential singularities inside γ that would also result in a non-zero integral.\n   - There could be branch points or cuts in the function that affect the integral.\n\n5. Conclusion:\n   - While a non-zero integral suggests that f(z) is not analytic everywhere inside γ, it does not definitively indicate the presence of a pole.\n   - Other types of singularities or non-analytic behavior could also result in a non-zero integral.\n\nTherefore, based on this reasoning, we cannot conclusively state that there was definitely a pole within the contour γ just because the integral is non-zero.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Complex Integration Basics**: The integral \\(\\int_{\\gamma} f(z) \\, dz\\) is defined for a function \\(f(z)\\) integrated along a contour \\(\\gamma\\) in the complex plane.\n\n2. **Cauchy's Integral Theorem**: This theorem states that if \\(f(z)\\) is analytic (holomorphic) in a simply connected domain containing the contour \\(\\gamma\\), then \\(\\int_{\\gamma} f(z) \\, dz = 0\\).\n\n3. **Cauchy's Integral Formula and Residue Theorem**: If \\(f(z)\\) has poles inside the contour \\(\\gamma\\), the integral can be non-zero.
