    "To determine if the resulting Laplace Transform \\(\\mathcal{L}\\{f'\\}(s)\\) is a direct addition of \\(\\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}(s)\\) and \\(\\mathcal{L}\\{g\\}(s)\\), we need to consider the properties of the Laplace transform.\n\n1. **Definition of the Laplace Transform**: The Laplace transform of a function \\(h(t)\\) (where \\(t\\) is a real variable) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{h\\}(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} h(t) e^{-st} dt\n   \\]\n\n2. **Linearity Property**: One of the key properties of the Laplace transform is its linearity. This means that for any two functions \\(h_1(t)\\) and \\(h_2(t)\\), and any constants \\(a\\) and \\(b\\):\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{ah_1(t) + bh_2(t)\\}(s) = a\\mathcal{L}\\{h_1(t)\\}(s) + b\\mathcal{L}\\{h_2(t)\\}(s)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Application to the Problem**: In our case, \\(f'(z) = f(z) + g(z)\\). Assuming \\(f(z)\\) and \\(g(z)\\) are functions of a real variable \\(t\\) (since the Laplace transform is typically applied to real-valued functions of time), we can apply the linearity property directly:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{f'(t)\\}(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t) + g(t)\\}(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\}(s) + \\mathcal{L}\\{g(t)\\}(s)\n   \\]\n\nGiven this reasoning, the Laplace transform of \\(f'(t)\\) is indeed the direct addition of the Laplace transforms of \\(f(t)\\) and \\(g(t)\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}."
