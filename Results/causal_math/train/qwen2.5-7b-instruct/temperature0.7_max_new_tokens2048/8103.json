This changes the state of the system from \\(u(x, t_1)\\) to a new function \\(v(x, t_1)\\), where \\(v(x, t_1) = Mu(x, t_1)\\). However, this intervention does not directly affect the transformed state \\(\\hat{u}(k, t)\\) for \\(t > t_1\\) because the Fourier transform is applied to the original \\(u(x,t)\\) before the intervention.\n\n4. **Post-Intervention Evolution**: After the intervention, the system continues to evolve according to the original operator \\(L\\) (or potentially a modified operator if the intervention affects the operator itself, which is not specified here).
