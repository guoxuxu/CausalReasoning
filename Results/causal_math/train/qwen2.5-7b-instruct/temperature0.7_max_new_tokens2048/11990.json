This function is periodic with frequency \\( ω \\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform**: The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) will convert it from the time domain to the frequency domain. For \\( z(t) = e^{iωt} \\), the Fourier transform is a Dirac delta function centered at \\( ω \\). Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   Z(f) = \\mathcal{F}\\{e^{iωt}\\} = 2πδ(f - ω)\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( Z(f) \\) represents the Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) and \\( δ(f - ω) \\) is the Dirac delta function.\n\n3. **Linear Time-Invariant System**: A linear time-invariant (LTI) system has an impulse response \\( h(t) \\). When an input signal \\( x(t) \\) passes through such a system, the output \\( y(t) \\) is given by the convolution of \\( x(t) \\) and \\( h(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   y(t) = (x * h)(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(\\tau)h(t - \\tau) d\\tau\n   \\]\n\n4. **Impulse Response and Fourier Transform**: The Fourier transform of the impulse response \\( h(t) \\) is denoted as \\( H(f) \\). The output of the LTI system in the frequency domain is then given by the product of the Fourier transforms of the input and the impulse response:\n   \\[\n   Y(f) = X(f)H(f)\n   \\]\n   where \\( Y(f) \\) is the Fourier transform of the output \\( y(t) \\), \\( X(f) \\) is the Fourier transform of the input \\( x(t) \\), and \\( H(f) \\) is the Fourier transform of the impulse response \\( h(t) \\).\n\n5. **Applying to the Problem**: In our case, the input \\( x(t) \\) is \\( z(t) \\), so:\n   \\[\n   X(f) = Z(f) = 2πδ(f - ω)\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the output in the frequency domain after passing through the LTI system is:\n   \\[\n   Y(f) = Z(f)H(f) = 2πδ(f - ω)H(f)\n   \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The output in the frequency domain \\( Y(f) \\) is a scaled version of \\( H(f) \\) at the frequency \\( ω \\). Specifically, \\( Y(f) \\) is zero everywhere except at \\( f = ω \\), where it is \\( 2πH(ω) \\). Thus, the output in the frequency domain depends on both the original \\( ω \\) and the value of \\( H(f) \\) at \\( f = ω \\).\n\nGiven the above analysis, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "To address this question, let's break down the process step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Function \\( z(t) \\)**:\n   - The function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) represents a complex exponential with a constant angular frequency \\( \\omega \\).\n   - This function is periodic in the frequency domain with the same frequency \\( \\omega \\).\n\n2. **Applying the Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) System**:\n   - An LTI system has an impulse response \\( h(t) \\). When this system processes the input \\( z(t) \\), it can be described using convolution in the time domain:\n     \\[\n     y(t) = z(t) * h(t)\n     \\]\n   - In the frequency domain, convolution in the time domain corresponds to multiplication:\n     \\[\n     Y(f) = Z(f) \\cdot H(f)\n     \\]\n     where \\( Y(f) \\), \\( Z(f) \\), and \\( H(f) \\) are the Fourier transforms of \\( y(t) \\), \\( z(t) \\), and \\( h(t) \\) respectively.\n\n3. **Fourier Transform of \\( z(t) \\)**:\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) is a Dirac delta function:\n     \\[\n     Z(f) = 2\\pi \\delta(f - \\omega)\n     \\]\n     where \\( \\delta(f) \\) is the Dirac delta function.\n\n4. **Effect of the LTI System**:\n   - The Fourier transform of the output \\( y(t) \\) will be:\n     \\[\n     Y(f) = Z(f) \\cdot H(f) = 2\\pi \\delta(f - \\omega) \\cdot H(f)\n     \\]\n   - Multiplication by a Dirac delta function shifts \\( H(f) \\) to the frequency \\( \\omega \\):\n     \\[\n     Y(f) = 2\\pi H(\\omega) \\delta(f - \\omega)\n     \\]\n\n5. **Implications for Frequency Domain Output**:\n   - The output in the frequency domain \\( Y(f) \\) depends on both the original \\( \\omega \\) and the value of \\( H(\\omega) \\), which is the frequency response of the LTI system at frequency \\( \\omega \\).\n\nGiven this analysis, the output in the frequency domain does not solely depend on the original \\( \\omega \\); it also depends on the value of \\( H(\\omega) \\), which is influenced by the impulse response \\( h(t) \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "To determine if the output in the frequency domain depends only on the original \\( \\omega \\) and is independent of \\( h(t) \\), let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding \\( z(t) \\):**\n   - The function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) is a complex exponential function.\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) is a Dirac delta function in the frequency domain, specifically \\( Z(f) = 2\\pi \\delta(f - \\omega) \\).\n\n2. **Intervention with \\( h(t) \\):**\n   - The system has an impulse response \\( h(t) \\).\n   - The output of the system when \\( z(t) \\) is input can be described using the convolution theorem: \\( y(t) = z(t) * h(t) \\).\n   - In the frequency domain, this becomes \\( Y(f) = Z(f)H(f) \\), where \\( H(f) \\) is the Fourier transform of \\( h(t) \\).\n\n3. **Fourier Transform of the Output:**\n   - The Fourier transform of the output \\( y(t) \\) is given by multiplying the Fourier transforms of \\( z(t) \\) and \\( h(t) \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( Y(f) = 2\\pi \\delta(f - \\omega) H(f) \\).\n\n4. **Dependence on \\( \\omega \\) and \\( h(t) \\):**\n   - The term \\( 2\\pi \\delta(f - \\omega) \\) indicates that the frequency content is concentrated at \\( f = \\omega \\).\n   - The factor \\( H(f) \\) modifies the amplitude at this frequency.\n   - Hence, while the basic frequency component remains \\( \\omega \\), the amplitude and phase can be altered by \\( H(f) \\).\n\nGiven this analysis, the output in the frequency domain not only depends on the original \\( \\omega \\) but also on the characteristics of \\( h(t) \\), specifically through \\( H(f) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
