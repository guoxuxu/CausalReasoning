    "To answer this question, let's first compute the Laplace transform of the given functions and then compare them.\n\n1. **Compute the Laplace Transform of \\( h(x) = e^{rx} \\):**\n\n\\[ H(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-sx} e^{rx} dx = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{(r-s)x} dx \\]\n\nFor the integral to converge, we need \\( r - s < 0 \\) or \\( s > r \\).

    "To address this question, let's first derive the Laplace transform for both given functions and then analyze if we can distinguish between them based on the final form of \\(H(s)\\).\n\n1. **Laplace Transform of \\(h(x) = e^{rx}\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   H(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-sx} e^{rx} dx = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{(r-s)x} dx\n   \\]\n\n   This integral converges if \\(s > r\\).
