    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Circuit Analysis**:\n   - The circuit consists of an inductor (L) and a resistor (R) in series.\n   - The voltage source is given by \\( V(t) = V_0 e^{i\\omega t} \\).\n   - The voltage across the inductor is \\( V_L = L \\frac{dI}{dt} \\).\n   - The voltage across the resistor is \\( V_R = RI \\).\n\n2. **Impedance and Current Relationship**:\n   - For a series RLC circuit with AC input, the impedance \\( Z \\) is given by \\( Z = R + j\\omega L \\).\n   - The current \\( I(t) \\) can be expressed as \\( I(t) = \\frac{V_0}{Z} e^{i(\\omega t - \\phi)} \\), where \\( \\phi \\) is the phase angle.\n   - The amplitude of the current \\( |I(t)| \\) is \\( \\frac{V_0}{|Z|} \\).\n\n3. **Effect of Frequency on Impedance**:\n   - As the frequency \\( \\omega \\) increases, the imaginary part of the impedance \\( Z \\) also increases because \\( Z = R + j\\omega L \\).\n   - This means that the magnitude of the impedance \\( |Z| \\) increases as \\( \\omega \\) increases.\n\n4. **Amplitude of Current**:\n   - Since \\( |I(t)| = \\frac{V_0}{|Z|} \\), and \\( |Z| \\) increases with \\( \\omega \\), the amplitude of the current \\( |I(t)| \\) decreases as \\( \\omega \\) increases.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - If the frequency \\( \\omega \\) of the voltage source is increased from \\( \\omega_0 \\) to \\( \\omega_1 \\), the amplitude of the current \\( I(t) \\) will indeed decrease.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
    "To determine if the amplitude of the current \\(I(t)\\) decreases when the frequency \\(\\omega\\) of the voltage source is increased from \\(\\omega_0\\) to \\(\\omega_1\\), we need to analyze the behavior of the circuit under these conditions.\n\n1. **Circuit Analysis**:\n   - The total impedance \\(Z\\) of the series circuit consisting of an inductor \\(L\\) and a resistor \\(R\\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     Z = R + j\\omega L\n     \\]\n     where \\(j\\) is the imaginary unit.\n\n2. **Current Calculation**:\n   - The current \\(I(t)\\) in the circuit can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     I(t) = \\frac{V(t)}{Z}\n     \\]\n   - Given the voltage source \\(V(t) = V_0 e^{i\\omega t}\\), the current becomes:\n     \\[\n     I(t) = \\frac{V_0 e^{i\\omega t}}{R + j\\omega L}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Impedance Magnitude**:\n   - The magnitude of the impedance \\(|Z|\\) is:\n     \\[\n     |Z| = \\sqrt{R^2 + (\\omega L)^2}\n     \\]\n   - As \\(\\omega\\) increases, the term \\((\\omega L)^2\\) also increases, leading to an increase in the magnitude of the impedance \\(|Z|\\).\n\n4. **Current Amplitude**:\n   - The amplitude of the current \\(I(t)\\) is:\n     \\[\n     |I(t)| = \\frac{|V_0|}{|Z|}\n     \\]\n   - Since \\(|Z|\\) increases with \\(\\omega\\), the amplitude of the current \\(|I(t)|\\) decreases as \\(\\omega\\) increases.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Therefore, if the frequency \\(\\omega\\) of the voltage source is increased from \\(\\omega_0\\) to \\(\\omega_1\\), the amplitude of the current \\(I(t)\\) will indeed decrease.\n\nThe final answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}."
