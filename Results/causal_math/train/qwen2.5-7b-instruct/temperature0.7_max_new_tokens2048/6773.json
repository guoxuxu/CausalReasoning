    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have the Sturm-Liouville problem:\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + q(x)y = \\lambda y\n   \\]\n   with boundary conditions \\( y(0) = 0 \\) and \\( y(1) = 0 \\).\n\n2. **Transformation**: The eigenfunction \\( y_0(x) \\) is transformed to \\( f(y_0) = ky_0 \\), where \\( k \\) is a constant.\n\n3. **Evolution Under Original Equation**: We need to check if the transformed function \\( ky_0 \\) satisfies the original Sturm-Liouville equation:\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{d^2(ky_0)}{dx^2} + q(x)(ky_0) = \\lambda (ky_0)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplification**:\n   - The second derivative of \\( ky_0 \\) is \\( k \\frac{d^2y_0}{dx^2} \\).\n   - Substituting into the equation, we get:\n     \\[\n     -k \\frac{d^2y_0}{dx^2} + q(x)ky_0 = \\lambda ky_0\n     \\]\n   - Factoring out \\( k \\) on the left-hand side, we have:\n     \\[\n     k \\left( -\\frac{d^2y_0}{dx^2} + q(x)y_0 \\right) = \\lambda ky_0\n     \\]\n\n5. **Eigenvalue Condition**: Since \\( y_0 \\) is an eigenfunction of the original Sturm-Liouville problem, it satisfies:\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{d^2y_0}{dx^2} + q(x)y_0 = \\lambda y_0\n   \\]\n   Substituting this into our equation gives:\n   \\[\n   k (\\lambda y_0) = \\lambda ky_0\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   \\lambda ky_0 = \\lambda ky_0\n   \\]\n   which is always true for any non-zero \\( k \\) and \\( \\lambda \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The transformed function \\( ky_0 \\) indeed satisfies the original Sturm-Liouville equation. Therefore, \\( ky_0 \\) is an eigenfunction of the original problem, but with the same eigenvalue \\( \\lambda \\).\n\nThus, the transformed function qualifies as an eigenfunction of the untransformed problem.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\": \"Yes\"}",
    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Original Sturm-Liouville Problem**: The given differential equation is \\(-\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + q(x)y = \\lambda y\\) with boundary conditions \\(y(0) = 0\\) and \\(y(1) = 0\\).\n\n2. **Eigenfunction Transformation**: Consider an eigenfunction \\(y_0(x)\\) of the original problem, which satisfies:\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{d^2y_0}{dx^2} + q(x)y_0 = \\lambda y_0\n   \\]\n   Applying the transformation \\(f(y) = ky\\), we get a new function \\(ky_0(x)\\).\n\n3. **Substitute Transformed Function into Original Equation**: Substitute \\(ky_0(x)\\) into the original differential equation:\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{d^2(ky_0)}{dx^2} + q(x)(ky_0) = \\lambda (ky_0)\n   \\]\n   Simplify the left side:\n   \\[\n   -k\\frac{d^2y_0}{dx^2} + kq(x)y_0 = \\lambda k y_0\n   \\]\n   Factor out \\(k\\):\n   \\[\n   k\\left(-\\frac{d^2y_0}{dx^2} + q(x)y_0\\right) = \\lambda k y_0\n   \\]\n   Since \\(y_0(x)\\) is an eigenfunction of the original problem, we know that:\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{d^2y_0}{dx^2} + q(x)y_0 = \\lambda y_0\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the equation simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   k(\\lambda y_0) = \\lambda (k y_0)\n   \\]\n   This shows that \\(ky_0(x)\\) satisfies the original differential equation with the same eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\).\n\n4. **Boundary Conditions Check**: We need to check if \\(ky_0(x)\\) also satisfies the boundary conditions \\(y(0) = 0\\) and \\(y(1) = 0\\):\n   \\[\n   ky_0(0) = k \\cdot 0 = 0\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   ky_0(1) = k \\cdot 0 = 0\n   \\]\n   Thus, \\(ky_0(x)\\) satisfies both boundary conditions.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since \\(ky_0(x)\\) satisfies the original differential equation and the boundary conditions, it qualifies as an eigenfunction of the untransformed problem.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}."
