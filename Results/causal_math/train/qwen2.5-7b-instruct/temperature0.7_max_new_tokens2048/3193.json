The phase shift remains primarily determined by the original \\(\\omega\\) (or more accurately, the product \\(\\omega RC\\)) because the phase shift formula is independent of the specific \\(\\omega\\) once \\(R\\) and \\(C\\) are fixed.\n\nTherefore, the phase shift of the output voltage across the capacitor will not change solely based on the original \\(\\omega\\) if the frequency changes to \\(\\omega'\\) without any other intervention.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "To determine if the phase shift of the output voltage across the capacitor \\(v(t)\\) is solely determined by the original \\(\\omega\\) when the input voltage changes frequency from \\(\\omega\\) to \\(\\omega'\\), let's reason through the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: The input voltage is given as \\(u(t) = U_0 e^{i\\omega t}\\). For a series RC circuit, the impedance of the circuit is given by:\n   \\[\n   Z = R + \\frac{1}{i\\omega C} = R - i\\frac{1}{\\omega C}\n   \\]\n   where \\(R\\) is the resistance and \\(C\\) is the capacitance.\n\n2. **Impedance Analysis**: The impedance \\(Z\\) has both real (resistive) and imaginary (reactive) parts. The phase angle \\(\\phi\\) of the impedance is:\n   \\[\n   \\tan(\\phi) = -\\frac{1}{\\omega RC}\n   \\]\n   This means that the phase shift \\(\\phi\\) between the input voltage and the output voltage across the capacitor is determined by \\(\\omega\\).\n\n3. **Effect of Frequency Change**: If the input frequency changes from \\(\\omega\\) to \\(\\omega'\\), the new impedance becomes:\n   \\[\n   Z' = R - i\\frac{1}{\\omega'C}\n   \\]\n   The new phase angle \\(\\phi'\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\tan(\\phi') = -\\frac{1}{\\omega'RC}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Phase Shift Comparison**: The phase shift \\(\\phi\\) is directly proportional to \\(-\\frac{1}{\\omega C}\\). Therefore, changing \\(\\omega\\) to \\(\\omega'\\) changes the phase shift. Specifically, the phase shift is now determined by \\(\\omega'\\) rather than \\(\\omega\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since the phase shift is now determined by the new frequency \\(\\omega'\\), it is not solely determined by the original \\(\\omega\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}."
