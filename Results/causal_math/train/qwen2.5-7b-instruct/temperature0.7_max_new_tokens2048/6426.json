    "To determine whether we can uniquely determine the original function \\( z(t) = t + it^2 \\) given only the Laplace transform value at \\( s = 2 \\), let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to check if knowing the Laplace transform of \\( z(t) \\) at a single point (specifically \\( s = 2 \\)) is enough to uniquely determine the original function \\( z(t) \\).\n\n2. **Laplace Transform Definition**: The Laplace transform of \\( z(t) \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}(z)(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt\n   \\]\n   For \\( z(t) = t + it^2 \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}(z)(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} (t + it^2) dt\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Laplace Transform**:\n   - Split the integral into two parts:\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{L}(z)(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} t dt + i \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} t^2 dt\n     \\]\n   - Use known Laplace transform pairs:\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{L}\\{t\\}(s) = \\frac{1}{s^2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\mathcal{L}\\{t^2\\}(s) = \\frac{2}{s^3}\n     \\]\n   - Substitute these into the expression:\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{L}(z)(s) = \\frac{1}{s^2} + i \\frac{2}{s^3}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Evaluate at \\( s = 2 \\)**:\n   - Substitute \\( s = 2 \\):\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{L}(z)(2) = \\frac{1}{2^2} + i \\frac{2}{2^3} = \\frac{1}{4} + i \\frac{1}{4}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Uniqueness of Inverse Laplace Transform**:\n   - The inverse Laplace transform is not generally unique without additional information about the region of convergence or other constraints.\n   - Knowing only one value of the Laplace transform does not provide sufficient information to uniquely determine the original function \\( z(t) \\). There could be many different functions that have the same Laplace transform at a single point.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the Laplace transform is not unique for a single point, we cannot uniquely determine \\( z(t) \\) from just the value of its Laplace transform at \\( s = 2 \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

Knowing the Laplace transform at a single point does not provide enough information to uniquely determine the original function because there could be other functions that have the same Laplace transform at that specific point but differ elsewhere.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: While the Laplace transform evaluated at \\( s = 2 \\) gives us a specific value, it does not uniquely determine the original function \\( z(t) \\) because multiple functions can share the same Laplace transform value at a single point.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
