    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step to determine if the output state at time \\(T\\) solely depends on the original mapping \\(w(z) = z^2 + 2z + 1\\).\n\n1. **Original Mapping**: The function \\(w(z) = z^2 + 2z + 1\\) describes the initial state of the system in the complex plane. This function maps each point \\(z\\) in the complex plane to another point \\(w\\) according to the polynomial expression provided.\n\n2. **Integral Transformation**: The integral transformation given is \\(F(w) = \\int e^{-st} w(t) \\, dt\\). Here, \\(s\\) is a complex number. This integral transformation modifies the function \\(w(t)\\) over time \\(t\\).\n\n3. **Time Evolution**: If the system evolves through time without any external integral transformations, it means that the function \\(w(t)\\) remains unchanged from its initial form \\(w(z)\\). Therefore, at any time \\(t\\), including \\(T\\), the function would still be \\(w(t) = t^2 + 2t + 1\\).\n\n4. **Impact of Integral Transformation**: The integral transformation \\(F(w)\\) introduces a time-dependent modification to \\(w(t)\\). However, the problem specifically asks about the output state at time \\(T\\) \"solely\" depending on the original mapping \\(w(z)\\). Since the transformation \\(F(w)\\) involves integrating over all times (from 0 to \\(T\\)), it implies that the output state at time \\(T\\) includes contributions from the entire history of the system up to \\(T\\), not just the initial state.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given that the integral transformation \\(F(w)\\) takes into account the evolution of \\(w(t)\\) from \\(0\\) to \\(T\\), the output state at time \\(T\\) cannot solely depend on the original mapping \\(w(z)\\) but also incorporates the effects of the integral transformation.\n\nTherefore, the output state at time \\(T\\) does not solely depend on the original mapping \\(w(z) = z^2 + 2z + 1\\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
