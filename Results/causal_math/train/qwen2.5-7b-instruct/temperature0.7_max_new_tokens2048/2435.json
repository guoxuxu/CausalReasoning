Specifically, the Fourier transform of \\( t \\cdot f(t) \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}\\{t \\cdot f(t)\\} = -\\frac{d}{ds} F(s)\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the Fourier transform of \\( h(t) = \\lambda t \\cdot f(t) \\) is:\n   \\[\n   H(\\omega) = \\lambda \\left( -\\frac{d}{ds} F(s) \\right)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Independence from \\( g(t) \\)**: The question asks if the Fourier transform \\( H(\\omega) \\) at \\( t = T \\) is independent of the original function \\( g(t) \\) applied in the Laplace setting. Since the Fourier transform of \\( h(t) \\) depends on the derivative of the Laplace transform \\( F(s) \\), and not directly on \\( g(t) \\), we need to clarify what \\( g(t) \\) represents. If \\( g(t) \\) is not explicitly part of the definition of \\( f(t) \\), then the answer would be that the Fourier transform \\( H(\\omega) \\) is indeed independent of \\( g(t) \\).\n\nGiven the above steps and reasoning, the Fourier transform \\( H(\\omega) \\) at \\( t = T \\) is dependent on the Laplace transform \\( F(s) \\) but not directly on any function \\( g(t) \\) that might have been applied in the Laplace domain, assuming \\( g(t) \\) does not affect \\( f(t) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
