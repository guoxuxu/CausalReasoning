This means that the initial condition becomes \\( u_0 + \\alpha e^{-\\beta \\cdot 0} u_0 = u_0 + \\alpha u_0 = (1 + \\alpha)u_0 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\).\n\n3. **Evolution Under Heat Equation**: The modified initial condition \\( (1 + \\alpha)u_0 \\) evolves according to the heat equation \\( u_t = \\kappa \\nabla^2 u \\). Let's denote this solution as \\( u_1(t) \\).\n\n4. **Direct Evolution Without Source**: If no source function were applied, the initial condition would remain \\( u_0 \\) and it would evolve according to the same heat equation. Let's denote this solution as \\( u_2(t) \\).\n\n5. **Comparison at Time T**: To determine if \\( u_1(T) \\) is the same as \\( u_2(T) \\), we need to consider the effect of the source term \\( \\alpha e^{-\\beta t} u \\) on the temperature distribution.\n\n6. **Source Term Effect**: The source term \\( \\alpha e^{-\\beta t} u \\) introduces a non-homogeneous term into the heat equation. This term modifies the temperature distribution over time. Specifically, it adds a term that depends on the current temperature distribution and decays exponentially with time.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Since the presence of the source term \\( \\alpha e^{-\\beta t} u \\) changes the initial condition and introduces a time-dependent modification to the temperature distribution, the temperature distribution \\( u_1(t) \\) at time \\( T \\) will not be the same as \\( u_2(t) \\) at time \\( T \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Condition and Source Function**: The initial temperature distribution is \\(u_0\\). A thermal source function \\(f(u) = \\alpha e^{-\\beta t} u\\) is applied at \\(t = 0\\).\n\n2. **Heat Equation with Source**: The modified heat equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   u_t = \\kappa \\nabla^2 u + \\alpha e^{-\\beta t} u\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Evolution Without Source**: If there were no source term, the temperature distribution would evolve according to:\n   \\[\n   u_t = \\kappa \\nabla^2 u\n   \\]\n   This describes how the temperature would change due to heat diffusion alone.\n\n4. **Comparison at Time \\(T\\)**: To determine if the temperature distribution \\(u(T)\\) at time \\(T\\) is the same when the source is applied compared to when it is not, we need to consider the effect of the source term over time.\n\n5. **Effect of Source Term**: The source term \\(\\alpha e^{-\\beta t} u\\) adds an additional heating effect that depends on both the current temperature and time. As \\(t\\) increases, the source term decreases exponentially because of the factor \\(e^{-\\beta t}\\).\n\n6. **Long-Term Behavior**: Over a long period \\(T\\), the exponential term \\(e^{-\\beta t}\\) approaches zero. Thus, for large \\(T\\), the effect of the source term diminishes, and the temperature distribution \\(u(T)\\) would approach the solution of the original heat equation without the source term.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: While the presence of the source term initially changes the temperature distribution, as time progresses, the effect of the source term diminishes, and the temperature distribution converges to the solution of the heat equation without the source term.\n\nTherefore, the temperature distribution \\(u(T)\\) at time \\(T\\) will not be exactly the same as if \\(u_0\\) was directly evolved to \\(T\\) under \\(u_t = \\kappa \\nabla^2 u\\), but it will approach that solution as \\(T\\) becomes very large.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}"
