This means that the matrix exponential \\( e^{At} \\) is being transformed by the matrix \\( M \\) and its inverse \\( M^{-1} \\). This transformation does not change the eigenvalues of \\( e^{At} \\); it only changes the basis in which these eigenvalues are expressed.\n\n### Step 2: Integral Analysis\nConsider the integral \\( \\int_0^T T_M(t) dt \\):\n\\[ \\int_0^T T_M(t) dt = \\int_0^T Me^{At}M^{-1} dt \\]\n\n### Step 3: Applying a Linear Operator \\( L \\)\nSuppose \\( L \\) is a linear operator.
