    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Given System Dynamics**: The system is described by \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}x(t) \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant and \\( x(t) \\) satisfies \\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\). Here, \\( D \\) is a constant matrix, implying that \\( x(t) \\) is a solution to a linear differential equation.\n\n2. **Laplace Transform Application**: We need to apply the Laplace Transform to \\( z(t) \\). The Laplace Transform of a function \\( f(t) \\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\} = F(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} f(t)e^{-st} dt\n   \\]\n\n3. **Transforming \\( z(t) \\)**: Applying the Laplace Transform to \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}x(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} = \\mathcal{L}\\{e^{i\\omega t}x(t)\\}\n   \\]\n   Using the property of the Laplace Transform for multiplication by an exponential, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{e^{i\\omega t}x(t)\\} = X(s - i\\omega)\n   \\]\n   where \\( X(s) \\) is the Laplace Transform of \\( x(t) \\).\n\n4. **Direct Laplace Transform of \\( x(t) \\)**: If we take the Laplace Transform of \\( x(t) \\) and then multiply by \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\), we would get:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{x(t)\\} \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\n   \\]\n   However, the correct form after applying the Laplace Transform should be \\( X(s - i\\omega) \\), not \\( X(s) \\cdot e^{i\\omega t} \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The Laplace transform of \\( z(t) \\) is indeed \\( X(s - i\\omega) \\), which is not equivalent to \\( X(s) \\cdot e^{i\\omega t} \\). Therefore, the statement \"the Laplace transform of \\( z(t) \\) is equivalent to directly taking the Laplace transform of \\( x(t) \\) multiplied by \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\)\" is incorrect.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
