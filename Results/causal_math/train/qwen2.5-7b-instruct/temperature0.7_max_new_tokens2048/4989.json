However, the Fourier Transform itself does not inherently introduce time evolution; it transforms the spatial domain into the frequency domain.\n\n4. **Time Evolution Consideration**: For \\( g(x) \\) to evolve over time, there must be some additional dynamics (like a time-dependent Hamiltonian in quantum mechanics or some other time-varying process in classical systems) that would change \\( g(x) \\) from \\( e^{ax}f(x) \\) to something else. Without such an explicit time evolution operator, \\( g(x) \\) remains \\( e^{ax}f(x) \\) for all times.\n\n5. **Comparison at Later Time T**: If no explicit time evolution operator is applied, then at any later time \\( T \\), \\( g(x) \\) still remains \\( e^{ax}f(x) \\).

Specifically, the Fourier Transform of \\( e^{ax}f(x) \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}\\{e^{ax}f(x)\\}(k) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{ax} f(x) e^{-ikx} dx\n   \\]\n   This can be rewritten using the shifting property of the Fourier Transform, which states that multiplying by \\( e^{ax} \\) corresponds to a shift in the frequency domain:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}\\{e^{ax}f(x)\\}(k) = F(k - a)\n   \\]\n   where \\( F(k) \\) is the Fourier Transform of \\( f(x) \\).\n\n4. **Evolution Over Time**: If we consider the system evolving over time \\( T \\), the Fourier Transform of the function at time \\( T \\) would generally depend on how the function evolves.
