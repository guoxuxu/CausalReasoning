This is a singularity.\n\n2. **Path of Integration**: Consider a path \\( \\gamma \\) from \\( z_0 \\) to \\( z_T \\) in the complex plane. If this path encircles the singularity \\( z = c \\), it means the path \\( \\gamma \\) goes around the point \\( z = c \\).\n\n3. **Effect of Encircling on \\( g(z) \\)**: When the path encircles \\( z = c \\), the function \\( g(z) \\) contributes a non-zero value to the integral due to the residue theorem.
