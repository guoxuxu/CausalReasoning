If this transformation is applied, the resulting vector is \\(Mx_0 + c\\). However, since we don't know whether the transformation was applied, we need to consider both possibilities: either the vector remains \\(x_0\\) or it becomes \\(Mx_0 + c\\).\n\n2. **Observing \\(x(T)\\)**: At time \\(T\\), we observe the vector \\(x(T)\\).
