The Fourier transform of \\( V(t) \\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{V}(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} V(t) e^{-st} dt\n   \\]\n   This transformation changes the representation from the time domain to the frequency domain.\n\n3. **Transformation Function**: The function \\( f(V) = e^{st}V \\) is applied to the voltage. This can be seen as a pre-processing step before taking the Fourier transform, essentially shifting the signal in the time domain before transforming it.\n\n4. **Implication on Current**: The impedance matrix \\( Z \\) remains a function of \\( s \\) (complex frequency), and the relationship \\( V = ZI \\) still holds after applying the Fourier transform.

However, once the Fourier transform is taken and the relationship \\( \\hat{V}(s) = Z(s) \\hat{I}(s) \\) is established, the impedance matrix \\( Z \\) remains unchanged.
