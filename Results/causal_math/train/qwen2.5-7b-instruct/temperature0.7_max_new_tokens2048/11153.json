    "To determine if the inverse Laplace transform of \\( F(s) \\) returns the original function \\( f(z) \\), let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the given function and transformation:**\n   - The original function is \\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\).\n   - The Laplace transform of \\( f(t) \\) (where \\( t \\) is a real variable) is \\( F(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\).\n\n2. **Apply the Laplace transform:**\n   - Since we are dealing with a complex function \\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\), we need to consider the Laplace transform in terms of a real variable \\( t \\) for practical purposes. Let's assume \\( f(t) = e^{At} \\) where \\( t \\) is real.\n   - The Laplace transform of \\( e^{At} \\) is \\( F(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} e^{At} dt = \\int_0^\\infty e^{(A-s)t} dt \\).\n\n3. **Evaluate the integral:**\n   - For \\( s > \\text{Re}(A) \\), the integral converges and can be evaluated as:\n     \\[\n     F(s) = \\left[ \\frac{e^{(A-s)t}}{A-s} \\right]_0^\\infty = \\frac{1}{s-A}\n     \\]\n   - Here, \\( s \\) must be such that \\( \\text{Re}(s) > \\text{Re}(A) \\) for the integral to converge.\n\n4. **Consider the inverse Laplace transform:**\n   - The inverse Laplace transform of \\( F(s) = \\frac{1}{s-A} \\) is known to be \\( e^{At} \\) for \\( t \\geq 0 \\).\n   - However, the original function \\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\) is defined in the complex plane, not just on the real axis.\n\n5. **Compare the original and transformed functions:**\n   - The Laplace transform \\( F(s) \\) is derived assuming \\( t \\) is real, while \\( f(z) \\) is defined for all complex \\( z \\).\n   - The inverse Laplace transform correctly recovers the function \\( e^{At} \\) for real \\( t \\), but it does not directly apply to the complex function \\( e^{Az} \\) without further consideration.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - While the inverse Laplace transform correctly recovers the real part of the function for real \\( t \\), it does not directly return the original complex function \\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\) because the Laplace transform and its inverse are typically defined for real variables.\n\nGiven the above reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
