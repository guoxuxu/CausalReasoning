This form suggests that \\( z(t) \\) is a solution to a linear differential equation of the form \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = Az \\).\n\n2. **Interventions**: The question mentions \"transformations (either \\( h(x) \\) or \\( k(x) \\), or both)\" which could imply changes to the input vector \\( x \\) or some other aspect of the system.
