    "To answer this question, let's break down the problem into steps:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: We have a function \\(z(t)\\) defined as a convolution of two functions, \\(F(t,s)\\) and \\(g(s)\\). The goal is to determine if, based solely on observing \\(z(t)\\) at certain time points, we can distinguish between two possible initial functions, \\(g(s)\\) and \\(h(s)\\).\n\n2. **Convolution Property**: The expression for \\(z(t)\\) can be seen as a convolution of \\(F(t,s)\\) and \\(g(s)\\):\n   \\[\n   z(t) = (F(t, \\cdot) * g)(t)\n   \\]\n   where \\(*\\) denotes convolution. Similarly, if \\(h(s)\\) were the initial function, then:\n   \\[\n   z'(t) = (F(t, \\cdot) * h)(t)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Uniqueness of Inverse Problem**: The inverse problem of determining the initial function from the observed convolution result is generally not unique. There could be multiple functions that, when convolved with \\(F(t, s)\\), yield the same result.\n\n4. **Fourier Transform Insight**: Using Fourier transforms, the convolution theorem states that the Fourier transform of a convolution is the product of the Fourier transforms of the individual functions. If \\(\\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\}\\) (the Fourier transform of \\(z(t)\\)) is known, we would need additional information about \\(F(t, s)\\) to uniquely determine \\(g(s)\\) or \\(h(s)\\).\n\n5. **Observation at Specific Points**: Observing \\(z(t)\\) at specific time points does not provide enough information to uniquely identify \\(g(s)\\) or \\(h(s)\\) without further constraints or additional data. The values of \\(z(t)\\) at different points only give us a series of linear equations involving the convolution, but these equations are underdetermined without more information.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Given that the convolution operation is non-invertible without additional constraints or information about the kernel \\(F(t, s)\\), and that observing \\(z(t)\\) at specific points does not provide sufficient information to distinguish between \\(g(s)\\) and \\(h(s)\\), we cannot uniquely determine which function was initialized based solely on \\(z(t)\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step-by-step:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: We have a function \\( z(t) \\) defined as:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} F(t, s) g(s) \\, ds\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( F(t, s) \\) is the kernel function and \\( g(s) \\) is the initial function.\n\n2. **Alternative Initial Function**: We are considering another function \\( h(s) \\) that could also lead to a possible solution for \\( z(t) \\). Thus, we have:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} F(t, s) h(s) \\, ds\n   \\]\n\n3. **Uniqueness of \\( g(s) \\)**: The key question is whether \\( z(t) \\) alone, observed at a set of time points, can uniquely determine \\( g(s) \\) or \\( h(s) \\).\n\n4. **Inverse Problem**: The problem essentially asks about the uniqueness of the inverse problem where the goal is to recover \\( g(s) \\) from \\( z(t) \\).\n\n5. **Mathematical Context**: This type of problem often relates to the theory of integral equations and the uniqueness of solutions to such equations. Specifically, it involves the Fredholm integral equation of the first kind, which is known to be generally ill-posed due to its non-uniqueness and instability.\n\n6. **Kernel and Solutions**: If the kernel \\( F(t, s) \\) is not injective (i.e., there exist different functions \\( g(s) \\) and \\( h(s) \\) that produce the same \\( z(t) \\)), then \\( z(t) \\) cannot uniquely determine \\( g(s) \\).\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Given that the problem does not specify any additional constraints or properties of \\( F(t, s) \\) that would ensure the uniqueness of \\( g(s) \\), we must conclude that \\( z(t) \\) alone, without further information, cannot uniquely determine which of \\( g(s) \\) or \\( h(s) \\) was initialized.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
