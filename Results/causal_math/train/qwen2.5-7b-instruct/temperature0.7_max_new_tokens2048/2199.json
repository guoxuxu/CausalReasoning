    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Signal Processing**: \n   - We start with a signal \\( s(t) \\).\n   - This signal is first convolved with the impulse response \\( h(t) \\) of the LTI system. Mathematically, this is represented as \\( y_1(t) = s(t) * h(t) \\), where \\( * \\) denotes convolution.\n   - Next, the result \\( y_1(t) \\) undergoes a Fourier Transform, resulting in \\( Y_1(f) \\).\n\n2. **Intervention with Another Filter**:\n   - An additional filter with impulse response \\( g(t) \\) is applied to \\( y_1(t) \\). This means we convolve \\( y_1(t) \\) with \\( g(t) \\), leading to \\( y_2(t) = y_1(t) * g(t) \\).\n   - Finally, \\( y_2(t) \\) undergoes a Fourier Transform, resulting in \\( Y_2(f) \\).\n\n3. **Effect on the Fourier Transform**:\n   - The key property of the Fourier Transform in the context of convolution is that convolution in the time domain corresponds to multiplication in the frequency domain.\n   - Therefore, the Fourier Transform of \\( y_1(t) \\) is \\( Y_1(f) = S(f)H(f) \\), where \\( S(f) \\) is the Fourier Transform of \\( s(t) \\) and \\( H(f) \\) is the Fourier Transform of \\( h(t) \\).\n   - When we apply the additional filter with impulse response \\( g(t) \\), the new output in the time domain is \\( y_2(t) = y_1(t) * g(t) \\).

However, since the question asks specifically about the dependency on \\( h(t) \\) and \\( g(t) \\), we can conclude that the Fourier Transform of the final output does depend on both \\( h(t) \\) and \\( g(t) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
