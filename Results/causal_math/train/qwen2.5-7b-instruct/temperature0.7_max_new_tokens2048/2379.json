It only modifies the initial condition or boundary conditions of the problem.\n\n3. **Introduction of \\( q(p) \\)**: At time \\( t_1 \\), a new function \\( q(p) = e^{-mt} p \\) is introduced. This introduces a second exponential decay term, which again scales the pressure but now with a different constant \\( m \\).\n\n4. **Effect of Transformations**: Both transformations \\( h(p) \\) and \\( q(p) \\) introduce additional factors that scale the pressure over time. However, these factors do not alter the fundamental diffusion process described by the PDE. They merely modify the initial state or the state at specific times.\n\n5. **Final State Analysis**: To understand the state of \\( p(x, T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\), we need to consider the combined effect of the original PDE and the transformations. The solution to the PDE with the initial condition modified by \\( h(p) \\) and then further modified by \\( q(p) \\) will still be governed by the same diffusion process, but the initial condition will include the effects of both \\( h(p) \\) and \\( q(p) \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The diffusion process itself, which is governed by \\( D \\), remains unchanged. The constants \\( k \\) and \\( m \\) only affect the initial conditions and the state of the system at specific times, but they do not alter the long-term behavior of the system as described by the diffusion coefficient \\( D \\).\n\nTherefore, the outcome \\( p(x, T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) will depend on \\( D \\) and will not depend on \\( k \\) or \\( m \\) in the long run, as the diffusion process continues to dominate.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
