    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Operators**:\n   - \\( M(t^n) \\): This represents multiplication by \\( t^n \\). So, if we apply \\( M \\) to a function \\( f(t) \\), we get \\( t^n f(t) \\).\n   - \\( L \\): This represents differentiation with respect to \\( t \\).\n\n2. **Applying the Laplace Transform**:\n   - The Laplace transform of \\( t^n \\) is given by: \n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{L}(t^n) = \\frac{n!}{s^{n+1}}\n     \\]\n   - If we first apply \\( M \\) to \\( t^n \\), then we get \\( t^n \\cdot t^n = t^{2n} \\). Applying the Laplace transform to \\( t^{2n} \\):\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{L}(t^{2n}) = \\frac{(2n)!}{s^{2n+1}}\n     \\]\n   - If we first apply \\( L \\) to \\( t^n \\), we differentiate \\( t^n \\) with respect to \\( t \\):\n     \\[\n     L(t^n) = \\frac{d}{dt}(t^n) = n t^{n-1}\n     \\]\n     Then applying the Laplace transform to \\( n t^{n-1} \\):\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{L}(n t^{n-1}) = n \\mathcal{L}(t^{n-1}) = n \\frac{(n-1)!}{s^n} = \\frac{n!}{s^n}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Comparing the Results**:\n   - From the above calculations, we see that the Laplace transform of \\( t^{2n} \\) (after applying \\( M \\) first) results in \\( \\frac{(2n)!}{s^{2n+1}} \\).\n   - The Laplace transform of \\( n t^{n-1} \\) (after applying \\( L \\) first) results in \\( \\frac{n!}{s^n} \\).\n\n4. **Uniqueness of Determination**:\n   - The results from the Laplace transform after applying \\( M \\) and \\( L \\) are distinctly different. Specifically, the exponents and coefficients in the transformed expressions are unique to each case.\n   - Therefore, given the Laplace transform result, we can uniquely determine whether the operator \\( M \\) or \\( L \\) was applied to the original function before transformation.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
