This means that small errors in the data can lead to large errors in the solution, and there may be multiple possible initial conditions that could have led to the observed final state.\n\n6. **Lack of Information on Transformation**: Even if the Fourier transform was applied initially, without knowing this fact and without additional information (like boundary conditions or other measurements), the exact initial condition cannot be determined uniquely from the final state alone.\n\nTherefore, based on the above reasoning, we conclude that we cannot determine the exact initial temperature distribution \\( u(x, 0) \\) from the observed temperature distribution \\( u(x, T) \\) at \\( t = T \\), without knowing whether Fourier transform was initially applied.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
