This gives us \\( I[h] = \\int_{\\gamma} \\frac{1}{z} \\, dz \\).\n\n2. **Effect of Transformation by \\( g(z) \\)**: The problem mentions applying \\( g(z) \\) to \\( h(z) \\), resulting in \\( h'(z) = g(z) + h(z) \\). The integral of this transformed function is \\( I[h'] = \\int_{\\gamma} (g(z) + \\frac{1}{z}) \\, dz \\).\n\n3. **Integral Calculation**: The integral \\( I[h] \\) for \\( h(z) = \\frac{1}{z} \\) along a closed contour that encloses the origin is known to be \\( 2\\pi i \\) due to the residue theorem. If \\( g(z) \\) is analytic everywhere inside and on the contour \\( \\gamma \\), then by Cauchy's integral theorem, \\( \\int_{\\gamma} g(z) \\, dz = 0 \\).
