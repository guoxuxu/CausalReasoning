Instead, it scales the real part by \\( \\alpha \\) and the imaginary part by \\( \\beta \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Changes in \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\beta \\) do not linearly reflect in \\( Z(s) \\) in the same manner because \\( Z(s) \\) is a complex function combining both \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) terms.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "To reason through this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand the given function and its Laplace Transform**:\n   - The function \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\) is a complex function where \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) are real functions of time \\( t \\).\n   - The Laplace Transform of \\( z(t) \\) is \\( Z(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t) + iv(t)\\}(s) \\).\n\n2. **Effect of coefficients \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\beta \\)**:\n   - The Laplace Transform of \\( \\alpha u(t) + \\beta v(t) \\) can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     Z(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{\\alpha u(t) + \\beta v(t)\\}(s)\n     \\]\n   - Using linearity property of the Laplace Transform:\n     \\[\n     Z(s) = \\alpha \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\}(s) + \\beta \\mathcal{L}\\{v(t)\\}(s)\n     \\]\n   - Let \\( U(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\}(s) \\) and \\( V(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{v(t)\\}(s) \\). Then,\n     \\[\n     Z(s) = \\alpha U(s) + \\beta V(s)\n     \\]\n\n3. **Adjusting coefficients at \\( t = 0 \\)**:\n   - If \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\beta \\) are adjusted at \\( t = 0 \\), the Laplace Transforms of \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) (i.e., \\( U(s) \\) and \\( V(s) \\)) remain unchanged because the Laplace Transform is defined as an integral from \\( t = 0 \\) to \\( t = \\infty \\).\n\n4. **Linear relationship between \\( Z(s) \\) and \\( \\alpha \\) & \\( \\beta \\)**:\n   - Since \\( U(s) \\) and \\( V(s) \\) are constants (they do not change with adjustments to \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\beta \\)), the relationship \\( Z(s) = \\alpha U(s) + \\beta V(s) \\) shows that \\( Z(s) \\) will linearly reflect any changes made to \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\beta \\).\n\nGiven the above reasoning, we can conclude that changes in the Laplace Transform \\( Z(s) \\) will indeed linearly reflect changes made to the coefficients \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\beta \\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
