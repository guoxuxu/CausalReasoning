    "To determine if we can deduce the original states \\( x_0 \\) and \\( y_0 \\) from the transformed state \\( z^T(t) \\), let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Original Systems Dynamics**: The systems are described by the differential equations:\n   - \\( \\dot{x} = Ax \\)\n   - \\( \\dot{y} = By \\)\n\n2. **Integral Transform Application**: The integral transform applied to each component is:\n   - \\( T[x](t) = \\int_0^t e^{-(t-\\tau)C} x(\\tau) d\\tau \\)\n   - \\( T[y](t) = \\int_0^t e^{-(t-\\tau)C} y(\\tau) d\\tau \\)\n\n3. **Combined State Transformation**: The combined state \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) transforms to \\( z^T(t) = T[x](t) + iT[y](t) \\).\n\n4. **Invertibility of the Integral Transform**: To deduce the original states, we need to check if the integral transform \\( T \\) is invertible. For the transform to be invertible, there should exist an inverse operator \\( T^{-1} \\) such that applying \\( T \\) followed by \\( T^{-1} \\) (or vice versa) returns the original function.\n\n5. **Properties of the Integral Transform**: The integral transform given is a convolution type transform, which generally does not have a straightforward inverse without additional constraints on \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\). However, for specific forms of \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\), and under certain conditions, such as diagonalizability and appropriate choice of \\( C \\), the transform might be invertible.\n\n6. **Recovery of Original States**: If the transform is invertible, then theoretically, we could recover the original states \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) from \\( z^T(t) \\). This would imply that we could also find \\( x_0 \\) and \\( y_0 \\) at \\( t=0 \\).\n\nGiven the complexity and the need for specific conditions for invertibility, and without loss of generality, we assume that under suitable conditions (e.g., diagonalizability and proper choice of matrices), the transform can indeed be inverted.\n\nTherefore, under these conditions, it is possible to deduce the original states \\( x_0 \\) and \\( y_0 \\) at \\( t=0 \\) from \\( z^T(t) \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
