  "Problem": "def temperature_adjustment(sensor_data): \n  temp = sensor_data['temperature'] \n  humidity = sensor_data['humidity'] \n  if humidity > 50: \n    adjustment = 0.1 * (humidity - 50) \n  else:  \n    adjustment = 0 \n  adjusted_temp = temp - adjustment \n  return adjusted_temp \n \n sensor_data = {'temperature': 80, 'humidity': 60} \n print(temperature_adjustment(sensor_data))\",\n\nIf we manually modify the temperature in the sensor data to be higher, will the adjusted temperature still decrease if the humidity is increased?",
  "Explanation": "The increase in temperature by manual adjustment affects the base temperature but doesn't halt the humidity check or adjustments. Thus, if humidity increases beyond 50, adjustments occur and reduce the new adjusted temperature despite the manually increased base temperature.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "humidity > 50 → adjustment > 0; humidity → adjustment; adjustment > 0 → adjusted_temp < temp",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "If humidity is greater than 50, an adjustment is made which leads to a decrease in the adjusted temperature. An increase in humidity can result in a positive adjustment, reducing the original temperature. Therefore, increasing humidity while the temperature is high may lead to a decrease in the adjusted temperature."
