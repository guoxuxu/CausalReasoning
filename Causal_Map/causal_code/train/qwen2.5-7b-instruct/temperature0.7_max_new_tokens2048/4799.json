  "Explanation": "Intervening to always return 'active' removes the dependency of the output on the input state ('user_login'). Thus, regardless of the user's actual login state, the user state would always be set to 'active'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
