  "Explanation": "The remove_stock method returns False either because the item does not exist or the existing stock is less than the quantity to remove. If the stock was greater and got reduced right before the call, remove_stock would likely have enough stock to remove and return True, unless some other external factor intervened.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
