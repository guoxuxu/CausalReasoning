  "Explanation": "This question tests causal inference from effect (message to close the window) to cause (weather and window state) with an intervention. The intervention disassociates the relationship between the weather and window's status by standardizing the output message irrespective of actual conditions. Hence, the display message is no longer indicative of the actual weather state or the window’s status.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The weather conditions directly influence whether the window is open, which in turn determines the message logged. However, the proposed intervention does not establish causality but rather ensures a specific message is displayed irrespective of the actual weather."
