  "Explanation": "Based on the code, what matters for growth is that the plant’s ‘watered’ and ‘exposed_to_sunlight’ attributes are each true at the time of calling the grow method. How 'watered' is set to true (whether through method or manual intervention) doesn’t change the outcome in this context.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
