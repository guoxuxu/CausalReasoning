  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, quantity, discount_rate=0.1, tax_rate=0.2):\n    discount = price * quantity * discount_rate\n    tax = (price * quantity - discount) * tax_rate\n    total_sales = (price * quantity - discount) + tax\n    return total_sales\",\n\nIf we intervene and set the tax rate to zero, does observing no change in total sales necessarily imply that the price and quantity remained constant?",
  "Explanation": "Setting the tax rate to zero simplifies the sales calculation to just the base sales minus any discounts. Thus, even if the base sales increase due to increased price or quantity, if there is a corresponding increase in the discount rate (or an effective use of discounting), it could offset the increase from price or quantity, resulting in no change in total sales. Therefore, stable total sales do not necessarily imply unchanged price and quantity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
