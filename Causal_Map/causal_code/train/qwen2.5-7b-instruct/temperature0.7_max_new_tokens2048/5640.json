  "Explanation": "final_sales is influenced by both the initial_sales and the operations in apply_discount and advertising_impact. Since these later functions introduce changes and conditions, final_sales alone is insufficient to accurately deduce initial_sales without additional data about the discount rate or the effects of advertising.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial sales are generated by the generate_sales function, which then influences the discounted sales through the apply_discount function, and finally, the final sales are determined by the advertising_impact function based on the discounted sales."
