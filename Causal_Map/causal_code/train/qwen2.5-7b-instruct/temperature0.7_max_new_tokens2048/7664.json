  "Problem": "def compute_health_index(age, smoking_status, exercise_freq, diet_quality):\n    base_health = 100\n    age_penalty = age * 0.5\n    smoke_penalty = 20 if smoking_status else 0\n    exercise_bonus = 10 * exercise_freq\n    diet_bonus = 5 * diet_quality\n    health_index = base_health - age_penalty + exercise_bonus + diet_bonus - smoke_penalty\n    return health_index\",\n\nIf a health improvement program results in an increased health index, can we conclude that the diet quality has improved?",
  "Explanation": "An increase in the health index could result from different interventions besides just improvements in diet quality, such as increases in exercise frequency, reductions in smoking rate, or even varying impacts of age. An exclusive conclusion about the change in diet quality cannot be made without isolating other contributing factors.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
