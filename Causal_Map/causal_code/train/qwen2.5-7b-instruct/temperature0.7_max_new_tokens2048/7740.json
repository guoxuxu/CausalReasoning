  "Problem": "class Store {\n  int customers;\n  double price;\n  boolean promotion;\n\n  double calcSales() {\n    if (promotion) {\n      price *= 0.8;\n    }\n    return customers * price;\n  }\n\n  void setPromotion(boolean status) {\n    promotion = status;\n  }\n\n  void adjustPrice(double newPrice) {\n    if (newPrice > price) {\n      price = newPrice;\n    }\n  }\n}\",\n\nIf sales increase significantly, can we conclude a promotion was successfully implemented?",
  "Explanation": "Significant increases in sales could be due to a variety of factors such as promotions, an increase in the number of customers, or raising prices effectively before the promotion was set. The presence of a promotion might contribute to the increase but is not necessarily the sole cause.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
