  "Explanation": "While lowering the threshold could cause more anomalies to be detected, detecting more anomalies doesn't necessarily indicate that the threshold was lowered. Increases in data variability or other factors might also result in more detected anomalies.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If more indices are detected in the anomalies list, it indicates that the anomaly threshold was potentially lowered, as a higher number of detected anomalies suggests a more sensitive detection criterion."
