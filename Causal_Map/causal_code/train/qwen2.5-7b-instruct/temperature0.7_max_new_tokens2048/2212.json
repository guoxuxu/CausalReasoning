  "Problem": "def update_prices(prices, increment, should_update): \n    if should_update: \n        for i in range(len(prices)): \n            prices[i] += increment \n    return prices\",\n\nIf the prices have increased, can we conclude `should_update` was True?",
  "Explanation": "Even though the `should_update` set to True leads to increment in prices, prices could have been increased before running this function or could be raised due to other external manipulations outside of this function. Hence, we can't solely conclude `should_update` was true just by observing increased prices.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "If should_update is True, then prices will be updated by increment. The state of prices directly indicates whether should_update was True during the last update."
