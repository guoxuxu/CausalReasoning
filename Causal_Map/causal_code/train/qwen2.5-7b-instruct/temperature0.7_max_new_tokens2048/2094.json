  "Explanation": "The `adjust_humidity` function modifies the humidity by multiplying the new value by 0.9 if the temperature is above 20. Therefore, if humidity is less than expected after this method is called with the temperature over 20, it implies that the method functioned as designed by adjusting the humidity to 90% of the input value.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "If the temperature is greater than 20, increasing humidity to a new level results in a 90% application of that new level. If the temperature is 20 or lower, the humidity is set to the new level. If the temperature drops below 15, the humidity increases by 5."
