  "Problem": "def calculate_health_condition(age, smoker, activity_level):\n    risk_factor = 2 if smoker else 1\n    if age > 50:\n        risk_factor *= 1.5\n    if activity_level == 'low':\n        risk_factor *= 1.2\n    elif activity_level == 'high':\n        risk_factor *= 0.8\n    return 'high-risk' if risk_factor > 2.5 else 'low-risk'\",\n\nIf we intervene and change a smoker's status to non-smoker, while keeping other factors constant, would that transition their health condition from 'high-risk' to 'low-risk'?",
  "Explanation": "Changing a smoker's status to non-smoker decreases the risk factor (from 2 to 1). This change, assuming the other factors do not push the risk factor above 2.5, generally leads to a lower total risk and likely transitions their health condition from 'high-risk' to 'low-risk'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Smoking status, age, and activity level directly influence risk factor, which in turn determines the health condition. Changing smoking status can alter the risk factor, potentially changing the health condition from high-risk to low-risk."
