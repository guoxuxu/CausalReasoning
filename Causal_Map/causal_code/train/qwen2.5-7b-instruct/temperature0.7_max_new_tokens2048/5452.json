  "Explanation": "From effect to cause without intervention: Higher revenue might result not only from an increase in `unitsSold` but also from either an increase in `salePrice` or a decrease in `discountRate`. Multiple factors influencing revenue makes it incorrect to infer the increase in units sold directly from the increase in revenue alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
