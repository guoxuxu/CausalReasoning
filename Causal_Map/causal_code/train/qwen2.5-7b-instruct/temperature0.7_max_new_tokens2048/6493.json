  "Explanation": "When the temperature is set to 22 degrees (a value not exceeding 25) and raining is set to false, the getWeatherStatus method will return 'Cloudy' because the conditions for 'Rainy' (raining) and 'Sunny' (temperature > 25) do not meet.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The weather status is determined by whether it is raining and the temperature. If it is raining, the weather status is 'Rainy'. If the temperature is greater than 25, the weather status is 'Sunny'. Otherwise, the weather status is 'Cloudy'. Setting the temperature to 22 degrees and enforcing non-raining status does not necessarily result in 'Cloudy' weather status because if the temperature were greater than 25, the weather would be 'Sunny' instead."
