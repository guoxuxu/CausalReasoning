  "Explanation": "Per the code, any update to 'sunny' weather increases the temperature by 5. Thus, starting from an intervened temperature of 20 degrees, updating the weather to 'sunny' would result in a new temperature of 25 degrees. This increase is consistent and follows irrespective of the previous temperature, provided no additional logic modifies this behavior.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
