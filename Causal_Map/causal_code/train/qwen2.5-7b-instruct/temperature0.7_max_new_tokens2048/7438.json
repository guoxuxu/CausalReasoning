  "Problem": "Room class with methods to adjust temperature based on heater and window states.\",\n\nIf the room temperature increased, can we conclude that the heater was turned on without considering any other possible interventions?",
  "Explanation": "The temperature could have increased either because the heater was turned on or because the windows were closed if they were previously open. Thus, without additional context, one cannot conclusively determine the cause.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
