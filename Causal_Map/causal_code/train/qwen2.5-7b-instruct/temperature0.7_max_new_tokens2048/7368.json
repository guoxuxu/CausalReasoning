  "Explanation": "The reduction in 'calculateFinalPrice()' following 'setPromotion(true)' does not necessarily indicate that the original price was higher; it primarily reflects the discount application due to the promotion. The original price remains the same but appears reduced in the final calculation due to the discount.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
