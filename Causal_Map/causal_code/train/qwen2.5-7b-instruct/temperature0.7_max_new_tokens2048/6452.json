  "Explanation": "The reception of an additional 30 units of stock is predefined to occur after the order shipment and does not vary depending on whether the first order was successful or not. This tests the understanding of a relationship where order status does not retroactively affect the decision to receive more stock.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
