  "Explanation": "Adjusting John's salary manually (via an external intervention like `john.salary += 5000`) does not affect his performance rating in the code. The `updateSalary` function does not influence performance ratings; it purely changes the salary field.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
