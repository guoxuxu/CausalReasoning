  "Explanation": "High temperature alone does not guarantee 'Rain'; high humidity above 70% is also required. If the humidity is not above 70%, the prediction could be 'Cloudy'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
