  "Explanation": "isColdOutside() checks if the temperature is below 20 degrees. Setting temperature to 15 ensures that the condition for isColdOutside() being true is met.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
