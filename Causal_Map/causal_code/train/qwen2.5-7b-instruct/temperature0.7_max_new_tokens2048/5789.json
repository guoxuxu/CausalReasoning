  "Problem": "def resolve_issue(customer_satisfaction, response_time, agent_expertise):\n    if agent_expertise >= 8:\n        customer_satisfaction *= 1.1\n    else:\n        customer_satisfaction *= 0.9\n    if response_time < 5:\n        customer_satisfaction *= 1.2\n    elif response_time > 10:\n        customer_satisfaction *= 0.8\n    resolution_success = customer_satisfaction > 85\n    return resolution_success\",\n\nIf we manually increase an agent's expertise to 9 during a slow response time scenario, will this intervention likely result in a higher rate of resolution success?",
  "Explanation": "Raising the agent's expertise moderates the negative impact of a slow response time by boosting the customer satisfaction, consequently elevating the odds of a successful resolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in agent expertise leads to higher customer satisfaction, which in turn increases the likelihood of resolution success. A slower response time decreases customer satisfaction, reducing the likelihood of resolution success unless expertise is high enough to compensate."
