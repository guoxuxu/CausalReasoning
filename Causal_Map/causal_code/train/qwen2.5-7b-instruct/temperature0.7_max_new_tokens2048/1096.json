  "Explanation": "The code specifies that if the temperature is above 25 degrees, the air conditioning turns on and reduces the temperature by 5 degrees. Therefore, observing a decrease in temperature when it's above 25 degrees suggests that the air conditioning has likely turned on.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
