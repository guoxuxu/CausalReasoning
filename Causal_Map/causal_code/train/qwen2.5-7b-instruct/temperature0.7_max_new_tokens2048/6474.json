  "Explanation": "Even if we intervene and change the order of conditions in 'willPlantsSurvive()', the method's reasoning is still based on both 'isRaining' and temperature. Observing the plants' death can indicate it's either not raining, or it is too hot, or both. Thus, solely from plant death, we cannot discern that high temperature was the specific cause without additional information on the raining condition.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map_integration": "The weather conditions (whether it is raining and the temperature) directly influence whether plants will survive. Specifically, if it is not raining and the temperature is above 30, plants will not survive; otherwise, they will."
