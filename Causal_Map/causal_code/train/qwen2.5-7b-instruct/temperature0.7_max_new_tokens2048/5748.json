  "Problem": "def process_data(data, flag): \n    if flag: \n        result = data * 2 \n    else: \n        result = data + 100 \n    return result \n\ndef final_result(data_point, action_flag): \n    intermediate = process_data(data_point, action_flag) \n    if intermediate > 150: \n        output = 'High' \n    else: \n        output = 'Low' \n    return output\",\n\nIf the 'output' from the function 'final_result' is 'High', can we ascertain that the 'action_flag' was set to True?",
  "Explanation": "A 'High' output indicates that 'intermediate > 150'. This could occur both when 'action_flag' is True (resulting in multiplication) and when it is False (resulting in addition by 100), as long as the 'data_point' is sufficiently high to push 'intermediate' over 150. Thus, a 'High' output alone does not definitively indicate the state of 'action_flag'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "If 'action_flag' is True, 'result' is twice 'data_point'. If 'action_flag' is False, 'result' is 'data_point' plus 100. 'result' greater than 150 leads to 'output' being 'High'. Therefore, 'output' being 'High' suggests 'result' is likely greater than 150, which can occur if 'action_flag' is True (when 'result' is twice 'data_point') but also if 'data_point' is sufficiently large when 'action_flag' is False."
