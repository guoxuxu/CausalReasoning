  "Problem": "def compute_sales_data(prices, discounts, tax_rate):\n    final_prices = [(p - p * d) for p, d in zip(prices, discounts)]\n    tax_amounts = [fp * tax_rate for fp in final_prices]\n    total_sales = sum([fp + ta for fp, ta in zip(final_prices, tax_amounts)])\n    return total_sales\",\n\nObserving an increase in total sales, does that necessarily mean there was a decrease in the applied discounts, assuming no other factors changed?",
  "Explanation": "An increase in total sales could be influenced by several factors aside from a decrease in discounts; it could result from higher initial prices, a lower tax rate, or even a change in the quantity or types of items sold. Hence, without additional information, one cannot conclusively infer the cause of the increased sales merely from the observed effect.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in total sales does not necessarily mean a decrease in applied discounts, as it can also be influenced by changes in final prices (which are affected by both prices and discounts) and tax amounts."
