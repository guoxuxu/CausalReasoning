  "Explanation": "According to the code, if the year is beyond 2020, the sales figure is multiplied by 1.1, which means it increases by 10%. This alteration directly results from the condition checking the year.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
