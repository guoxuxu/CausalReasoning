  "Explanation": "Turning the heater off does not directly control the temperature; it only stops increasing the `current_temp`. External factors can still affect the temperature, and hence `current_temp` might not necessarily reach or exceed the `desired_temp`. Moreover, setting `heater_on` to False doesn't imply that the conditions making it False (temperature equal or higher) were met—this is particularly true when done as an intervention and not as a result of the normal logic of the `update` method.",
