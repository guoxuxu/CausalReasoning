  "Explanation": "Setting the shipping cost manually without following the rules within the function does not provide any reliable information about the regular computation path of the final price; it bypasses the internal logic of how shipping cost is determined based on the final price.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

Setting data['shipping_cost'] to 0 does not directly affect data['final_price'] unless it changes the condition under which data['shipping_cost'] is calculated, but this change alone does not imply data['final_price'] is less than 100."
