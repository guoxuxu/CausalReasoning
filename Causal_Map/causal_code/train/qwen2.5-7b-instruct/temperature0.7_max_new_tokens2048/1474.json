  "Explanation": "An intervention through the 'sleep()' method adds hours to 'sleepHours' and potentially reduces 'heartRate' if sleeping hours reach or exceed 8. This reduction in heart rate can change the 'isAtRisk' status, especially if high heart rate and insufficient sleep were contributing factors. This illustrates how an effect (change in risk status) can be manipulated through a cause (more sleep).",

  "causal_map_integration": "By increasing sleepHours through the sleep() method, heartRate may decrease which can affect the isAtRisk status since heartRate is a factor in determining if a person is at risk. Additionally, directly changing the active status would also alter the isAtRisk status."
