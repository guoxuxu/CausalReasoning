  "Explanation": "The function `remove_noise` explicitly filters out negative numbers before they could affect the calculations in `analyze_data`. Therefore, even if there are negative numbers in `raw_data`, they would not be present in the data analyzed, so their presence does not directly impact the final average calculated.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If the result from `analyze_data` is lower than expected, it could be because the raw_data contains negative numbers which are removed during the cleaning process, leading to a smaller average in the filtered and analyzed data."
