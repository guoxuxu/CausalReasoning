  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(price, customer_type):\n    base_discount = 0.1 if customer_type == 'loyal' else 0\n    seasonal_discount = 0.05 if price > 100 else 0\n    total_discount = base_discount + seasonal_discount\n    discounted_price = price - (price * total_discount)\n    return discounted_price\",\n\nBy observing a lower discounted price, can we conclude the customer is 'loyal'?",
  "Explanation": "A lower discounted price can also result from a higher initial price leading to a seasonal discount, independent of the customer being 'loyal'. Therefore, observing a lower discounted price alone does not conclusively indicate that the customer is 'loyal'.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The customer type influences the base discount, and the price influences the seasonal discount. The sum of base and seasonal discounts determines the total discount, which in turn affects the discounted price."
