  "Explanation": "The code shows that if the budget is over 1000, the range of possible ad clicks increases (from a max of 50 to a max of 100). Doubling the budget would allow more ad launches at a higher budget level, thus increasing the likelihood of higher clicks per launch.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
