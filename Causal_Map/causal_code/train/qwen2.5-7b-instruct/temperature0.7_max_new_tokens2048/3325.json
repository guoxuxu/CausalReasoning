  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator {\n  int temperature;\n  boolean isRaining;\n\n  public WeatherSimulator() {\n    temperature = 20;\n    isRaining = false;\n  }\n\n  void updateWeather(int deltaTemp, boolean rain) {\n    temperature += deltaTemp;\n    if (rain) {\n      isRaining = true;\n      if (temperature < 10) {\n        temperature = 5;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  String getWeatherStatus() {\n    if (isRaining) {\n      return \"Rainy and cold\";\n    } else {\n      return \"Clear and \" + temperature + \" degrees\";\n    }\n  }\n}\",\n\nIf after an update the temperature is exactly 5 degrees and it is raining, can we conclude that rain was introduced and the temperature before updating was less than 10 degrees?",
  "Explanation": "When 'updateWeather' records that it's raining ('isRaining' being true and rain parameter being true) and sets the temperature to exactly 5 degrees, it indicates that rain was introduced when temperature was less than 10 degrees. This results in the temperature forcibly set to 5 by the method logic under rainy conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If it is raining, then the temperature is set to 5 degrees. If the temperature is less than 10 before updating, it will be adjusted to 5 degrees when it starts raining."
