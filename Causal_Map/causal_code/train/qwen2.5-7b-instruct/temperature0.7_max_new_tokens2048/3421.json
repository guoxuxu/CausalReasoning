  "Explanation": "When fertilizer is used, an additional 20 points are added to leaf health regardless of the season. Even though the season also affects health, observing an increase after using the fertilizer does not allow us to conclusively determine the season’s contribution due to confounding influence of the intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
