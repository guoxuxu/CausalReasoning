  "Explanation": "Alice already qualifies for a promotion as her current sales are 120 with 4 years of service, surpassing the condition of sales greater than 100 and years of service more than 3. Further increase in sales maintains or strengthens her eligibility for promotion.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
