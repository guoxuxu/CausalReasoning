  "Problem": "def compute_salary(base_salary, days_worked, bonus, tax_rate):\n    salary_without_tax = base_salary * days_worked / 30\n    if bonus:\n        salary_without_tax += 500\n    tax = salary_without_tax * tax_rate\n    net_salary = salary_without_tax - tax\n    return net_salary\",\n\nIf an intervention causes an increase in net_salary, does it necessarily mean the base_salary was increased?",
  "Explanation": "An increase in `net_salary` can be induced by several types of interventions besides an increase in the `base_salary`. Possible interventions include lowering the `tax_rate`, increasing the `days_worked`, or introducing a new bonus. Since multiple factors besides `base_salary` directly influence `net_salary`, an observed increase in it from an intervention does not necessarily mean that the `base_salary` was increased.",
