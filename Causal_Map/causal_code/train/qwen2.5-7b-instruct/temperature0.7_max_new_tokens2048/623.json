  "Explanation": "A high correlation indicates a relationship or association between 'sales' and 'cost', but it does not establish causality. There might be other confounding factors or the relationship could be due to coincidence or indirect effects. Therefore, correlation alone does not imply that increasing 'cost' will causally increase 'sales'.",
