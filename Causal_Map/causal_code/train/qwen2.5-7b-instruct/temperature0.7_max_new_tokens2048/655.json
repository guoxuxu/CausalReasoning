  "Explanation": "Changing 'bonus_sales' to 200 through an external intervention does not imply any causal adjustment to 'discount_factor'. The code assigns 'bonus_sales' based on 'discount_factor' conditions directly, and any external changes to 'bonus_sales' do not feedback to affect 'discount_factor'.",
