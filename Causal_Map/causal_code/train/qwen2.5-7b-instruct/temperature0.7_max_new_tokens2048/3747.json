  "Explanation": "Seeing a 'tax_bracket' of 'high' does suggest a high income, but only if 'is_adult' is True, as the 'tax_bracket' calculation is conditional not only upon 'income' but also upon whether 'income' is calculated for an adult ('is_adult' is True). We need to verify both that the individual is an adult and the income exceeds 50000.",
