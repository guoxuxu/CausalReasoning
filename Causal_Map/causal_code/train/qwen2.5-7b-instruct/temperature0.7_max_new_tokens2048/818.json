  "Problem": "def process_sales_data(prices, discounts, region):\n    if region == 'East':\n        tax_rate = 0.07\n    else:\n        tax_rate = 0.1\n    final_prices = [(price - discount) * (1 + tax_rate) for price, discount in zip(prices, discounts)]\n    return final_prices\",\n\nIf discounts are increased across the board, will this reduce the final prices?",
  "Explanation": "By reducing the amount subtracted as discount from the original prices, the resultant base price before tax becomes lower. Even after applying a tax rate, the final price will still be reduced because it's calculated on a now lower base price.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Discounts directly reduce final prices, and region determines the tax rate which then affects final prices."
