  "Problem": "def process_data(data, flag): \n    if flag: \n        result = data * 2 \n    else: \n        result = data + 100 \n    return result \n\ndef final_result(data_point, action_flag): \n    intermediate = process_data(data_point, action_flag) \n    if intermediate > 150: \n        output = 'High' \n    else: \n        output = 'Low' \n    return output\",\n\nIf the variable 'action_flag' is set to True, will the 'result' potentially be greater than 200 for 'data_point' values greater than 100?",
  "Explanation": "Setting 'action_flag' to True causes 'process_data' to execute 'result = data * 2'. For 'data_point' values greater than 100, the result will be greater than 200 when doubled, invoking 'result = data * 2'.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
