  "Problem": "class WeatherController { constructor() { this.temperature = 20; this.humidity = 50; } heatUp() { this.temperature += 5; this.updateHumidity(); } cooldown() { this.temperature -= 5; this.updateHumidity(); } updateHumidity() { this.humidity = this.temperature > 25 ? 60 : 40; } } const controller = new WeatherController(); controller.heatUp(); console.log(controller.temperature, controller.humidity);\",\n\nIf the method heatUp() is called, will the humidity be affected?",
  "Explanation": "Calling heatUp() increases temperature and consequently calls updateHumidity(), which adjusts humidity based on the new temperature. This showcases a causal relationship from cause (heatUp activation) to effect (humidity level changes) without direct intervention in humidity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "When heatUp() is called, the temperature increases, which then affects the humidity by setting it to 60 if the temperature is greater than 25, otherwise to 40."
