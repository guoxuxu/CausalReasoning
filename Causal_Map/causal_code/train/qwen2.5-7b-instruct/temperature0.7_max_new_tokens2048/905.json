  "Explanation": "An increase in voter turnout could be caused by either an increase in population or the presence of an awareness campaign, or other factors not covered in the code like decrease in fees. Without isolating other variables, an increase in turnout alone cannot conclusively indicate the occurrence of an awareness campaign.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
