  "Explanation": "The lack of new alerts might not necessarily mean that the monitoring has stopped or that the variables are within normal ranges; it may also be due to not calling the check or adjustment methods, or the conditions for setting alerts are not being met even though the environment factors are abnormal.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
