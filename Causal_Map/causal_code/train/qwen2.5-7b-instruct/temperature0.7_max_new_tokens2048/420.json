  "Explanation": "Changing the sum of the result variable does not provide direct information about the threshold, because the threshold's calculation also depends implicitly on the distribution of the data, specifically its mean and standard deviation. The sum alone doesn't uniquely determine the threshold.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
