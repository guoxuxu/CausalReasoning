  "Problem": "def process_data(input_data):\n    modified_data = input_data * 2\n    output_data = modified_data + 10\n    return output_data\n\ndef main():\n    initial_data = 5\n    result = process_data(initial_data)\n    print(result)\",\n\nIf we modify the 'process_data' function to triple 'input_data' instead of doubling it, will this change the output 'result' for a given 'initial_data'?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the operation within 'process_data' from doubling to tripling directly affects how 'input_data' is processed, thereby altering the final 'result'. This intervention in the processing mechanism directly impacts the causal effect from 'input_data' to 'result'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
