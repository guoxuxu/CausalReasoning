  "Problem": "public class WeatherSimulator { int temperature; boolean isRaining; public WeatherSimulator(int temp, boolean rain) { this.temperature = temp; this.isRaining = rain; } public void updateWeather(int newTemp, boolean newRain) { this.temperature = newTemp; this.isRaining = newRain; } public boolean isCold() { return this.temperature < 50; } public boolean willRainSoon() { return this.isRaining && this.temperature < 60; } }\",\n\nIf we manually set the temperature to 55 and change the rain status to true, will the method willRainSoon() return true?",
  "Explanation": "By intervening and setting the temperature to 55 (which is below 60) and making it rain (setting rain status to true), the conditions for willRainSoon() are satisfied, hence it will return true.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
