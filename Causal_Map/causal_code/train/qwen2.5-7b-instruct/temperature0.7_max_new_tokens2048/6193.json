  "Explanation": "Manually setting `windSpeed` above 20.0 and lowering `temperature` below 15 forces the conditions in the `determineRainStatus()` method to be met, resulting in `isRaining` being set to true when the method is executed in the `updateWeather` function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
