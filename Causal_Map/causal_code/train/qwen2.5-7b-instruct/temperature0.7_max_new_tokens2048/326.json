  "Explanation": "Given that Alex has three items in his list and the condition to purchase items is having at least 10 dollars per item, Alex purchasing items means his budget was sufficient for the number of items in his list multiplied by the cost per item. This question requires discerning the prerequisite budget from observing the purchase effect.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
