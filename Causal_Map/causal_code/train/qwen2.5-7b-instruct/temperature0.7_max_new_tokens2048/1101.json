  "Explanation": "Since the 'company_status' is determined by whether any single sale exceeds 100000, increasing the volume of sales can potentially include higher individual sales amounts, which can change the 'company_status' to 'Leading'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
