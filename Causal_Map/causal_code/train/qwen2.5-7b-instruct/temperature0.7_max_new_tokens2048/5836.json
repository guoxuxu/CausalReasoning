  "Explanation": "In the code, the health decrease is a result of being sick (and not the cause). The sickness is triggered by exposure to a strong virus (strength > 10), not by the reduction in health. Thus, decreasing health alone cannot cause a patient to become sick.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
