  "Explanation": "enrich_data processes the data after clean_data has already executed, so changes in enrich_data affect only the downstream operations (e.g., adding 'age_group') but not the output of clean_data itself.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Modifying the implementation of `enrich_data` will affect the output of `clean_data` because `enrich_data` uses the 'age' column from the data, which is processed by `clean_data`. The relationship between 'age' and 'age_group' shows that changes in how 'age' is handled in `clean_data` can indirectly impact the output of `enrich_data`."
