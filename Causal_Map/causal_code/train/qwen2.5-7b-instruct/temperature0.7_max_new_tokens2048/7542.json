  "Explanation": "A report of 'Poor' air quality indicates that either the air purifier is not turned on or the filter is dirty (or both). This inference is based on the return condition of the `check_air_quality` method, which only returns 'Good' when the air purifier is on and the filter is clean. Hence, poor quality indicates the failure of either or both conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
