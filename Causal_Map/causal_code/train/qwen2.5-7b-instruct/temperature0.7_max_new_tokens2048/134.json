  "Explanation": "An increase in discount will raise the product price if demand is greater than 100, thereby potentially reducing sales volume as the selling price per unit will increase, and the quantity sold may drop if the sensitivity to price is significant.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
