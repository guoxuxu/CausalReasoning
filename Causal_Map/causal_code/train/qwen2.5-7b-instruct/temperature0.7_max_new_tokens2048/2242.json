  "Explanation": "Altering the 'average' does not feed back to affect how data is normalized. 'normalize' operates independently of the computations done in 'analyze' since there is no backward dependency from 'analyze' to 'normalize'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The 'data' is cleaned to produce 'cleaned_data', which is then normalized to produce 'normalized_data'. The 'normalized_data' is used to calculate the 'average' in the 'analyze' function, but changes in the 'average' do not affect the normalization process."
