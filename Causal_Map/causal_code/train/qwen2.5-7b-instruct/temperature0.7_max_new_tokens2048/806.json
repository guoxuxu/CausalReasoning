  "Problem": "def compute_sales_data(prices, discounts, tax_rate):\n    final_prices = [(p - p * d) for p, d in zip(prices, discounts)]\n    tax_amounts = [fp * tax_rate for fp in final_prices]\n    total_sales = sum([fp + ta for fp, ta in zip(final_prices, tax_amounts)])\n    return total_sales\",\n\nIf the government implements a policy to reduce the tax rate, will this intervention likely increase the total sales?",
  "Explanation": "Reducing the tax rate decreases the overall cost to the consumer for each product, assuming no other changes in prices or discounts. This could potentially increase consumer purchasing power and lead to an increase in total sales, given the price elasticity of demand.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "A reduction in the tax rate (tax_rate → total_sales) and changes in product prices (prices → final_prices) and discounts (discounts → final_prices) can affect the total sales (total_sales), as final prices determine the tax amount (final_prices → tax_amounts), which in turn influences the total sales (tax_amounts → total_sales)."
