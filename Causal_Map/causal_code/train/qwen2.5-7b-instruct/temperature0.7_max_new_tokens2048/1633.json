  "Explanation": "Changing the set point to match the current temperature will result in 'adjust_temperature' returning 'maintain', 0. Consequently, 'control_system' will call 'maintain_temperature', thereby stabilizing the system without further action.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "When the set point temperature matches the current temperature, the system determines no action is needed ('maintain'), which prevents further changes to the heating or cooling systems."
