  "Explanation": "Eliminating coupon usage (changing 'has_coupon' from True to False) will remove the additional discount provided by the 'apply_coupon' function, thus increasing the amounts for each sale where a coupon would otherwise have been applied. This can result in an overall increase in collected amounts, if coupon usage was previously widespread.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Eliminating coupon usage (has_coupon → final_amount) can reduce the final amount collected. The customer type (customer_type → discounted_price) and original price (price → discounted_price) also influence the discounted price, which then affects the final amount (discounted_price → final_amount)."
