  "Explanation": "Blood sugar level changes can be due to other interventions such as the 'treat_diabetes' method which directly modifies the blood sugar level by decreasing it. Therefore, a change in blood sugar level does not necessarily mean the patient's age has changed.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
