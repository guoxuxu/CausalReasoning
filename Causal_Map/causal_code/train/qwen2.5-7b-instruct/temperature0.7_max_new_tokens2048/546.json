  "Problem": "def compute_discount(items, coupon_code):\n    total = sum(item['price'] * item['quantity'] for item in items)\n    discount = 0\n    if coupon_code == '20OFF':\n        discount = total * 0.2\n    elif coupon_code == '10OFF':\n        discount = total * 0.1\n    return total - discount\",\n\nIf the final payable amount is found increased, can we conclude that there was an increase in the list of items and their quantities?",
  "Explanation": "Although increasing items and quantities directly contributes to an increase in the total amount, the final amount payable also depends on the discount applied. For instance, even if the total increases, the use of a higher discount coupon ('20OFF' instead of '10OFF') could counteract and lead to a lower or similar payable amount.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
