  "Problem": "def compute_score(health_index, environment_factor, genetic_factor):\n    base_score = 50\n    adjusted_health_score = base_score + (health_index * 10) - (environment_factor * 5)\n    final_score = adjusted_health_score + (genetic_factor * 15)\n    return final_score\",\n\nAssuming genetic_factor remains constant, does a decrease in final_score suggest a change in health_index?",
  "Explanation": "With genetic_factor held constant, the only factors affecting final_score are health_index and environment_factor. Therefore, a decrease in final_score implies that there must be either a decrease in health_index or an increase in environment_factor. Since environmental factors are not specified as constant, we cannot definitively isolate health_index as the only cause, but it remains a likely factor.",
