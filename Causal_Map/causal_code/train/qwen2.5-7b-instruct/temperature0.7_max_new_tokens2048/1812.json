  "Explanation": "By improving air quality from 'poor' to 'good' or 'moderate', and if the stress level stays constant at 'high', the productivity can still end up being higher ('medium' or 'high') as per the `productivity` function. The function explicitly sets productivity to 'low' only when either stress is high or air quality is poor, therefore improving air quality mitigates one of the negative factors.",
