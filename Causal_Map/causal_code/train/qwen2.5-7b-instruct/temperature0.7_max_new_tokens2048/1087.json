  "Explanation": "Since 'swimming' occurs at temperatures above 75 degrees, even if the season is changed to 'winter', the unchanged temperature that resulted in 'swimming' must have been above 75 degrees.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
