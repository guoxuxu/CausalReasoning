  "Explanation": "With the application of a 'SAVE30' coupon, the price drops by 30, lowering it from 100 to 70. To reach a final price of 80, an additional discount of 10 must have been applied, which would only occur if the individual is a student (since the age discount would have reduced it even more). Thus, we can infer one other discount type must apply — the customer is a student.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If a 'SAVE30' coupon code is used, then a coupon discount of 30 is applied; age being less than 18 results in an age discount, and being a student results in a student discount."
