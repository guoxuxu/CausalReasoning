  "Problem": "def calculate_sales(price, tax_rate, discount, quantity):\n    tax_amount = price * tax_rate\n    discount_amount = price * discount\n    final_price = (price + tax_amount - discount_amount) * quantity\n    return final_price\n\nsales = calculate_sales(100, 0.07, 0.05, 50)\",\n\nIf we manually set the tax rate to 0% while holding other conditions constant, will the final sales value decrease?",
  "Explanation": "Removing the tax removes the tax_amount from the final_price calculation, making the final_price solely dependent on the price and discount. This generally results in a lower final_price, hence a lower final sales value.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "A decrease in tax_rate directly reduces final_price, assuming other conditions such as discount, price, and quantity remain constant."
