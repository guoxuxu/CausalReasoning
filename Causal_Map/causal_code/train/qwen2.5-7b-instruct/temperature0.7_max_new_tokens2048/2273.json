  "Problem": "{\n        \"Description\": \"A software module for a content management system where posts by users are automatically categorized based on keywords and tagged by sentiment before being published. The sentiment tagging can occasionally fail due to API timeouts.\",\n        \"Code\": \"def categorize_post(post):\n    keywords = extract_keywords(post.content)\n    category = determine_category(keywords)\n    return category\n\ndef tag_sentiment(post):\n    try:\n        sentiment = sentiment_analysis_api(post.content)\n    except TimeoutError:\n        sentiment = 'Unknown'\n    post.sentiment = sentiment\n    return sentiment\n\ndef publish_post(post):\n    category = categorize_post(post)\n    sentiment = tag_sentiment(post)\n    database.save(post.category, post.sentiment, post.content)\n    return 'Post Published'\"\n    },\n\nIf a new policy requires manual review of posts with 'Unknown' sentiment tags before publishing, will this affect the number of posts published with incorrect categories?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention targets posts based on their sentiment tagging, which is independent of the categorization process. Categorizing posts is handled by a separate function using keywords extracted from the content, not sentiment. Thus, manual review based on sentiment would not impact the accuracy of categories assigned to posts.",
