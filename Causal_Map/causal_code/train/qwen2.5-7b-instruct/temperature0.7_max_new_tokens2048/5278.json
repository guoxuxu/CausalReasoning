  "Explanation": "If the decreaseSize method is altered so that health remains unchanged when the population size is decreased, then an increase in health would no longer be logically attributable solely to a change in population size, especially since other factors could influence health.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
