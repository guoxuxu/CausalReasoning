  "Explanation": "Intervening by modifying data_sequence to only include values greater than 8 ensures that all values in processed_data, being tripled, are significantly high (all greater than 24), thereby increasing the average computed in analyze_data. This is a direct result of the intervention leading to higher values being fed into the process_data function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Values greater than 8 in data_sequence lead to a modified data_sequence, which results in processed_data that includes more elements, potentially increasing the average, thus making the average more likely to be higher."
