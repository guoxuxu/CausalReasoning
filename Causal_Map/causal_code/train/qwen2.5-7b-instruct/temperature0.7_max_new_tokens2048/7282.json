  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(price, membership_status, promo_code_active):\n    discount = 0\n    if membership_status:\n        discount += 10\n    if promo_code_active:\n        discount += 5\n    final_price = max(0, price - (price * discount / 100))\n    return final_price\",\n\nDoes a reduction in final_price imply there was an increase in promo_code_active?",
  "Explanation": "A reduction in final price can be due to either the activation of a promo code or becoming a member, since both conditions contribute to an increased discount. Therefore, reduction in final price alone doesn't necessarily imply that there was an increase specifically in promo_code_active.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
