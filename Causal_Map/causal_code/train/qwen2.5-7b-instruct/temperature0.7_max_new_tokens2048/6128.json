  "Problem": "def compute_interest(balance, rate):\n  interest = balance * rate\n  return interest\n\nbalance = 1000\ndiscount_rate = 0.05\nif balance > 500:\n  adjusted_rate = discount_rate - 0.01\nelse:\n  adjusted_rate = discount_rate\nfinal_interest = compute_interest(balance, adjusted_rate)\",\n\nConsidering the value of final_interest yielded, can we deduce whether the original balance was greater than 500?",
  "Explanation": "Final interest alone cannot determine the balance threshold because the same interest amount could theoretically be achieved with different balances and rates due to multiplication's distributive properties.",
