  "Explanation": "A decrease in the final price might be due to a decrease in the product price itself or an increase in the discount; thus, we cannot conclusively say that a decrease in final price implies an increase in the discount without additional contextual information regarding the product price.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
