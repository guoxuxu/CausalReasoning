  "Explanation": "Although increasing activity level does result in higher calorie recommendations, an increase in the recommended calories could also occur if a user's age group changes from over 50 to 50 and below, which could happen with an error in data input or age grouping. Therefore, an increase in calories doesn't definitively indicate an increase in activity level without confirmation of the cause.",
