  "Explanation": "No, a change in the prediction result is more likely due to the type of model trained (linear or tree) and its parameters, rather than changes in the data preprocessing. The preprocessing step in this setup works independently in terms of mean-centering and scaling and is unlikely to show the impact solely from external modifications unless these modifications alter the fundamental statistical properties of the data set.",
