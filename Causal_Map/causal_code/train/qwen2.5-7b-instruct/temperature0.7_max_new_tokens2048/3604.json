  "Explanation": "As the random.seed function is called with a fixed seed of 42, the behavior of any random functions used later in the code should be deterministic, leading to a consistent result each time for the same initial conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Setting the seed for random number generation to 42 ensures that the initial_price remains 120, which leads to a specific price after applying the increase_price function. This price then determines the demand through the demand_prediction function. Depending on whether the demand exceeds 80, the final_price is either decreased or increased, resulting in a consistent final_price when all other conditions remain constant."
