  "Problem": "def classify_student(scores): \n    if scores['math'] > 90 and scores['science'] > 85: \n        return 'high' \n    elif scores['math'] < 60 or scores['science'] < 60: \n        return 'low' \n    else: \n        return 'average'\",\n\nIf we set the threshold of science scores to 91 while keeping a student's scores unchanged, would a student with 92 in math and 86 in science still be classified as 'high'?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the threshold to 91 affects the classification as the science score now fails to meet the new criteria for 'high', regardless of the math score meeting the old condition.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If a student's math score is greater than 90 and their science score is greater than 85, they will be classified as 'high'. If either math or science score is less than 60, they will be classified as 'low'. Otherwise, they will be classified as 'average'. Setting the science score threshold to 91 means that a student with a math score of 92 and a science score of 86 will not meet the new high classification criteria since their science score is no longer greater than 91."
