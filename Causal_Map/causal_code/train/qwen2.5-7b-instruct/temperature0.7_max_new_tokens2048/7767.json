  "Explanation": "The satisfaction score is primarily determined by the score variable, with different thresholds set at 50 and 80. A score fixed at 30 categorizes satisfaction as 'low', regardless of the bonus. Increasing the bonus over 50 will append ' and happy' leading to 'low and happy', not 'high and happy'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "When the bonus is greater than 50 and the score is less than or equal to 50, satisfaction becomes 'low and happy'. If the score is between 51 and 80, satisfaction becomes 'medium and happy'. If the score is greater than 80, satisfaction becomes 'high' regardless of the bonus amount."
