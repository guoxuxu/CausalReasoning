  "Explanation": "While a decrease in 'average_sales_discounted' could be due to an increase in 'discount_rate', it could also be because a higher proportion of sales were under 280 and weren't subject to the discount, or other factors not controlled here might have caused it. Hence, we cannot conclusively link a decrease in 'average_sales_discounted' solely to an increase in 'discount_rate' without additional data.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
