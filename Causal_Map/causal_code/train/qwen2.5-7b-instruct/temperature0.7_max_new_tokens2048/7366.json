  "Explanation": "A higher 'calculateFinalPrice()' could be due to either an increased 'price' or because the 'hasPromotion' was false (no discount applied). Since the discount application based on promotion status can also affect the 'calculateFinalPrice()', we cannot definitively say that a higher 'calculateFinalPrice()' results from a higher 'price' alone.",
