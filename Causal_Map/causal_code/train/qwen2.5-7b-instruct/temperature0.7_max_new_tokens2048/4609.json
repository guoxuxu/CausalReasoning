  "Explanation": "Adding 'error' to the beginning of each string ensures that 'error' will always be present in the input to the 'process_data' function, which in turn makes the function return a status of 'fail' every time, as per the current logic.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
