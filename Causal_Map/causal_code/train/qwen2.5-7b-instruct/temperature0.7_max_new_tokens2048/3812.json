  "Explanation": "The code applies a 1.1x multiplier to sales when `ad_budget` is below 30,000 and a 1.3x multiplier in a medium season regardless of store rating. Strategic reduction in ad budgets for lower-rated stores would result in a lesser multiplier effect (1.1x) compared to when the budget is above 30,000 (which could yield a 1.2x multiplier), hence reducing the overall potential sales increase.",

  "causal_map_integration": "Store rating and ad budget directly influence base sales, while season modifies the effect on base sales. Reducing ad budgets for lower store ratings will decrease base sales unless the season is high, which amplifies sales regardless of other factors."
