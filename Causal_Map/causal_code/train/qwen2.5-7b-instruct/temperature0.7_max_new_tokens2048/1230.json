  "Explanation": "Manually increasing the `current_temp` to a value equal to or higher than the `target_temp` and then running `check_heater` will result in `heater_on` being set to false. This is a direct intervention on the `current_temp` causing an effect on the `heater_on` status.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
