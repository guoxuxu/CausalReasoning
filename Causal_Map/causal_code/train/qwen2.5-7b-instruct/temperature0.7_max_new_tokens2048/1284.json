  "Explanation": "The function only sets productivity to 'high' if the temperature is above 25 degrees and mood is 'happy' (which occurs when temperature is above 20 degrees).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If the temperature is greater than 20 degrees, the mood becomes happy, which leads to high productivity only if the temperature is also greater than 25 degrees. Conversely, if the temperature is 25 degrees or lower, it results in a sad mood or low productivity."
