  "Explanation": "The code checks if the temperature is below 18 degrees and turns the heating on if it is. Therefore, if the temperature is less than 18, the heating will indeed be turned on.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
