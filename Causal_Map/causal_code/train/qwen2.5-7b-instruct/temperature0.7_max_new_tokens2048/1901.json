  "Explanation": "In the code, the only condition that categorizes someone as 'Adult' is if the 'age' key exists in the data dictionary and the value of 'age' is greater than 30. There is no other code path that assigns 'Adult' without this condition being true.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
