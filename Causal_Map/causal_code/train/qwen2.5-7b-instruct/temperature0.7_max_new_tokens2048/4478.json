  "Problem": "{\n    \"description\": \"In a simulation of an ecosystem, three types of organisms exist: plants, herbivores, and predators. The number of plants directly influences the herbivore population, as they are the food source for the herbivores. The number of herbivores, in turn, affects the predator population, who preys on them. Environmental factors can also increase or decrease the rates of reproduction and death in all populations. The code models this dynamic system as a set of differential equations influenced by parameters like birth rate, death rate, and interaction rates between the populations.\"\n  },\n\nIf a disease is introduced that targets only predators, and subsequently the predator population decreases, can this be interpreted that the herbivore population increased to cause the predator population to decrease?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a disease targeting predators directly decreases the predator population independent of the herbivore population. Thus, the decrease in predator numbers is caused by the disease, not by changes in the herbivore population.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
