  "Explanation": "The final_price is calculated as price - discount. While increasing the price would normally increase the final_price, it also increases the discount (10% of price), which moderates the increase in final_price.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "If the 'price' field in the input data is increased, the 'final_price' field in the output may not necessarily increase because the 'final_price' is determined after applying the 'discount'. The 'discount' itself can be influenced by the 'price' and 'quantity', so an increase in 'price' could lead to a larger discount, potentially resulting in a lower 'final_price'."
