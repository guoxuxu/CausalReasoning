  "Explanation": "The causality that temperature below 20 leads to rain is not dynamically linked to temperature decreases during the runtime, except at initialization or via the `artificialRain` method. A simple reduction in temperature due to external factors doesn't necessarily start the rain unless it invokes `artificialRain` or reinitializes the temperature below 20 at instantiation, neither of which are guaranteed by a simple external action.",
