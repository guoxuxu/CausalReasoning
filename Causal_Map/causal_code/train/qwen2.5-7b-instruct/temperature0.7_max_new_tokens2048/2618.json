  "Problem": "class ProductSales { constructor(price, discount) { this.price = price; this.discount = discount; this.finalPrice = this.calculateFinalPrice(); } calculateFinalPrice() { return this.price - (this.price * this.discount); } updatePrice(newPrice) { this.price = newPrice; this.finalPrice = this.calculateFinalPrice(); } updateDiscount(newDiscount) { this.discount = newDiscount; this.finalPrice = this.calculateFinalPrice(); } } const product = new ProductSales(100, 0.2); product.updatePrice(120); product.updateDiscount(0.25);\",\n\nIf the price of the product increases, will the final price increase?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the price alone typically increases the final price, but with a fixed discount rate proportionally reducing the price based on the percentage, the increase in the price might not always result directly in an increase in the final price if the discount is also adjusted accordingly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
