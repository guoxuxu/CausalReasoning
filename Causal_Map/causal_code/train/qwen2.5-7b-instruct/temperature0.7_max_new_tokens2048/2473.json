  "Problem": "def weather_effect(day):\n  if day == 'sunny':\n    mood = 'happy'\n    productivity = 'high'\n  elif day == 'rainy':\n    mood = 'sad'\n    productivity = 'low'\n  else:\n    mood = 'neutral'\n    productivity = 'medium'\n  return mood, productivity\n\nweather = 'sunny'\nmood, productivity = weather_effect(weather)\",\n\nIf we artificially modify the mood to 'happy', will the productivity change to 'high'?",
  "Explanation": "The function 'weather_effect' determines productivity based purely on the weather condition, independent of the mood variable. Therefore, even if an intervention alters the mood to 'happy', it does not affect the productivity according to the code.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Weather directly influences both mood and productivity. Modifying the mood to 'happy' when the weather is not sunny may not necessarily cause productivity to become 'high', as productivity is also directly influenced by the weather and may not change solely based on mood modification."
