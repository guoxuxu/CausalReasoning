  "Explanation": "The state of `isRainy` being false does not necessarily imply that the temperature was set below zero. `isRainy` might have been initially set to false or not modified at all by `adjustTemperature`. Thus, knowing the effect (`isRainy` is false) does not reliably allow us to deduce the specific cause (temperature set below zero) without additional information about other interactions affecting `isRainy`.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
