  "Problem": "def update_records(database, record_id, new_value):\n    if 'status' in new_value:\n        database[record_id]['status'] = new_value['status']\n    if 'amount' in new_value and database[record_id]['status'] == 'active':\n        database[record_id]['balance'] += new_value['amount']\n    return database\",\n\nIf an intervention is made to ensure the record's status is 'active', does adding an 'amount' in 'new_value' increase the balance?",
  "Explanation": "With the intervention setting the status to 'active', any subsequent addition of 'amount' in 'new_value' will result in an increase in the record's balance, as the code checks for 'active' status before adding the amount to the balance.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
