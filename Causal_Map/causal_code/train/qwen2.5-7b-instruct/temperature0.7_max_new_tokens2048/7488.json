  "Explanation": "Changing `feelRested` to false does not affect the actual `sleepHours` logged. The value of `sleepHours` influences `feelRested`, but not vice versa; hence, altering `feelRested` is an example of intervention that does not impact the cause (sleep hours logged) from the effect side.",
