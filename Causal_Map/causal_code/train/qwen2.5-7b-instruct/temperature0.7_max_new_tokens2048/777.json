  "Explanation": "When 'status' is set to 'success', it implies that the 'error' key was not found in the data, as delineated in the conditional if-else structure. Therefore, the code flow suggests that if the 'status' is 'success', there was no error. This tests the reasoning from effect to cause without intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The presence of an error in data leads to setting 'status' to 'fail' and logging the error. The absence of an error sets 'status' to 'success'. The amount influences the discount applied based on whether it is greater than 1000."
