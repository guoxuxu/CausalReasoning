  "Explanation": "When a promotion is activated (`promotion_active = True`), the sales formula uses `1.2 * quantity` which inherently results in higher sales than the `sales += quantity` used when no promotion is active, assuming no crossing of discount thresholds.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If promotion_active, then sales increases by 1.2 times the quantity sold, minus 10% discount if quantity exceeds 100. Otherwise, sales increases by the quantity sold, minus 5 if quantity exceeds 100."
