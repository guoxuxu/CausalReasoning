  "Explanation": "The code contains a mechanism to equalize the room temperature with environmental temperature over time (0.1 factor in natural temperature equalization). However, if the heater is on, the temperature might actually increase due to the heater's effect, overshadowing the drop in the external temperature.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
