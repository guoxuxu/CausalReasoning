  "Explanation": "Without holidays affecting the sales, the only other factor in the function that directly modifies sales is the presence of a promotion. If sales decrease due to the absence of holiday effects, it indicates that promotions, which would have increased sales, were likely not applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
