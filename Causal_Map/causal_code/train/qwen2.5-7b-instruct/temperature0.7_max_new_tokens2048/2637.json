  "Explanation": "Switching to a 'minimal_campaign' is not exclusively indicative of poor economic conditions. According to the provided code, it could also be a result of a low budget irrespective of economic conditions. Therefore, it can't be stated that the economic condition was 'poor' based solely on the implementation of a 'minimal_campaign'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The marketing strategy influences sales, and economic conditions also influence sales. Switching the marketing strategy to 'minimal_campaign' does not definitively indicate poor economic conditions, as sales performance can vary based on the interaction between the marketing strategy and economic conditions."
