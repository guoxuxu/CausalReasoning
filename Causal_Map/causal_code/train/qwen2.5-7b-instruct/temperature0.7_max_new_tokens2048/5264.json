  "Explanation": "If it is raining, the 'rain' variable would have been set to true only under conditions where 'cloudy' is also true, either naturally or as part of an intervention. No rain can occur when it's not cloudy, according to the code logic.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
