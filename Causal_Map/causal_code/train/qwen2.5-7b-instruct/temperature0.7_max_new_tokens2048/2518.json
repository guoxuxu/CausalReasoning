  "Explanation": "Even though setting 'user_score' to 70 would result in a 'status' of 'high', achieving a 'high' status does not imply that the 'user_score' was exactly 70 before changing. The original 'user_score' could have been any number that, once 10 is added, results in a score higher than 75.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "user_score influences status through score: if user_score is high enough (greater than 75 after adding 10), status becomes 'high'. Otherwise, it becomes 'normal'. Given 'status' is 'high', 'user_score' must have been at least 65 and increased by at least 15 to exceed 75."
