  "Problem": "def compute_discount(items, coupon_code):\n    total = sum(item['price'] * item['quantity'] for item in items)\n    discount = 0\n    if coupon_code == '20OFF':\n        discount = total * 0.2\n    elif coupon_code == '10OFF':\n        discount = total * 0.1\n    return total - discount\",\n\nIf the final payable amount is significantly less than expected, can we conclude that a '20OFF' coupon code was definitely used?",
  "Explanation": "While using a '20OFF' coupon code reduces the payable amount, concluding that it was definitely used is not certain. The reduced payable amount could also be due to other potential changes such as pricing errors, misreported quantities, or even a different coupon code providing a similar or larger discount. The causality can't be determined without other information validating the use of the specific coupon.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The coupon code directly influences the discount, total, and final payable amount. Specifically, '20OFF' leads to a larger discount, reducing the total and final payable amount more significantly compared to '10OFF'. Therefore, if the final payable amount is significantly less than expected, it suggests that either '20OFF' or '10OFF' was used, but cannot definitively conclude '20OFF' without further information."
