  "Explanation": "Within the `logWaterIntake` method, `feelDehydrated` is only set to true when `waterIntake` is less than 2 liters, establishing a direct causal association from the effect of feeling dehydrated back to the cause of low water intake, without external intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
