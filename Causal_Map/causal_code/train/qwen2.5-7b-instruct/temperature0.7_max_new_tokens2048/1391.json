  "Problem": "def compute_metrics(data):\n    sales = sum(item['sales'] for item in data)\n    losses = sum(item['loss'] for item in data)\n    profit = sales - losses\n    tax = 0.2 * profit if profit > 0 else 0\n    net_profit = profit - tax\n    return {'sales': sales, 'losses': losses, 'profit': profit, 'net_profit': net_profit}\",\n\nIf the sales data increases, will the net_profit necessarily increase without making other changes?",
  "Explanation": "Since `net_profit` is calculated based on `profit`, which directly depends on `sales` subtracted by `losses`, increasing `sales` while keeping `losses` the same will increase `profit` and consequently `net_profit`, assuming tax calculations remain constant.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
