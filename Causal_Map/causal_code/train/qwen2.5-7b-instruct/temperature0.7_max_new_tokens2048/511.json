  "Explanation": "Improving the diet quality (making 'diet_quality' >= 3) would eliminate the 25 points added for poor diet in the 'calculate_risk' method, thus reducing the total health risk.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
