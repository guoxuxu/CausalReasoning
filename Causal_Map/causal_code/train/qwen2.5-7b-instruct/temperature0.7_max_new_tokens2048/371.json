  "Explanation": "Changing the random seed indeed influences the sequence of random numbers generated, and hence the noise added. However, the noise remains random and unpredictable (though reproducible with the same seed), not forming a consistent pattern in the data outcomes, reflecting an intervention without a predictable effect.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
