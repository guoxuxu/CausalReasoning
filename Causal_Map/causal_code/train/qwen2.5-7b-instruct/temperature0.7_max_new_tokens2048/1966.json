  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator {\n  int temperature;\n  bool isRainy;\n  bool isHoliday;\n\n  WeatherSimulator(int temp, bool rain) {\n    temperature = temp;\n    isRainy = rain;\n    isHoliday = determineHoliday(temp);\n  }\n\n  bool determineHoliday(int temp) {\n    if (temp > 30) return false;\n    return true;\n  }\n\n  bool shouldBringUmbrella() {\n    return isRainy && temperature < 25;\n  }\n}\",\n\nIf we change the method to declare every day with temperatures below 20 as a holiday, will more people bring umbrellas?",
  "Explanation": "The decision to bring an umbrella is based on both rain and temperature being below 25 degrees. Changing the holiday definition affects only the isHoliday status, not whether people bring umbrellas unless the temperature and rain conditions change as well.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Lower temperatures lead to more holidays and cooler weather, which in turn increases the likelihood of rain and prompts people to bring umbrellas."
