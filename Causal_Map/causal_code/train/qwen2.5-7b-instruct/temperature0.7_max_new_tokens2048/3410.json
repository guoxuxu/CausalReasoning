'Healthy' : 'Unhealthy'; } } const myGarden = new Plant(); myGarden.water(); myGarden.soakSun(); myGarden.dayPasses(); const plantStatus = myGarden.getStatus();\",\n\nIf a 'dayPasses()' method is called repeatedly without calling 'water()' or 'soakSun()', will the plant always become 'Unhealthy'?",
  "Explanation": "The 'dayPasses()' method reduces the water level by 4 units each time it is called. If 'water()' or 'soakSun()' are not called to increase the water level, repeated calls to 'dayPasses()' will eventually reduce the water level to below 10, resulting in the plant's status becoming 'Unhealthy'. This is a case of testing from cause (day passing without water or sun) to effect (health status of the plant).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
