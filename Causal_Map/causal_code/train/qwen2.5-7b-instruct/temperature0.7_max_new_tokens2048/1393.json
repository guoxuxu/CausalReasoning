  "Problem": "def compute_metrics(data):\n    sales = sum(item['sales'] for item in data)\n    losses = sum(item['loss'] for item in data)\n    profit = sales - losses\n    tax = 0.2 * profit if profit > 0 else 0\n    net_profit = profit - tax\n    return {'sales': sales, 'losses': losses, 'profit': profit, 'net_profit': net_profit}\",\n\nIf an intervention is made to fix the tax rate at 0.25 instead of 0.2, and sales remain the same but losses decrease, will this guarantee an increase in net_profit?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the tax rate to 0.25 increases the amount taxed from the profit, however, if the losses decrease while sales remain constant, the overall profit will increase even more significantly. Since the rise in profit from reducing losses outweighs the increase in tax, net_profit will still be higher.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Sales and losses affect profit, which in turn affects both tax and net profit. A higher tax rate reduces net profit unless the increase in profit from reduced losses is significant enough to offset the higher tax."
