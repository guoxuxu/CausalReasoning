  "Explanation": "From effect to cause with intervention: Fixing 'z' does not uniquely determine 'x', as 'z' depends on both 'x' and 'y', and also whether 'x' was positive or negative, which affects the calculation method of 'z'. Thus, 'x' cannot be uniquely discerned from 'z'.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The value of 'x' influences 'sum' and 'z', while 'y' influences 'sum'. Fixing 'z' does not directly determine 'x' because 'z' is calculated based on 'sum', which itself depends on both 'x' and 'y'."
