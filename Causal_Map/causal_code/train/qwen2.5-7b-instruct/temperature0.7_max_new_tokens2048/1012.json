  "Explanation": "The update_inventory() method is designed such that when the inventory of a product decreases due to a sale, it also increases the sales count for that product in the sales dictionary. This represents a direct causal link from cause (inventory decrease) to effect (sales increase) in the method implementation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
