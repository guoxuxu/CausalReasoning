  "Explanation": "The method adjustInterestRates modifies the inflation attribute of the Economy class instance based on the interest rate provided. If the rate is greater than 2.0, the inflation is explicitly reduced by 0.5, thus demonstrating a cause (increased rate) to effect (decrease in inflation) relationship directly resulting from the code's logic.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
