  "Explanation": "By changing the temperature to 82, and considering the existing humidity of 40, the calculated heat index becomes `82 + 0.5 * 40 - 10 = 92`. Given that 'Sunny' remains as the person, according to the code, a heat index above 80 changes the mood to 'Happy'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in temperature leads to a higher heat index, which in turn affects the person's mood status. Specifically, if the temperature is above 80, the person becomes Happy."
