  "Explanation": "With intervention equating all regional growth multipliers, differences in adjusted_growth can no longer be attributed to a region change because the realm of influence of region on adjusted_growth has been removed. Thus, adjusted_growth changes are only due to changes in sales.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
