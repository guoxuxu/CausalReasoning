  "Explanation": "Adjusting 'economic_index' impacts 'future_sales' through the 'economic_effect'. However, 'historical_sales' is a distinct input parameter and retains its original values regardless of changes in 'economic_index' or 'future_sales'. Therefore, changes in 'future_sales' do not imply changes in 'historical_sales'.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
