  "Explanation": "shouldBringUmbrella() returns false if either it is not raining or the temperature is 25 or above. If we set the temperature to 30 after observing a false return value, it does not isolate the cause to lack of rain as the method could initially return false due to a high temperature. Thus, intervention on temperature alone after observing the effect does not identify the initial state of rain.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
