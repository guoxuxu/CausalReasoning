  "Explanation": "According to the logic defined in the code, increasing pressure by 0.5 atmospheres results in a direct increase of 3 degrees in temperature but only if the pressure exceeds 1.5 atmospheres. Therefore, maintaining all other conditions constant and observing this specific temperature rise suggests it was due to the increase in pressure, given that it crossed the defined threshold.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
