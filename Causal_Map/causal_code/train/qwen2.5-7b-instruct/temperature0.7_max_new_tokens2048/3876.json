  "Explanation": "Even if the mood is set to 'happy', the activity 'go hiking' additionally depends on the productivity being 'high'. If productivity is 'medium' or 'low', the selected activity could be 'read books' instead.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
