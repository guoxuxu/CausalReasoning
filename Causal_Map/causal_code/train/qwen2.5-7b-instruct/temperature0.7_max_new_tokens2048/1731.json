  "Explanation": "The increase in 'totalSales' could be influenced by higher value transactions and not necessarily more transactions. Without knowing the amounts involved in each transaction or whether discount was applied, it's impossible to determine just from 'totalSales' if 'numTransactions' has increased, thus showing the limitations of inferring causal direction from effect to cause without additional information.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The increase in total sales does not necessarily imply an increase in the number of transactions without additional information, as total sales could also increase due to higher average sale amounts or discounts applied."
