  "Problem": "def student_grades(hours_studied, class_attendance, current_grade):\n    if class_attendance > 75:\n        performance_boost = 0.1\n    else:\n        performance_boost = 0\n\n    if hours_studied > 5:\n        study_boost = 0.2\n    else:\n        study_boost = 0\n\n    final_grade = current_grade + (current_grade * (performance_boost + study_boost))\n    return final_grade\n\ninitial_grade = 70\nfinal_score = student_grades(6, 80, initial_grade)\",\n\nIf the performance boost is significantly higher, can we assume that the class attendance was also high?",
  "Explanation": "A high performance boost could be a direct result of an intervention that adjusts how performance boost is calculated in relation to class attendance. Therefore, observing a high performance boost does not necessarily indicate actual high attendance without knowing if any interventions (e.g., changes in performance calculation) took place.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_map": "class_attendance > 75 → performance_boost = 0.1; hours_studied > 5 → study_boost = 0.2; current_grade → final_grade; class_attendance → final_grade; hours_studied → final_grade",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Higher class attendance increases the performance boost, which in turn raises the final grade; more hours studied also increases the study boost, contributing to a higher final grade."
