  "Explanation": "Setting the activity level to 0 removes the bonus of (activity_level * 10) from the 'adjusted_index'. Given the formula, unless there's any other variable that can compensate this (there isn't as per the code), 'adjusted_index' will decrease.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
