  "Explanation": "From the observed effect (still 'sick'), and knowing the cause (wrong treatment), we can infer that correcting the treatment to match the disease would lead to curing the patient, based on the system's treat logic.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
