  "Explanation": "Even after intervention, a 'final_value' of -1 does not conclusively indicate small original values; it might suggest the intervention did not amplify the values sufficiently or the cumulative total was still not enough, possibly due to the nature of the values (e.g., presence of zeros or small numbers).",
