  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, discount, base_demand, economy_boost):\n    if discount >= 20:\n        demand_increase = 15\n    elif discount >= 10:\n        demand_increase = 10\n    else:\n        demand_increase = 5\n\n    adjusted_demand = base_demand + demand_increase\n    if economy_boost:\n        adjusted_demand *= 1.1\n\n    revenue = adjusted_demand * (price * (1 - (discount / 100)))\n    return revenue\",\n\nAssuming a drop in 'revenue', if we later discover that 'economy_boost' was removed, could this change be the cause?",
  "Explanation": "The removal of 'economy_boost' results in a 10% decrease in the 'adjusted_demand', assuming other variables remain unchanged. This reduced demand directly impacts the 'revenue' negatively, contributing to its decline.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Removing economy_boost can reduce revenue. Lowering the discount, decreasing the price, reducing base_demand, and decreasing demand_increase can also reduce revenue."
