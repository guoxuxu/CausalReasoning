  "Explanation": "The discounted price being less than 100 does not necessarily imply that the base price was not updated. The base price increase could still have occurred, but the random increase and the percentage discount combined could result in a final price less than 100. Therefore, the relationship between the final discounted price being less than 100 and the absence of a base price update does not hold as a deterministic causation.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
