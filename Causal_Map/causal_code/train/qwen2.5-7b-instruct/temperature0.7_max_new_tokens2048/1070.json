  "Explanation": "By fixing 'b' and 'x' and only increasing 'a', the only variable affecting 'c' is 'a'. Since 'c' is 'a+b' and both 'b' and 'x' are constant, an increase in 'a' results directly in an increase in 'c', and in turn, since 'x > 0', increases 'd' which is 'c*x'. Thus, with no other changes, increasing 'a' will increase 'd'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Setting 'a' to a higher value will increase 'd' because 'a' directly influences 'c', which in turn influences 'd'. 'b' also directly influences 'c', but since 'x' is positive and constant, changes in 'a' and 'b' will proportionally affect 'd'. Therefore, increasing 'a' will increase 'd'. 'b' → d is also true but less directly influential compared to 'a' given the context."
