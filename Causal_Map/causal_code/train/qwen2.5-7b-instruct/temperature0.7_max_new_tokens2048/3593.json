  "Explanation": "The improvement in health status to 'Fair' could be due to either an improvement in diet quality or a decrease in environmental pollution level, or even both. Therefore, it is not certain that only the diet quality was intervened upon seeing the improvement.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
