  "Problem": "def calculate_revenue(prices, units_sold, tax_rate):\n    base_revenue = sum([price * units for price, units in zip(prices, units_sold)])\n    tax = base_revenue * tax_rate\n    final_revenue = base_revenue + tax\n    return final_revenue\",\n\nIf the 'prices' increase, will the 'final_revenue' increase?",
  "Explanation": "In the code, increased 'prices' lead directly to increased 'base_revenue' since each price is multiplied by the corresponding 'units_sold'. As 'base_revenue' increases, 'tax' calculated as a percentage of 'base_revenue' also increases, leading to an increase in 'final_revenue'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "prices → base_revenue; base_revenue → final_revenue; prices → final_revenue; units_sold → base_revenue; units_sold → final_revenue; tax_rate → tax; base_revenue → tax; tax → final_revenue",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in prices will lead to an increase in base revenue and final revenue, while higher units sold also contribute to increases in both base and final revenue; a higher tax rate leads to an increase in tax, which in turn increases final revenue."
