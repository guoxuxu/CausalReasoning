  "Problem": "class WeatherStation { float temperature = 25.0; boolean isRaining = false; void updateWeather(float newTemp, boolean rainStatus) { temperature = newTemp; isRaining = rainStatus; } float getTemperature() { return temperature; } boolean getRainStatus() { return isRaining; } } WeatherStation station = new WeatherStation(); station.updateWeather(30.0, true); float currentTemp = station.getTemperature(); boolean currentRainStatus = station.getRainStatus();\",\n\nIf the temperature reported is 30.0 degrees, is it certain that the 'updateWeather' method was called?",
  "Explanation": "The temperature initially set in the 'WeatherStation' class is 25.0 degrees. Since the current temperature is 30.0 degrees and this value can only be set via the 'updateWeather' method, it indicates that 'updateWeather' was indeed called to adjust the temperature.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
