  "Explanation": "Different machine learning models have varying methods of learning from data, each with unique capabilities and biases. Therefore, even with the same training data, different models could potentially produce different predictions, especially on the same unseen data.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
