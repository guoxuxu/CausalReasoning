  "Problem": "<above Python code>\",\n\nIf an intervention manually sets 'new_user.is_email_verified' to True, will this affect the execution of 'new_user.send_verification_email(email_system)'?",
  "Explanation": "The method 'send_verification_email' does not check the 'is_email_verified' status. It only checks if the user's email domain is '@example.com'. Thus, changing the verification status doesn't impact the email sending process.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Setting new_user.is_email_verified to True may prevent the execution of new_user.send_verification_email(email_system) because if the user is already verified, there's no need to send a verification email."
