  "Explanation": "An increase in 's2' could result from either a positive 'D', which doubles 's1', or substantial increases in 'A', 'B', and/or decreases in 'C' outweighing any negative impact of 'D' <= 0 (where 's2' would be 's1' - 10). Without additional information specifically about 'D', we cannot conclusively determine the reason for increase in 's2'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If D is positive, s2 will be twice s1; if D is non-positive, s2 will be s1 minus 10. Therefore, a significant increase in s2 suggests D was positive."
