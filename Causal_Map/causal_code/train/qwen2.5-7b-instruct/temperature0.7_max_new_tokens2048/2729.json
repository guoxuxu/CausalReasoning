  "Explanation": "Traffic lights being off does not necessarily mean there was an intervention to remove them. According to the class logic, traffic lights will naturally turn off if the car count decreases to 10 or fewer, without requiring manual intervention. Hence, lights being off could also be a natural effect of decreased traffic.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The presence of cars can trigger the installation or removal of traffic lights. Traffic lights turn on when the number of cars exceeds 10 without them being installed, and they turn off when the number of cars is 10 or fewer and are not installed. Direct interventions such as installing or removing traffic lights can also change their status."
