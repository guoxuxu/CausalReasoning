  "Explanation": "Raising the activity level above 5 awards an additional 30 points to the health score regardless of age or diet quality. Thus, enforcing high activity levels universally will statistically lead to higher average health scores.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
