  "Explanation": "Changing the category to 'Book' leads to a tax rate of 0.1 as opposed to 0.15 for other categories. However, this question assumes other conditions remain unchanged (e.g., price and quantity), and thus the final price would actually decrease due to the lower tax rate.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The category of the item determines the tax rate, which in turn affects the final price. Specifically, if the category changes to 'Book', the tax rate decreases, leading to a lower final price."
