  "Explanation": "This asks about causation from the effect (rainy weather) to a cause (increase in temperature) without intervention. It presumes a reverse causality which isn't supported directly by the structure as rainy can be set without temperature changes solely by calling setRainy(true), or from a previous state where the temperature was increased and exceeded 25.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
