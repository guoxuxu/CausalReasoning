  "Explanation": "Modifying the profit_multiplier affects only the final computation of profit from revenue. It does not provide direct information about pricing strategy or how prices were set, as these components are upstream in the causal chain and unaffected by changes in the profit_multiplier.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Adjusting the price influences the revenue and lost sales, which in turn affects the actual sales and ultimately the profit. The profit multiplier directly determines the profit based on the revenue. Increasing the number of products sold can boost actual sales, while modifying the profit multiplier alters the calculated profit."
