  "Explanation": "Increasing the `discount_rate` will lead to a larger discount amount once applied but only if `total_sales` surpasses `discount_threshold`. This could lower the `total_after_discount`, which could decrease or neutralize expected increases in `final_total` due to the smaller base for tax calculation, despite the higher `discount_rate`.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "A higher discount_rate may lead to a lower total_after_discount, which in turn may reduce the tax and ultimately the final_total, unless the increase in sales volume due to the discount offset this effect."
