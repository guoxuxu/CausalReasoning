  "Problem": "def compute_scores(temperature, pressure):\n    if temperature > 100:\n        score = 20\n    else:\n        score = 10\n    if pressure > 5:\n        score += 15\n    else:\n        score += 5\n    return score\",\n\nGiven the score was manually set to 25 by intervention, can we deduce the pressure was definitely higher than 5?",
  "Explanation": "Score of 25 could result from temperature being beyond 100 degrees (score = 20) with pressure <= 5 (score += 5) or temperature <= 100 degrees (score = 10) with pressure > 5 (score += 15). Both scenarios result in a score of 25.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
