  "Explanation": "According to the function, 'No Medication' is prescribed either if the patient is 50 years or younger without other stipulating random conditions being true or these conditions are not met if age is above 50. But, an intervention directly leading to 'No Medication' simplifies to the case where age is 50 or under.",
