  "Explanation": "The absence of snow suggests either the temperature is not below 0 or the humidity is not above 30, or both. Since the humidity was intervened to be set at 20, the humidity condition for snow is unmet. However, this scenario alone does not confirm the season change to summer as the lack of snow can result from various other non-seasonal factors or interventions affecting temperature or humidity.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Adjusting the humidity to 20 and observing that it does not snow allows us to infer that the season might not have been set to winter, given the conditions for snowing are temperature below 0 and humidity above 30. However, we cannot conclusively determine the season was summer without additional information."
