  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator { double temperature; boolean isRaining; WeatherSimulator(boolean rain, double temp) { isRaining = rain; temperature = temp; } void updateWeather() { if (temperature < 0) { isRaining = false; } temperature -= isRaining ? 5 : 10; } boolean willItRainTomorrow() { return temperature > 3 && !isRaining; } }\",\n\nIf you artificially set the weather to raining regardless of the temperature, can this lead to an increase in the temperature?",
  "Explanation": "Intervening to make it rain (setting 'isRaining' to true) affects the decrement of temperature in the 'updateWeather' method (reducing by 5 instead of 10). However, there is no mechanism in the provided code that increases temperature as a result of raining or other interventions. The temperature only reduces or remains stable; it does not increase due to weather conditions or interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
