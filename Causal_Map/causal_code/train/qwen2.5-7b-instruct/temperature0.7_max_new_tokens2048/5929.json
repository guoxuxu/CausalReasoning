  "Problem": "def compute_health_score(age, fitness_level, is_smoker):\n    score = 100\n    score -= age\n    if age > 50:\n        score -= 10\n    if fitness_level > 7:\n        score += 20\n    else:\n        score -= 20\n    if is_smoker:\n        score -= 30\n    return score\",\n\nIf we create a program to improve fitness levels, will the health score increase?",
  "Explanation": "Improving fitness levels from 7 or below to above 7 results in an additional 40 points impact (20 points less subtracted and 20 more added), positively influencing the health score, assuming no change in other factors like age and smoking status.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
