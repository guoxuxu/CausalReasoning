  "Explanation": "Manipulating the 'tax_bracket' to be 'lower' doesn't necessarily imply that no one meets the adult age condition; instead, it suggests that either the income is not above 50000 or the adult condition set by age is irrelevant due to the imposed intervention on 'tax_bracket'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
