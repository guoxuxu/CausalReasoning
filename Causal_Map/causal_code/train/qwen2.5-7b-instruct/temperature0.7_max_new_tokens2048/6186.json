  "Explanation": "Knowing only the product increase by a factor does not specify which of the variables 'a', 'b', or both were affected by the intervention. Either could have been increased, or both could have been altered in a way that their product magnifies by 5.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "If 'increaseValues(int)' is called with an argument of 5, then both 'a' and 'b' are increased by 5, which increases the 'product()' by a factor of 25. Given that the 'product()' increased by a factor of 5, it implies that either 'a' or 'b' was individually multiplied by 5, but not necessarily both."
