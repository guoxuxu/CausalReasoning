  "Explanation": "Increasing age is directly manipulated in the 'aging()' method which increases the risk score linearly (0.2 per year). Therefore, without any intervention, an increase in age will cause an increase in health risk.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
