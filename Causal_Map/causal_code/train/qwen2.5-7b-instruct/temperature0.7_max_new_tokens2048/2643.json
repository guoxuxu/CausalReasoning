  "Explanation": "An increase in 'score' could result from decreased 'error_count', an increase in 'age' crossing the bonus threshold, or the effect of a system upgrade. Thus, no certain inference about 'error_count' can be made without additional information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in 'score' can be inferred if 'error_count' decreases, given that 'bonus' is positively influenced by 'age > 2' and 'system_upgrade', while 'score' is inversely related to 'error_count'."
