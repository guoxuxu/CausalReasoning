  "Explanation": "Applying a zero discount rate simply retains the basePrice as the initial value for the finalPrice. When calculateTax is subsequently applied, the introduction of tax affects the finalPrice based on the unchanged basePrice, hence the prior application of a zero discount doesn’t alter the inevitability of a tax increase on the finalPrice.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Setting discountRate to 0 directly prevents any change to finalPrice from applyDiscount, ensuring finalPrice remains unaffected by subsequent calculateTax if discountRate is reset to 0 before tax calculation."
