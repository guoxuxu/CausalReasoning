  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, demand_factor, discount_applied):\n    base_price = price\n    if discount_applied:\n        price = price * 0.9  # 10% discount\n    demand = demand_factor * price\n    sales = price * demand\n    return sales\",\n\nIf the 'demand_factor' increases, will 'sales' increase assuming no changes to 'price' and 'discount_applied'?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the 'demand_factor' directly increases 'demand', which subsequently increases 'sales' because 'sales' is calculated as the product of 'demand' and 'price'. This increase occurs without any intervention in the 'price' or 'discount' status.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in demand_factor leads to an increase in sales, given that price remains constant. Similarly, a change in price affects sales."
