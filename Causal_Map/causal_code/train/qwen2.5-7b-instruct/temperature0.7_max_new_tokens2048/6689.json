  "Explanation": "The change in the condition to 'modified_data' > 10 makes it impossible to infer the original 'input_data' accurately, because any 'input_data' resulting in 'modified_data' greater than 10 (i.e., 'input_data' > 5) would now lead to True. Thus, we cannot conclude the specific range of the original 'input_data' without knowing its unmodified result.",

Changing the condition to modified_data > 10 from modified_data > 20 allows result to be True even when input_data is less than 10, indicating input_data must have been less than 10."
