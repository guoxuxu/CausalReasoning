  "Explanation": "Since forecasted sales increase either by reducing price or by temperature effect, if prices remain constant and forecasted sales increase, it can be inferred that the temperature has risen above 20 degrees, by the logic inherent in predict_sales method.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
