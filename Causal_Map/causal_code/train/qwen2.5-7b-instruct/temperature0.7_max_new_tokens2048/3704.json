  "Explanation": "If the time is set to 20 (after 18:00), the air conditioning will be turned off according to the code, regardless of the temperature. This is a causal inference with an intervention (setting the time), showing how the outcome changes when an intervening variable is manipulated.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
