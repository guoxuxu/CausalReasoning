  "Explanation": "According to the initial conditions in the constructor, the heating is set to be on if the initial temperature is below 20 degrees. Thus, with 15 degrees, the heating will be on.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
