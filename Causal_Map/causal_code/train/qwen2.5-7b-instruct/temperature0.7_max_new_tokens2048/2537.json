  "Explanation": "Using the 'adjust_humidity' method to increase the humidity level to 70 when the temperature is 25 (a scenario checked in the 'predict_precipitation' method where temperature above 20 and humidity over 65 results in rain) would indeed induce precipitation (rain).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
