  "Explanation": "The logging depends not only on 'error_log_enabled' but also on the status code of the request. Status codes below 500 and not equal to 404 in debug mode, will not generate a log even if 'error_log_enabled' is True.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
