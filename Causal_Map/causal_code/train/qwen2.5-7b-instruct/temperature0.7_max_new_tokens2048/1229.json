  "Explanation": "The `check_heater` function sets the `heater_on` attribute to true only if `current_temp` is less than `target_temp`. Therefore, if `heater_on` is true, it implies that `current_temp` was below `target_temp` when `check_heater` was called.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
