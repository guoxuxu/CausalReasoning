  "Explanation": "Increasing the temperature does not necessarily affect raining since raining depends on both the humidity being above 70 and the temperature being below 20. Increasing the temperature could potentially make it less likely to rain if the temperature was previously below 20 degrees.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
