  "Problem": "def complex_computation(x): \n    y = x * 2 \n    z = y + 3 \n    if z > 10: \n        result = z - 5 \n    else: \n        result = z + 5 \n    return result\",\n\nIf we adjust the equation of result to 'result = z' regardless of its size, and observe an unchanged result even when z increases, does this confirm if x increased?",
  "Explanation": "With the change in equation to result = z, variations in x still affect z, but observing an unchanged result while z increases is impossible under this fixed condition; if z remains unchanged, it means no effective change in y and thus x. However, any other external manipulation (like a forced offset compensation in y that nullifies x's increase) could alter it, though unlikely in this isolated context.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Increasing x leads to an increase in y, which in turn increases z. If z does not change when its value is used to determine the result (result = z), then x did not increase."
