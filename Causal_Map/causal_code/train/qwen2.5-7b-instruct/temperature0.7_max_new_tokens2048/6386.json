  "Explanation": "Improvement in health status to 'good' cannot solely be attributed to an increase in vitamin D levels without knowing more about changes in exercise frequency, which also plays a critical role in determining health status. Both factors are significant, but neither alone confirms the causation without information about the other.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
