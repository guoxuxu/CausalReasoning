  "Explanation": "A decrease in forecasted temperature can be due to increased days_ahead or increased humidity, as per the formula in forecast_temperature. Directly intervening to change humidity might alter the forecasted temperature, but a decrease in temperature could also stem from increasing the days_ahead, not specifically from humidity adjustments. Because other factors can cause similar effects, this does not hold uniquely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "A decrease in forecasted temperature does not necessarily indicate an increase in humidity with artificial interventions applied, as forecasted temperature is influenced by both temperature and humidity, while is_rainy depends on humidity levels."
