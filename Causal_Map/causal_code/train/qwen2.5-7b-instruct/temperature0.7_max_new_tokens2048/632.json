  "Explanation": "The unchanged 'value' state might also be a result of an external intervention that bypasses or counteracts the effect of the 'enhance' flag. Thus, just observing unmodified 'value' fields does not conclusively determine whether the 'enhance' flag was set to False, as these values might have been modified back to their original state by the intervention.",
