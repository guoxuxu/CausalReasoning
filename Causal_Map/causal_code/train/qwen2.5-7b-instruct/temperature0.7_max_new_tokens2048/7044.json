  "Problem": "{\n    \"description\": \"A program that calculates the final price of an item after sales discount and then adds tax.\",\n    \"code\": [\n      \"def calculate_discount(price, discount):\",\n      \"    return price * (1 - discount/100)\",\n      \"def apply_tax(price, tax_rate):\",\n      \"    return price * (1 + tax_rate/100)\",\n      \"def final_price(initial_price, discount_rate, tax_rate):\",\n      \"    discounted_price = calculate_discount(initial_price, discount_rate)\",\n      \"    final_amount = apply_tax(discounted_price, tax_rate)\",\n      \"    return final_amount\",\n      \"item_price = 120\",\n      \"discount = 15\",\n      \"tax = 8\",\n      \"result = final_price(item_price, discount, tax)\"\n    ]\n  },\n\nIf the final price equals the initial price, does this mean that both the discount and tax rates were zero?",
  "Explanation": "The final price equaling the initial price could also imply a scenario where the discount and increased tax counterbalance each other precisely, nullifying their effects (i.e., the percentage reduced by the discount is exactly offset by the percentage increased by the tax).",
