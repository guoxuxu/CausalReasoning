  "Problem": "def update_inventory(product_id, sold_units, returned_units):\n    inventory[product_id] = inventory.get(product_id, 0) - sold_units + returned_units\n\ninventory = {'A100': 150, 'A101': 200}\n\nupdate_inventory('A100', 10, 2)\nupdate_inventory('A101', 20, 5)\",\n\nIf we modify the function to ignore returned_units, will an increase in sold_units always reduce the inventory?",
  "Explanation": "Intervening to ignore returns means that the only factor affecting inventory levels is the number of units sold. Therefore, an increase in sold_units will directly lead to a reduction in inventory.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
