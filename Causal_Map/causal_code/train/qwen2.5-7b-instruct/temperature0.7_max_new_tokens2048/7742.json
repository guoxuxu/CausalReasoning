  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n    if 'age' in data: \n        age = data['age'] \n        if age > 30: \n            data['status'] = 'senior' \n        else: \n            data['status'] = 'junior' \n    if 'salary' in data and data['status'] == 'senior': \n        if data['salary'] > 50000: \n            data['category'] = 'high' \n    return data\",\n\nIf 'category' is 'high', can we assume the person's salary is greater than 50000?",
  "Explanation": "The code sets the 'category' to 'high' only when 'salary' is greater than 50000 and the 'status' is 'senior'. Thus, observing a 'high' category directly implies that salary exceeded 50000. This observation holds without intervention as it rests purely on internal conditional logic.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
