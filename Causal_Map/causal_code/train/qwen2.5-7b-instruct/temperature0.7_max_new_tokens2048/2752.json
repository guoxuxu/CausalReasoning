  "Explanation": "Setting the temperature to 5 degrees C while maintaining a humidity above 70% will increase the rain likelihood to 0.75 due to the analysis criterion within the code, which sets high rain likelihood under the condition of low temperature and high humidity.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
