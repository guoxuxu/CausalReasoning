  "Explanation": "If the `tax_bracket` changes from 'low' to 'high', it suggests that the `income` which initially qualified for the 'low' bracket (i.e., 30000 or less), must have increased above 30000. Although the exact initial income is unknown, we can infer that it was <= 30000 before an increase led to reclassification.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If the tax_bracket changes from 'low' to 'high', we can assume the income was initially at or below 30000, because a higher income above 30000 sets the tax_bracket to 'high'. Conversely, an income at or below 30000 keeps the tax_bracket at 'low'. Therefore, a change to 'high' implies the initial income was not exceeding 30000."
