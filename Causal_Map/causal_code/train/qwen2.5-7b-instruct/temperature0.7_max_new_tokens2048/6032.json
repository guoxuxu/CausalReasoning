  "Explanation": "While the decrease in healthLevel typically indicates that an event was triggered (thus increasing eventCount), it is crucial to know whether isActive is true. If isActive is false, healthLevel will not decrease regardless of eventCount, because triggerEvent() would not execute the decrement operation. Therefore, without knowing the state of isActive, a decrease in healthLevel does not necessarily imply an increase in eventCount.",
