  "Explanation": "While colder temperature (below 20 degrees) does lead to planning more indoor events due to rainy conditions, planning more indoor events does not conclusively indicate that the temperature is below 20. For instance, indoor events might be preferred for other reasons unrelated to weather conditions.",
