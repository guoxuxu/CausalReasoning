  "Explanation": "Based on the code, if a customer is unhappy, it can be inferred that they received service with a quality less than 4, as per the 'receive_service' method definition. Therefore, the effect (unhappiness) suggests the presence of its cause, poor service, even though intermediate quality service (4 to 7) would not affect their happiness status.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
