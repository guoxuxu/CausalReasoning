  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, discount, base_demand, economy_boost):\n    if discount >= 20:\n        demand_increase = 15\n    elif discount >= 10:\n        demand_increase = 10\n    else:\n        demand_increase = 5\n\n    adjusted_demand = base_demand + demand_increase\n    if economy_boost:\n        adjusted_demand *= 1.1\n\n    revenue = adjusted_demand * (price * (1 - (discount / 100)))\n    return revenue\",\n\nIf the 'revenue' increased significantly while the 'price' remained constant, did the 'base_demand' increase?",
  "Explanation": "With a constant price, a significant increase in revenue indicates an increase in the total units sold, which can be attributed to an increase in adjusted_demand. Since 'economy_boost' and 'discount' are not specified as changed, the likely factor contributing to the increase in demand would be the 'base_demand'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "If the base_demand increases, then adjusted_demand will increase, which can lead to an increase in revenue, assuming price and discount remain constant."
