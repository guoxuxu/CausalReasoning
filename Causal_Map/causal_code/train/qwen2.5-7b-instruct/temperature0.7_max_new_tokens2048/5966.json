  "Explanation": "The weather status 'Clear' implies it is not raining, but it does not necessarily mean that 'startRain()' was not invoked. The rain could have been started and then stopped by some other method not shown in the code snippet or manually adjusted back.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The 'isRaining' variable directly influences the 'weatherStatus()', and the 'temperature' variable also directly influences the 'weatherStatus()'. If 'isRaining' is false, the weather status will be 'Clear' unless the temperature is below 32, in which case it will be 'Snowing'. Therefore, seeing 'Clear' as the weather status implies that 'startRain()' was not invoked, assuming no other interventions change the temperature below 32 without raining."
