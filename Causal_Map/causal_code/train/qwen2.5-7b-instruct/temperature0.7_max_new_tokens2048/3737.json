  "Problem": "def update_sales(sales, quantity, promotion_active):\n    base_price = 20\n    threshold = 100\n    if promotion_active:\n        sales += 1.2 * quantity\n        if quantity > threshold:\n            discount = 0.1\n            sales -= discount * quantity\n    else:\n        sales += quantity\n        if quantity > threshold:\n            sales -= 5\n    return sales\",\n\nIf we observe an increase in sales, can we conclude promotions were activated?",
  "Explanation": "An increase in sales could be due simply to an increase in the quantity sold without promotions activated, or due to promotions. The sales increase alone without knowing quantity or the promotional status doesn't unequivocally indicate that promotions were activated.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Promotion activation and purchase quantity both positively influence sales. If promotions are active, sales increase by 1.2 times the quantity sold, with an additional discount for large quantities. If no promotion is active, sales simply equal the quantity sold, with a deduction for large quantities."
