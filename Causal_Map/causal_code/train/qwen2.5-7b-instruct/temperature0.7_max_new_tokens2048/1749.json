  "Explanation": "The increase in cleaned_data can be due to numerous factors like a higher mean or lower standard deviation in the original data_series. Without more information, we cannot conclusively determine that negative values were specifically filtered out.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
