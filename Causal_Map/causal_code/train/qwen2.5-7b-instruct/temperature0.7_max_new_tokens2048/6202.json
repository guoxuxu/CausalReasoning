  "Explanation": "Since the classification changed to 'high' following an intervention in science scores, it indicates that initially the student's science scores were inadequate for this high classification (i.e., below 85).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
