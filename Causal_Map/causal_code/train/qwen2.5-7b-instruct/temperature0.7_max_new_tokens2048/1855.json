  "Problem": "Described above in text section.\",\n\nIf a person manipulates the temperature to be 25 degrees and feels happy, will the activity necessarily be 'swimming'?",
  "Explanation": "Setting the temperature to 25 degrees will make the environment hot as per the set_environment function. If the mood is also set to 'happy', according to decide_activity, the chosen activity will be 'swimming', assuming no further details about available time affecting other conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Manipulating the temperature to 25 degrees can influence a person's activity, which in turn can affect their feeling happy. However, feeling happy does not necessarily mean the activity is swimming."
