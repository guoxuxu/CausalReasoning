  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, discount, base_demand, economy_boost):\n    if discount >= 20:\n        demand_increase = 15\n    elif discount >= 10:\n        demand_increase = 10\n    else:\n        demand_increase = 5\n\n    adjusted_demand = base_demand + demand_increase\n    if economy_boost:\n        adjusted_demand *= 1.1\n\n    revenue = adjusted_demand * (price * (1 - (discount / 100)))\n    return revenue\",\n\nIf the 'discount' is increased from 15 to 25, will the 'revenue' increase?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the discount from 15% to 25% increases the demand_increase from 10 to 15. However, it also results in a larger reduction in price per unit after the discount is applied. This price reduction can outweigh the effect of increased demand, leading to a potential decrease in overall revenue.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Increasing the discount from 15 to 25 will lead to a higher demand increase, which in turn increases the adjusted demand and, consequently, the revenue, assuming the base price and economic boost conditions remain unchanged."
