  "Problem": "def update_temperature(sensor_reading, adjustment_factor=1.05):\n    if sensor_reading > 100:\n        temperature = (sensor_reading * adjustment_factor) + 5\n    elif sensor_reading <= 100 and sensor_reading >= 50:\n        temperature = sensor_reading * adjustment_factor\n    else:\n        temperature = sensor_reading - 10\n    return temperature\n\nsensor_value = 110\nadjusted_temperature = update_temperature(sensor_value)\",\n\nIf you manually set the sensor_value to 150, will the adjusted_temperature be higher than the temperature at sensor_value 110?",
  "Explanation": "Manually setting the sensor_value to 150 forces the temperature calculation to apply for the reading > 100 scenario. At both sensor readings of 150 and 110, the formula applied is (sensor_reading * 1.05) + 5. Since 150 is greater than 110, after being multiplied by 1.05 and adding 5, the temperature will indeed be higher.",
