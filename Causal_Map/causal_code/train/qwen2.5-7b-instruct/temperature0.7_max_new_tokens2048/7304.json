  "Problem": "def calculate_co2_emissions(vehicle_type, miles_driven, fuel_efficiency):\n    if vehicle_type == 'electric':\n        emissions = 0\n    else:\n        emissions = miles_driven * (1 / fuel_efficiency) * 20\n    return emissions\",\n\nWould observing a decrease in 'emissions' indicate a reduction in 'miles_driven' if vehicle type and fuel efficiency remain constant?",
  "Explanation": "Given that vehicle type and fuel efficiency are constant, any observed change in 'emissions' must arise from changes in 'miles_driven'. The calculation of 'emissions' for non-electric vehicles ties directly to the magnitude of 'miles_driven'. Hence, a decrease in emissions leads us to conclude that 'miles_driven' has also decreased.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
