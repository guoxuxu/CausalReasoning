  "Explanation": "Altering the selling price per unit in the 'sellItem' method affects the budget increase formula (budget += pricePerUnit * quantity). Thus, by increasing the sale price, you directly influence the resulting increase in budget when items are sold.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
