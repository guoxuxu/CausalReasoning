  "Explanation": "A reduction in the number of patients may result in a decrease in the number of doctors through the manage_resources function if the total number falls below 30. This summarizes a feedback mechanism from the effect (patient count reduction) leading to a causal adjustment (decreasing doctor numbers).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
