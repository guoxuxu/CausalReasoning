  "Explanation": "Although heavy rain (more than 20mm) increases the traffic delay, it's not the sole cause; the presence of a special event also doubles the delay regardless of rain. Hence, increased traffic delay alone cannot conclusively indicate heavy rain.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If there was more than 20mm of rain, then traffic delay would be 1.5 times usual. Special events double the traffic delay. Observing more than usual traffic delay suggests more than 20mm of rain, but other factors like special events could also cause increased delay."
