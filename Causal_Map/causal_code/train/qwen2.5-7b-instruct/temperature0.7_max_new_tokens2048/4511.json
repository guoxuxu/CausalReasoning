  "Explanation": "When the temperature exceeds 20 degrees, the probability that it will rain decreases, as indicated by `this.isRaining = Math.random() > 0.7 ? true : false;`, which means there's only a 30% chance of rain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
