  "Explanation": "Changes in `processed_data` might be due to internal processing steps independent of changes in `data` (such as different filtering logic for 'age' or 'income' in the code). Thus, changes in `processed_data` do not necessarily imply changes in the original `data` list.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

The value of `item['income']` and `item['age']` directly cause the formation of `processed_data`. The value of `item['education']` directly causes the assignment of `item['status']`."
