  "Explanation": "A car being fuel efficient does not necessarily mean it will have an automatic transmission by default. The `apply_automatic_transmission` method needs to be explicitly called for the car to have the transmission applied. This is evidenced by the Car class, where the `has_automatic_transmission` attribute is set to True within the method, but this only applies if the method is called after initializing the car object.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
