  "Explanation": "The decision not to upgrade resources (need_upgrade is False) suggests that the load is within acceptable limits. However, this does not conclusively indicate that the server count was increased manually; the existing number of clients and servers could naturally sustain a load not exceeding the threshold.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If clients are between 10 and 30 inclusive, servers will be incremented by 1. This increment directly influences the server count, which in turn affects whether need_upgrade is set to True based on the load."
