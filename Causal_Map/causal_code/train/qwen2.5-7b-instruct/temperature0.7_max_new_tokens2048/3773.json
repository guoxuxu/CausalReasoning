  "Problem": "def calculate_health_index(age, diet_quality, exercise_freq):\n    if age > 50:\n        base_health_index = 70\n    else:\n        base_health_index = 90\n    diet_effect = diet_quality * 0.5\n    exercise_effect = exercise_freq * 1.2\n    health_index = base_health_index + diet_effect + exercise_effect\n    return health_index\",\n\nSuppose a significant increase in health_index is observed after physical exercise intervention; does this confirm that the person was exercising inadequately before?",
  "Explanation": "While increased exercise_frequency positively affects the health_index, stating the previous insufficiency only based on an increase is speculative without prior data on their exercise habits. Other factors like diet could have also been altered or were previously compensating.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in exercise frequency can lead to an increase in health index. Age determines the base health index, and diet quality affects the diet effect component of the health index."
