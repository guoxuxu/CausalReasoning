  "Explanation": "Manually setting 'quantity' does not influence the conditional operation on the 'flag'. The 'flag' value strictly determines the operation within the function, independant of any manual setups outside the function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Manually setting 'quantity' in the 'data' dictionary to any value will make 'flag' irrelevant for changing 'price', as 'flag' is only used to modify 'price'. When 'flag' is False, 'data['quantity']' is incremented by 10, not 'data['price']'. Therefore, setting 'quantity' does not directly cause a change in 'price' when 'flag' is False."
