  "Problem": "def calculate_health(diet_quality, exercise_freq):\n    if diet_quality > 7 and exercise_freq >= 3:\n        health_status = 'Excellent'\n    elif diet_quality > 5 or exercise_freq >= 2:\n        health_status = 'Good'\n    else:\n        health_status = 'Poor'\n    return health_status\",\n\nSuppose we observe that health_status changed from 'Good' to 'Excellent' after an intervention. Can we conclude the intervention improved diet_quality necessarily?",
  "Explanation": "The improvement might be due to an increase in either diet_quality or exercise_freq or both. Changing one of these factors or both could result in health_status improving; hence, we cannot uniquely attribute the change to diet_quality alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
