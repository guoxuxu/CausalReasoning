Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If it is after 18:00, then it is raining and the temperature decreases by 5. Since being rainy causes 'Rainy and cool' weather status, and the temperature drop is a consequence of it being after 18:00, it follows that if the weather status is 'Rainy and cool', it must be after 18:00."
