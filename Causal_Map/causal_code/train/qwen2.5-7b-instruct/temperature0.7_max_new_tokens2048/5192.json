  "Explanation": "The 'remove_item' function checks whether the item exists and that the quantity to remove is less than or equal to the quantity currently held. If the condition to check quantity is faulty or the quantity is not updated correctly, it would prevent the code inside the 'if' clause from executing that subtracts the quantity or deletes the item.",
