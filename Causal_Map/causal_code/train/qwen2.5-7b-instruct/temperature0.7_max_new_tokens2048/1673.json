  "Explanation": "In this intervened scenario, every even number from 'data_list' adds 2 instead of 1, leading to output numbers that are exactly one unit higher for each even number compare to the original implementation. Thus, the results for even numbers are guaranteed to be greater.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If a number is even, it is transformed into that number plus two; if a number is odd, it remains unchanged minus one. Changing even numbers to be plus two ensures the final result contains greater numbers for even inputs compared to adding one."
