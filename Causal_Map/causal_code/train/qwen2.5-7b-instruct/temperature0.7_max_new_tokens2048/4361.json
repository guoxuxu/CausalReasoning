  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator { int temperature; int humidity; boolean isRaining; void simulateWeather(int seed) { Random rand = new Random(seed); temperature = rand.nextInt(20) + 10; humidity = temperature > 25 ? 80 : 40; isRaining = humidity > 50 && rand.nextBoolean(); }}\",\n\nDoes initializing the random seed consistently lead to the same temperature?",
  "Explanation": "The temperature is directly determined by the seed passed to Random.nextInt(), so using the same seed will generate the same sequence of random numbers, hence the same temperature output, assuming no other intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Initializing the random seed leads to the same temperature because the temperature is determined by the seed, and temperature influences humidity but not directly repeating the seed's effect."
