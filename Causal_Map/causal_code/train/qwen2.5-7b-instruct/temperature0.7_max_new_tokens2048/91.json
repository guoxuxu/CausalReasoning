  "Explanation": "The `marketing_effect` function increases the demand by 20% if there is a marketing campaign active, independent of other factors like weather or holiday. Holding those factors constant, initiating a marketing campaign will unequivocally increase the final_demand.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
