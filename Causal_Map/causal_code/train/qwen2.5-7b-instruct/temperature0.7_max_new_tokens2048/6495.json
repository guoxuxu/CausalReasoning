  "Explanation": "Since data_samples undergo a normalization and are then transformed logarithmically in the `process_data` function, higher initial values would result in higher normalized values. Given that the transformation increases the range, higher inputs directly translate to higher outputs, leading to a larger count of results exceeding the threshold in `evaluate_model`. This is a typical 'cause to effect without intervention' scenario.",
