  "Explanation": "The 'tax_bracket' being 'higher' directly depends on both having 'income' greater than 50000 and being an 'adult' set to True. Since the 'adult' field is only set to True if 'age' is greater than 18, a person in the 'higher' tax bracket must necessarily be over 18.",

Since being an adult requires being over 18, and having a 'higher' tax bracket implies an income over 50000 and being an adult, a person with a 'higher' tax bracket must be over 18."
