  "Explanation": "In the `decide_activity` function, the planned activity directly depends on the weather condition; a sunny weather leads to planning a picnic, while rainy weather changes it to watching movies. Therefore, any change in the weather condition results in a change of the planned activity.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
