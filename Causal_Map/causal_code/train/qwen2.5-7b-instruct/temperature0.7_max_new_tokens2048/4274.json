  "Problem": "def process_data(data, switch): \n  if switch: \n    data = [x * 2 for x in data] \n  else: \n    data = [x / 2 for x in data] \n  result = sum(data) \n  if result > 50: \n    status = 'high' \n  else: \n    status = 'low' \n  return status, result\",\n\nIf the variable 'switch' is set to True, will the 'result' variable necessarily be higher than it would be if 'switch' were False?",
  "Explanation": "The final value of 'result' depends on both the operation applied to the data (multiplication by 2 or division by 2) and the initial values of the data. Multiplying by 2 could lead to a larger sum than dividing, but if the initial values are small or zero, the result may still not exceed those from dividing larger numbers.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "When 'switch' is True, 'dataTransformation' involves doubling each element in 'data', potentially leading to a higher 'result' compared to when 'switch' is False, which divides each element by two. The 'result' influences 'status', determining whether it is 'high' or 'low'."
