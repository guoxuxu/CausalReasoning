  "Explanation": "Lower final_prices could indeed be influenced by a higher loyalty score which results in higher discount rates. However, it is not the only possible explanation - the original prices themselves could have been lower, or the computation logic in the code could potentially be modified elsewhere. Without explicit knowledge of the loyalty score or discount rates, a definitive causal inference cannot be made.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
