  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator { void simulateRain(boolean humidityHigh, boolean cloudsFormed) { if (humidityHigh && cloudsFormed) { System.out.println('It rains.'); } else { System.out.println('No rain.'); } } public static void main(String[] args) { WeatherSimulator weather = new WeatherSimulator(); weather.simulateRain(true, true); } }\",\n\nIf an external mechanism confirmed it had rained, can we assume clouds formation was externally induced?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific evidence of intervention in the cloud forming process (the code itself doesn't assume external intervention), raining does not provide strong evidence that clouds were necessarily formed by external intervention—a natural occurrence adhering to programmed conditions can also cause rain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
