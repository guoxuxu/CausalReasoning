  "Explanation": "Increasing the initial inventory in the constructor of the OnlineStore class would allow larger orders to be fulfilled. Having a higher starting inventory means that unless the order quantity exceeds this new higher inventory, the purchase will be fulfilled.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Increasing inventory_amount allows for the fulfillment of purchase orders (order_quantity ≤ inventory_amount), while a larger order_quantity reduces the chances of fulfillment if inventory_amount is insufficient."
