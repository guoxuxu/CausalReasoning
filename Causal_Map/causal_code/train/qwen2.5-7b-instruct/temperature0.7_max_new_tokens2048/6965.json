  "Problem": "{\n    \"description\": \"This Python code simulates a simplified ecosystem where plants grow based on sunlight and water availability. Herbivores eat the plants and are also affected by the presence of predators.\",\n    \"code\": \"sunlight = 5\nwater = 3\nplants = sunlight * 2 + water\ncount_herbivores = (plants - 5) // 2 if plants > 5 else 0\ncount_predators = 1 if count_herbivores > 5 else 0\n\",\n    \"variables\": {\n      \"sunlight\": \"Amount of sunlight, affects plant growth linearly.\",\n      \"water\": \"Amount of water, affects plant growth linearly.\",\n      \"plants\": \"Total plant growth, affected by sunlight and water.\",\n      \"count_herbivores\": \"Number of herbivores, based on plant availability.\",\n      \"count_predators\": \"Number of predators, depends on the number of herbivores.\"\n    }\n  },\n\nIf we see a decrease in the number of herbivores, can we conclude that the number of plants was reduced?",
  "Explanation": "While it's true that fewer plants can lead to fewer herbivores, the presence or increase of predators (or other factors not included in the code) could also reduce the number of herbivores independently from plant numbers.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
