  "Problem": "class HealthMonitor { int age; bool hasHighBP; public: HealthMonitor(int a, bool hbp) : age(a), hasHighBP(hbp) {} bool riskOfHeartDisease() { return age > 50 && hasHighBP; }} int main() { HealthMonitor patient1(55, true); bool isAtRisk = patient1.riskOfHeartDisease(); return isAtRisk ? 1 : 0; }\",\n\nUnder the intervention where the riskOfHeartDisease function return is set to true, does learning the patient's hasHighBP status provide information about their age?",
  "Explanation": "When we intervene to ensure the riskOfHeartDisease function returns true, we are essentially ensuring both conditions (age over 50 and high blood pressure) are met. Knowing whether or not the patient has high blood pressure does not provide additional information about their age since the intervention guarantees the age is already over 50 to satisfy the function's conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
