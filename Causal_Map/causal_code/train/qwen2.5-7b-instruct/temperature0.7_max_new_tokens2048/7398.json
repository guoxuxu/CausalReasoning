  "Explanation": "Observing that rain is false does not let us conclude with certainty that the temperature is above 80. Rain being false could also have been directly caused by the new_rain_condition set within the method, independent of temperature changes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
