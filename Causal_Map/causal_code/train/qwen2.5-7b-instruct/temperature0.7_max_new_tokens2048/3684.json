  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n  adjusted_data = data ** 2\n  result = adjusted_data * 5\n  return result\n\nvalue = 10\nprocessed_value = process_data(value)\nprint(processed_value)\",\n\nIf a new step in 'process_data' multiplies 'adjusted_data' by a constant different from 5, will the relationship between 'value' and 'processed_value' remain the same?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing a change in the scaling factor inside 'process_data' directly affects how 'processed_value' is computed from 'value'. Altering this factor changes the relationship by modifying how much the squared 'value' is scaled before being returned, thus changing the output for any given input.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value is transformed through squaring to become adjusted_data, which then gets multiplied by 5 to produce result, and finally, result becomes processed_value. If adjusted_data is multiplied by a different constant, the relationship between value and processed_value will change."
