  "Explanation": "While increasing the price of one item can contribute to an overall increase in average sale price, the increase could equally result from changes in other sales prices or higher-priced new entries in the sales data. Thus, the effect can't be solely attributed to the use of `increaseTargetSales` on one item.",
