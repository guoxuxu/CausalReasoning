  "Explanation": "Even though the sales tax rate increases, applying a proportionally larger discount can reduce the net outlay, hence lowering the final price. The balance of the increased tax burden against a greater reduction via discount can indeed result in a reduced final payment.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
