  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, quantity, discount_rate=0.1, tax_rate=0.2):\n    discount = price * quantity * discount_rate\n    tax = (price * quantity - discount) * tax_rate\n    total_sales = (price * quantity - discount) + tax\n    return total_sales\",\n\nIf we intervene and set the discount rate to zero, will an increase in the price directly lead to higher total sales?",
  "Explanation": "Setting the discount rate to zero means that the discount term in the total sales calculation becomes zero. Under this condition, an increase in the price will directly increase the total sales, because the negative effect of discounts is eliminated, and each unit sold contributes more to the base sales amount, which is then taxed. Thus, increased price leads to increased tax and increased total sales.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
