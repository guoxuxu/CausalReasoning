  "Explanation": "Modification to 'bonus' value, even through external policy, does not impact the determination of 'high_performer' status. 'high_performer' is solely determined by sales figures, independent of bonus modifications.",

  "causal_map_integration": "If sales are greater than 100000, then high_performer is True; otherwise, high_performer is False. bonus depends on high_performer and years_of_service. An external policy increases bonus by 2000, which may change the value of bonus but does not directly affect high_performer determination."
