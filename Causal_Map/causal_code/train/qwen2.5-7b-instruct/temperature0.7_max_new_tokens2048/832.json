  "Problem": "class Experiment { int temp; double reactionRate; void increaseTemp() { temp += 5; if (temp > 100) reactionRate *= 2; else reactionRate += 10; } void decreaseReaction() { if (reactionRate > 20) { reactionRate -= 5; temp -= 3; } } }\",\n\nIf the temperature of the experiment goes above 100, will the reaction rate necessarily double?",
  "Explanation": "In the method 'increaseTemp()', there is a conditional statement which checks if the temperature exceeds 100. If it does, the reaction rate is doubled. Therefore, if the condition of the temperature exceeding 100 is met, the reaction rate will inevitably double.",
