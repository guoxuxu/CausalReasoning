  "Explanation": "Turning off the heater is an intervention that does not necessarily reflect the current state of `current_temp` relative to `target_temp`. The heater could be turned off manually regardless of the temperatures' comparison. Therefore, this action does not imply a causal effect from `current_temp` changes.",
