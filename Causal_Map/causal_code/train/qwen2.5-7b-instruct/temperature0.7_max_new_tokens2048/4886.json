  "Explanation": "Although intervening exercise to high can reduce the risk score, a decrease in the health risk score can also result from other factors or interventions, such as aging or smoking cessation interventions. Thus, it cannot be definitively concluded without more information that a risk decrease was due to the exercise intervention alone.",
