  "Problem": "def compute_sales(discount, quantity, base_price):\n\\tif discount > 0:\n\\t\\tfinal_price = base_price * (1 - discount / 100)\n\\telse:\n\\t\\tfinal_price = base_price\n\\ttotal_sales = final_price * quantity\n\\tsurplus = total_sales * 0.05\n\\treturn total_sales, surplus\n\nsales, extra = compute_sales(10, 50, 20)\",\n\nIf we fix the discount at a higher rate, is it likely that the total sales value will drop?",
  "Explanation": "Fixing the discount at a higher rate lowers unit prices which might actually increase sales volume, potentially compensating for or exceeding the loss in revenue per unit leading to stable or increased total sales values. The intervention increases consumer incentive to purchase more.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "When the discount rate increases, the final price decreases, which leads to a decrease in total sales."
