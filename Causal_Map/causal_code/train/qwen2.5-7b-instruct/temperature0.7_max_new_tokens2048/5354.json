  "Explanation": "The ranking in the sorted results is influenced by the scores, but the scenario does not necessarily imply that Charlie's individual weights were adjusted. The weight adjustment described applies universally to all data points, not selectively to Charlie. The ranking would be determined by the actual values and the overall weighting applied to everyone's data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
