  "Problem": "class Car:\n    def __init__(self, model, year):\n        self.model = model\n        self.year = year\n        self.speed = 0\n\n    def accelerate(self, increment):\n        self.speed += increment\n        if self.speed > 120:\n            self.speed = 120\n\n    def brake(self, decrement):\n        self.speed -= decrement\n        if self.speed < 0:\n            self.speed = 0\",\n\nIf the car's speed reads 0, can we infer that the brake method was recently activated?",
  "Explanation": "A speed reading of 0 could imply that either the car has not been accelerated (speed was never increased from its initial state), or that the brake method was called to reduce the speed to 0. Thus, a reading of 0 alone does not necessarily indicate that the brake method was used without additional context or information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Braking decreases the car's speed, while accelerating increases it. The current speed is a result of recent braking or accelerating actions."
