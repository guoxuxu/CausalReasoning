  "Explanation": "During `simulate_day`, `increase_temp` is called with a delta of 5, which always increases the temperature by 5 degrees. This direct method call within `simulate_day` ensures that the temperature will increase, showing a clear cause-effect relationship without external interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
