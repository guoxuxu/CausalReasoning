  "Explanation": "The code directly links the activation of the cloud system to the 'cloudy' condition being true. There are no other conditions leading to the activation of the cloud system in the given code.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
