  "Explanation": "Although calling setTrafficLightGreen() will make checkIfTrafficIsAllowed() return true, the initial value of isGreen might also be directly manipulated elsewhere in the class, or the light might have been set to green by operateTrafficLight method with true action. Thus, a true result from checkIfTrafficIsAllowed() doesn't definitively imply setTrafficLightGreen() was called.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "setTrafficLightGreen() directly changes isGreen, and checkIfTrafficIsAllowed() depends on the current value of isGreen. operateTrafficLight(true) calls setTrafficLightGreen(), while operateTrafficLight(false) sets isGreen to false."
