  "Explanation": "The `calculate_demand` function sets higher base demand for sunny weather (120) compared to rainy (80) without considering other variables like holiday or marketing campaign. Thus, changing the weather to rainy will reduce the base demand irrespective of any interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Changes in weather directly affect base_demand. Sunny weather increases base_demand to 120, rainy weather decreases it to 80, and snowy weather further decreases it to 50. Weather also indirectly affects holidays, but the primary impact is on base_demand."
