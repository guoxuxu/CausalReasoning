  "Explanation": "Inventory reduction might be caused by selling the product, but there might also be other operations affecting inventory (such as theft, loss, or untracked sales) which are not detailed in the code. Without explicit intervention or observation of the 'sell_product' call, the inference is not necessarily correct.",
