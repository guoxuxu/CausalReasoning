  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(price, coupon_code):\n    discount = 0\n    if coupon_code == 'SAVE20':\n        discount = 0.2\n    elif coupon_code == 'OFF10':\n        discount = 0.1\n    final_price = price * (1 - discount)\n    return final_price\",\n\nSuppose a new $20 flat reduction is applied before applying the coupon code 'OFF10'. Will the original discount rate increase?",
  "Explanation": "The discount rate remains at 10% regardless of additional flat price reductions. The rate is hard-coded and does not alter with changes to the pre-discount price.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
