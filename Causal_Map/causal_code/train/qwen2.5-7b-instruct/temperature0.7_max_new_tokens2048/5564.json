  "Explanation": "The code explicitly sets need_upgrade to True only if the load (clients divided by servers) exceeds 5. Therefore, seeing need_upgrade set to True directly infers that the server to client ratio was indeed greater than 5.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If clients exceed 30, servers increase by 2; if clients are less than 10, servers decrease by 1; otherwise, servers increase by 1. The client-to-server ratio determines the load, which in turn decides whether an upgrade is needed."
