  "Explanation": "The safety alert becomes active when the heater is on and the temp setting is over 25. However, there can be cases where the env_temp being significantly low automatically turns on the heater without manual intervention, thus activating a safety alert if the setting happens to be adjusted above 25 anytime prior. Here, with a setting below 25, if a safety alert is active, it doesn't conclusively indicate manual intervention but rather an error in assumptions about settings or environmental temperature.",
