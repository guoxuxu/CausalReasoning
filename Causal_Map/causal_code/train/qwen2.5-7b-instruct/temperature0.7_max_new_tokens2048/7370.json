  "Explanation": "Good growth can result from either 'rainy' weather or when water is 'no water needed' due to rainy conditions, but it can also occur if water conditions are appropriately managed (e.g., no water needed due to prior conditions not specified or other unseen interventions). Thus, good growth alone does not definitively signal recent rain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
