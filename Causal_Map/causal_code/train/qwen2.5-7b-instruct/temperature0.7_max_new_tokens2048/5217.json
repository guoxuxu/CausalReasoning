  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulation { constructor(weather) { this.weather = weather; } changeWeather(newWeather) { this.weather = newWeather; } getChanceOfRain() { return this.weather === 'rainy' ? 0.9 : this.weather === 'cloudy' ? 0.5 : 0.1; } isWeatherGoodForHiking() { const chanceOfRain = this.getChanceOfRain(); return chanceOfRain < 0.5; } }\",\n\nIf an intervention sets the weather to 'sunny', will the method report the weather as good for hiking?",
  "Explanation": "Setting the weather to 'sunny' reduces the chance of rain to 0.1 via 'getChanceOfRain'. Since 'isWeatherGoodForHiking' evaluates the weather as good for hiking if the chance of rain is below 0.5, this intervention (setting weather as 'sunny') will effectively result in the method reporting that it is indeed good for hiking. This shows a direct manipulation (intervention) of the cause leading to the desired effect.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
