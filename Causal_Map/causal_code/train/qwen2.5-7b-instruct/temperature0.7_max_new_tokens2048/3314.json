  "Explanation": "The effectiveness of the marketing campaign is a function of its budget among other factors. Increasing the budget increases the effectiveness directly by the formula given in calculate_effectiveness(), consequently increasing the total sales computed in calculate_sales(). This is a direct cause-effect relationship without intervening.",
