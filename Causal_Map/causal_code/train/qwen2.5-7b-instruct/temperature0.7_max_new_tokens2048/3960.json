  "Explanation": "Setting John's age to 17 will result in John not having a driving license (based on the check_driving_license condition of being at least 18 years old). This lack of a license will make his application for a driver job unsuccessful.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
