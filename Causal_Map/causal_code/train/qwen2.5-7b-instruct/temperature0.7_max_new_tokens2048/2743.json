  "Explanation": "Given the heating system is reported as 'on', it suggests, based on the control logic, that the cause (current temperature < 20) had occurred. However, there might be alternative explanations if additional conditions or errors are within the system, but given only the provided code, this inference is valid.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
