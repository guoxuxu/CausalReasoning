  "Explanation": "According to the 'willGetWet' method, a person only stays dry (does not get wet) either if it is not raining ('isRaining' is false) or they have taken an umbrella ('umbrellaTaken' is true). Thus, not getting wet implies the existence of at least one of these conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
