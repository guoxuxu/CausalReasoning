  "Explanation": "Setting weather_condition directly (if it were allowed, which the provided code does not support) to 'Tropical' does not inherently change temperature or humidity. Moreover, since weather_condition is the result of conditions involving both temperature and humidity, just observing 'Tropical' doesn’t guarantee both were set previously above specific thresholds without knowing prior values or further context.",
