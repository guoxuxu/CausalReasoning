  "Explanation": "The function 'cleanse_data' deals with missing ages by filling them with the mean age. By modifying this intervention to fill with a specific value above 30, it increases the overall mean age, hence the classification in 'analyze' would more likely be 'Adult'. This is a clear case of manipulating a cause and observing its effect.",
