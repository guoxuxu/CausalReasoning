  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(price, coupon_code):\n    discount = 0\n    if coupon_code == 'SAVE20':\n        discount = 0.2\n    elif coupon_code == 'OFF10':\n        discount = 0.1\n    final_price = price * (1 - discount)\n    return final_price\",\n\nIf the price of an item is increased from $100 to $200 with coupon code 'SAVE20', will the final price also be doubled?",
  "Explanation": "Since 'SAVE20' provides a 20% discount, the final price will not be doubled. It will be $160 after discount when the price is $200, which is not twice the final price of $80 when the price is $100.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
