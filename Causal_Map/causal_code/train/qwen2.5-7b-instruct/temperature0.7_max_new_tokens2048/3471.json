  "Explanation": "Without additional information about the tax rate and discount, the final price alone isn't sufficient to pinpoint the exact base price as multiple combinations of base price, discount, and tax can lead to the same final price.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The base price determines the discounted price, which then influences the tax amount and ultimately the final price. The tax rate affects the tax amount independently. The final price is the sum of the discounted price and the tax amount."
