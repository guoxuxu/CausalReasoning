  "Problem": "class Store {\n  private int customers = 0;\n  private int sales = 0;\n  \n  public void enterCustomer(int number) {\n    this.customers += number;\n  }\n\n  public void makeSale(int soldItems) {\n    this.sales += soldItems;\n  }\n\n  public int getCustomers() {\n    return this.customers;\n  }\n\n  public int getSales() {\n    return this.sales;\n  }\n\n  public void promotionalEvent(int discountRate) {\n    if (discountRate > 20) {\n      this.customers += 10;\n      this.sales += 50;\n    }\n  }\n}\",\n\nIf the store runs a promotional event with a high discount rate, will there be an increase in the number of customers?",
  "Explanation": "The promotional event method includes logic to increase the number of customers by 10 if the discount rate is greater than 20%. This represents a direct causal intervention where the promotional event (cause) directly leads to an increase in customers (effect).",
