  "Explanation": "To lead directly to 'Normal conditions', the temperature must be neither below zero nor so high that it, combined with any humidity conditions, would trigger other alerts. If the temperature were below zero, adjusting humidity alone wouldn't be enough to result in 'Normal conditions'; it would potentially result in 'Low temperature' or 'High risk of frost'. Thus, the temperature must have been above zero for an adjustment in humidity to directly result in 'Normal conditions'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
