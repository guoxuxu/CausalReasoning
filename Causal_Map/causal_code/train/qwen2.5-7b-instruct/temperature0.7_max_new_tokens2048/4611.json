  "Explanation": "In the given code, the market condition is determined by the weather. If the weather is sunny, the market condition is 'good', resulting in a base sales volume of 100, as opposed to 50 in bad conditions. Thus, sunny weather directly causes higher sales volumes without any interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
