  "Explanation": "After shipping 50 units, the stock level is at 50. The intervention of checking the stock if it is above 50 before receiving new stock would prevent any stock increase since the condition is exactly 50, which does not exceed the limit set. This tests the impact of an intervening rule or condition on the consequent stock level.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If the stock is greater than or equal to the quantity shipped, the order status is true, which allows receiving new stock only if the stock is less than 51."
