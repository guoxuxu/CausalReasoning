  "Problem": "class WeatherStation { float temperature = 25.0; boolean isRaining = false; void updateWeather(float newTemp, boolean rainStatus) { temperature = newTemp; isRaining = rainStatus; } float getTemperature() { return temperature; } boolean getRainStatus() { return isRaining; } } WeatherStation station = new WeatherStation(); station.updateWeather(30.0, true); float currentTemp = station.getTemperature(); boolean currentRainStatus = station.getRainStatus();\",\n\nIf we intervene by directly modifying the 'temperature' attribute of the WeatherStation instance to 28.0 degrees, will a subsequent call to 'getTemperature' return 28.0 degrees?",
  "Explanation": "Although direct modification of attributes is not shown in the original snippet, if there were access to modify the 'temperature' attribute directly, setting it to 28.0 degrees would mean that 'getTemperature' would return 28.0 degrees as it just returns the current value of the 'temperature' attribute.",
