  "Explanation": "The method `willRainSoon` states rain is expected when humidity exceeds 85 and temperature is below 20, but if the temperature is already below 20, increased humidity can be a cause but not a necessary implication. Rain prediction might not imply observed increase in humidity if humidity was already above the threshold.",
