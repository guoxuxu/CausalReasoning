  "Explanation": "With a subtraction of 5, an input greater than 12.5 becomes greater than 7.5 after this step. When doubled, the data exceeds 15, and to get a True result (which requires the data to double to beyond 20), the original input needs to be indeed greater than 12.5.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
