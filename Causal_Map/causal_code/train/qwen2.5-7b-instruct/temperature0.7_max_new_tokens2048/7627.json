  "Explanation": "Setting the 'factor' to a high value will indeed increase the 'adjusted' value; however, the final 'status' still depends on the 'adjusted' being greater than 100. If the 'raw' value is extremely low, even a high 'factor' might not raise the 'adjusted' above 100. So, we can't guarantee 'high' status without knowing the 'raw' value.",
