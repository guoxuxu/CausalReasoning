  "Explanation": "An increase in current_sales directly contributes to forecasted_sales calculation by the relation 'forecasted_sales = base_sales + (monthly_sales * 0.5) + ...'. Here, as the current_sales (acting as monthly_sales in the function) increases, forecasted_sales will increase proportionally due to multiplying by 0.5.",
