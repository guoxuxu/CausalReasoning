  "Explanation": "From effect to cause with intervention - Setting the weight to less than 100 kg directly affects the heart rate calculation independent of age. Thus, changes in heart rate cannot be directly attributed to changes in age if the weight condition is consistently altered or controlled, leaving the causal pathway from age ambiguous.",
