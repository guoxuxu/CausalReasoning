  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator {\n    int temperature;\n    int humidity;\n    boolean isRaining;\n\n    WeatherSimulator(int temperature, int humidity) {\n        this.temperature = temperature;\n        this.humidity = humidity;\n        this.isRaining = checkRain();\n    }\n\n    boolean checkRain() {\n        return temperature < 20 && humidity > 70;\n    }\n\n    void changeWeather(int newTemp, int newHumid) {\n        this.temperature = newTemp;\n        this.humidity = newHumid;\n        this.isRaining = checkRain();\n    }\n}\n\nWeatherSimulator todayWeather = new WeatherSimulator(15, 80);\nboolean willItRain = todayWeather.isRaining;\",\n\nIf it is raining, can we conclude the temperature is below 20?",
  "Explanation": "While the condition for raining includes the temperature being below 20, it also requires that humidity is above 70. Raining infers both conditions are met, not just one. Therefore, knowing it is raining doesn't solely determine that the temperature is below 20 unless humidity information is also known.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
