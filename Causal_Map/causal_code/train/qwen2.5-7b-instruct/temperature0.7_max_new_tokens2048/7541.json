  "Explanation": "Turning on the air purifier without cleaning its dirty filter will not result in good air quality because the `check_air_quality` method confirms that both conditions, `is_on` and `not filter_dirty`, must be true for the air quality to be 'Good'. If the filter remains dirty, the air quality will still be 'Poor'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
