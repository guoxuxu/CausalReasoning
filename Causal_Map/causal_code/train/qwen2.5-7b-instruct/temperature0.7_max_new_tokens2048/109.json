  "Explanation": "In the given scenario, if the demand increases while the supply remains constant, the condition 'supply > demand' in the code would not hold, leading to the 'else' block execution where the adjustment_factor is increased by multiplying it by 1.1. Consequently, an increase in demand with unchanged supply results in an increase in the adjustment_factor.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
