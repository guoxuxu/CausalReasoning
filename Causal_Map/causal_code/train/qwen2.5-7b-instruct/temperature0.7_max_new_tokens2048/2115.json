  "Explanation": "The adjust_heart_rate function increases the heart rate linearly with the exercise level until a certain point after which the increase rate itself gets boosted. This direct modification relationship classifies the causal interaction from cause (exercise_level) to effect (heart_rate) without any external intervention.",
