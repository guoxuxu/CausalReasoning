  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(cart_items, promo_code): \n    total = sum(item['price'] * item['quantity'] for item in cart_items) \n    discount = 0 \n    if promo_code == 'SAVE10': \n        discount = total * 0.10 \n    elif promo_code == 'SAVE20': \n        discount = total * 0.20 \n    net_price = total - discount \n    return net_price\",\n\nDoes observing a change in 'net_price' necessarily imply that 'promo_code' was applied?",
  "Explanation": "A change in 'net_price' could result from either applying a promo code or changes in the 'cart_items' themselves (such as changes in quantity or price), or both. Hence, a change in 'net_price' alone does not confirm the application of a promo code.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The promo_code directly influences net_price through its effect on discount, which is calculated based on total. Changes in cart_items affect total, which in turn affects both discount and net_price."
