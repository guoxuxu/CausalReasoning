  "Explanation": "Not necessarily; the removal of the need for cooling could be due solely to the reduction in CPU usage since both high CPU use or high temperature can individually trigger the cooling requirement.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "High CPU usage or high temperature can cause the system to be overloaded, which in turn may require cooling. Directly reducing CPU usage to 50% and eliminating the need for cooling suggests that the initial overload was likely due to high temperature, as CPU usage was not excessively high."
