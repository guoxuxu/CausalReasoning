  "Explanation": "The activation of the cooling system does not necessarily imply that the initial temperature was above 25 degrees, as the temperature might have been increased just enough by the adjustment to exceed 25 degrees.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
