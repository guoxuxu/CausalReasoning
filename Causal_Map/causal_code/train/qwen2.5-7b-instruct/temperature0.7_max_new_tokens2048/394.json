  "Problem": "def process_data(input_data): \n    modified_data = input_data * 2 \n    final_data = modified_data + 10 \n    return final_data \n\nuser_input = 20 \nresult = process_data(user_input)\",\n\nIf final_data is observed to decrease, can we infer that user_input has definitely decreased without any changes to the process_data function?",
  "Explanation": "Since the function process_data linearly depends on the user_input (double the input, add 10), a decrease in final_data directly implies a decrease in user_input, provided that the process_data function remains unchanged.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
