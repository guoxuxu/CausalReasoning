  "Explanation": "Manually reducing the temperature would affect the method rain, as rain decreases temperature further if humidity is above 70. However, reducing temperature would not influence the heat_wave method's threshold condition (temperature > 30) to decrease humidity, as it is purely dependent on the initial state of temperature.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Manually reducing the temperature will decrease the likelihood of the heat_wave method being triggered, as a higher temperature is a prerequisite for the heat_wave method to reduce humidity. Additionally, decreasing the temperature may increase the effectiveness of the rain method, which can lower the temperature further."
