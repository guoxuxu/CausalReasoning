  "Problem": "def compute_leaves_health(season, rain_inches, use_fertilizer):\n    if season == 'spring':\n        health = 70\n    elif season == 'summer':\n        health = 50\n    else:\n        health = 30\n    health += rain_inches * 2\n    if use_fertilizer:\n        health += 20\n    return health\",\n\nIf we manually adjust rain_inches to be much higher than usual, will this cause leaf health to increase, assuming no other factors change?",
  "Explanation": "The code directly increases health based on the product of rain_inches and 2. By increasing rain_inches, the multiplication factor evidently raises the total health score, assuming other conditions like season and fertilizer use remain constant.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
