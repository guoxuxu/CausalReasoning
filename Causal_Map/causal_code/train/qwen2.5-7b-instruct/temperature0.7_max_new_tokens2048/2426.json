  "Problem": "\n    sales = [100, 200, 150, 300]\n    prices = [20, 15, 18, 10]\n    discount_events = [0, 1, 0, 1]\n\n    def calculate_revenue(sales, prices):\n        return [x*y for x, y in zip(sales, prices)]\n    \n    def apply_discount(prices, discount_events, discount_rate=0.1):\n        return [p * (1 - discount_rate) if e == 1 else p for p, e in zip(prices, discount_events)]\n\n    discounted_prices = apply_discount(prices, discount_events)\n    revenue = calculate_revenue(sales, discounted_prices)\n  \",\n\nCan observing an increase in revenue lead us to conclude that the discount rate was decreased?",
  "Explanation": "An increase in revenue could result from several factors including higher sales volume or higher original prices, independent of the discount rate. Because revenue is influenced by multiple factors beside discounts, an increase does not conclusively indicate a decrease in the discount rate without considering other variables.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
