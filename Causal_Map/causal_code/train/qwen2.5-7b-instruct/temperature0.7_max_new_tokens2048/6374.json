  "Problem": "def update_prices(prices, rate_increase, special_deal, day_of_week):\n    if day_of_week == 'Monday':\n        new_prices = {item: price * 1.05 for item, price in prices.items()}\n    else:\n        new_prices = {item: price * (1 + rate_increase) for item, price in prices.items()}\n    if special_deal:\n        new_prices = {item: price * 0.9 for item, price in new_prices.items()}\n    return new_prices\",\n\nAfter an intervention where 'new_prices' are consistently lower, can we determine if 'day_of_week' is a Monday?",
  "Explanation": "Even if an intervention caused 'new_prices' to be lower, this could be due to multiple factors such as 'special_deal' or a modification of 'rate_increase'. A lower pricing can't definitively indicate it is Monday, as these reductions could apply to any day with interventions.",
