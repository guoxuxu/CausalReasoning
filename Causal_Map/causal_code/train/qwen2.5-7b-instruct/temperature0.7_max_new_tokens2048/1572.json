  "Problem": "class WeatherTracker { var weatherType: String = 'sunny' func updateWeather(t: String) { weatherType = t } func shouldTakeUmbrella() -> Bool { return weatherType == 'rainy' } }\",\n\nIf shouldTakeUmbrella returns true, can we infer that the last updateWeather call was with 'rainy'?",
  "Explanation": "The shouldTakeUmbrella method returns true only if weatherType is 'rainy'. Since the only method altering weatherType is updateWeather, it implies that this method was last called with 'rainy' as its parameter.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
