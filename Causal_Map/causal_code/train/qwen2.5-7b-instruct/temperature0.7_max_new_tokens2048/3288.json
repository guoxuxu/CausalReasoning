  "Explanation": "Intervening by decreasing the 'orange' sold directly influences the result by increasing the remaining 'orange' stock, as the update_inventory function directly adjusts stock based on sales.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
