It includes a variable for the oven's functionality, which can be disrupted, affecting the baking process.\",\n    \"Code\": \"\"\"\ndef bake_cake(ingredients, oven_working):\n    if 'flour' in ingredients and 'eggs' in ingredients and oven_working:\n        cake = 'baked'\n    else:\n        cake = 'not baked'\n    return cake\n\noven_status = True\ningredients = ['flour', 'eggs', 'sugar']\ncake_status = bake_cake(ingredients, oven_status)\n\nprint('Cake status:', cake_status)\n\"\"\"\n  },\n\nDoes the presence of a baked cake always indicate that the oven was working?",
  "Explanation": "The cake can only be baked ('baked' status) if the oven is working. Hence, if the cake is baked, it directly indicates the functionality of the oven.",
