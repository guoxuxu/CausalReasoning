  "Explanation": "Updating the factory status to non-operational using the updateFactoryStatus function changes the air quality index to a lower value (40), which is a programmed response within the function. Therefore, this intervention directly leads to a decreased air quality index.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
