  "Explanation": "If both heater and cooler are off within the context of this system, it implies that the system reached the preset target temperature and therefore deactivated both devices to maintain balance.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
