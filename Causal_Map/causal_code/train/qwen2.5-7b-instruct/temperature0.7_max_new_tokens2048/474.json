  "Explanation": "If `acOn` is set to true, the code in `adjustTemperature` indicates this happens because the `desiredTemp` is less than the `temperature`. This inference of cause (desired temperature set lower) from effect (AC turned on) is correct assuming no external changes to the system's state or settings.",
