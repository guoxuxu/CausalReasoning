  "Problem": "def process_sales_data(data, discount_rate, holiday):\n                        sales_total = sum(data)\n                        if holiday:\n                            sales_total *= 1.1\n                        discounted_total = sales_total * (1 - discount_rate)\n                        return discounted_total\",\n\nIf an external factor ensures that the 'discount_rate' is zero, will setting 'holiday' to True still affect the 'discounted_total'?",
  "Explanation": "With 'discount_rate' set to zero through external intervention, 'discounted_total' equals 'sales_total'. If 'holiday' is set to True, 'sales_total' is increased by 1.1, directly increasing 'discounted_total'. Thus, the holiday effect on 'discounted_total' remains, illustrating the causal impact with intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
