  "Explanation": "Increasing the inventory directly affects the capacity to sell more items. Therefore, adjusting the inventory to a higher quantity allows more successful transactions via sell_item, assuming demand and supplied quantities.",

Additionally, restocking apples increases their availability in the inventory, affecting future sell_item calls."
