  "Explanation": "An 'intermediate' value being less than 150 simply indicates that the result after processing through 'process_data' is below 150. This can occur both when 'action_flag' is True or False, depending on the value of 'data_point'. Without knowing the exact value of 'data_point' or the operation applied inside 'process_data', we cannot determine the state of 'action_flag' reliably.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Setting 'flag' to True results in 'result' being double 'data_point', while setting 'flag' to False adds 100 to 'data_point'. The value of 'intermediate' is determined by the 'result' from 'process_data', which in turn depends on 'flag' and 'data_point'. If 'intermediate' is less than 150, it implies that 'result' was obtained by adding 100 to 'data_point', indicating 'flag' was likely set to False."
