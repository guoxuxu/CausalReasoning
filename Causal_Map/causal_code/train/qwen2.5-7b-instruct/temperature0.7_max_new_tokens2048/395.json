  "Explanation": "Increasing the user_input by 5 before it is processed leads to an increase in final_data. In the process_data function, modified_data becomes (user_input + 5) * 2, and final_data will be ((user_input + 5) * 2) + 10, therefore increasing overall.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
