  "Problem": "def sales_prediction(store_rating, ad_budget, season):\n    base_sales = 500\n    if store_rating > 8:\n        base_sales += 200\n    else:\n        base_sales += 100\n\n    if ad_budget > 30000:\n        base_sales *= 1.2\n    else:\n        base_sales *= 1.1\n\n    if season == 'high':\n        base_sales *= 1.5\n    elif season == 'medium':\n        base_sales *= 1.3\n    else:\n        base_sales *= 1.1\n    return base_sales\",\n\nDoes increasing the advertisement budget to above 30,000 increase the sales without any interventions?",
  "Explanation": "According to the code, if `ad_budget` is greater than 30,000, then `base_sales` is multiplied by 1.2; otherwise, it is multiplied by 1.1. Increasing the ad budget above 30,000 directly contributes to an increase in sales without needing other variables to be altered.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
