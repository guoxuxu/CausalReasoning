  "Explanation": "The 'category' being 'Low' does not definitively indicate that the 'price' was less than or equal to 100 because the price key might not have existed in the data dictionary, in which case the 'category' would also be set to 'Low'. Thus, we don't have a reliable backward inference from 'category' to 'price'.",
