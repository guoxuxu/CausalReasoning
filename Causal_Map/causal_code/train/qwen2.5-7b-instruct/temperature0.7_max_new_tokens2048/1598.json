  "Explanation": "Manipulating external conditions to achieve a 'Cold' status could involve reducing the temperature or significantly adjusting the humidity to increase the effect of temperature adjustment. Thus, the actual temperature does not necessarily have to be low initially.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If humidity is greater than 70, it increases the perceived temperature; if humidity is less than 30, it decreases the perceived temperature. The perceived temperature then determines the weather status. Setting the weather status to 'Cold' can be due to a low actual temperature, high adjustment (due to humidity), or a combination of both."
