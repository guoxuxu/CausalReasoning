  "Problem": "public class WeatherApp {\n    private boolean isRainy;\n    private int temperature;\n\n    public WeatherApp(boolean isRainy, int temperature) {\n        this.isRainy = isRainy;\n        this.temperature = temperature;\n    }\n\n    public String getWeatherStatus() {\n        if (isRainy) {\n            return temperature < 15 ? \"Cold and rainy\" : \"Mild and rainy\";\n        } else {\n            return temperature >= 25 ? \"Hot and sunny\" : \"Pleasant\";\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void updateWeather(boolean rain, int temp) {\n        isRainy = rain;\n        temperature = temp;\n    }\n}\",\n\nDoes the method getWeatherStatus return 'Hot and sunny' because the updateWeather method was called?",
  "Explanation": "The return value of 'Hot and sunny' from getWeatherStatus is directly due to the conditions isRainy being false and temperature being 25 or higher. The method updateWeather may have changed these variables, but it is not necessarily the cause of the specific condition unless known it set these values. This tests the ability to infer back from the effect to the cause without direct intervention details.",
