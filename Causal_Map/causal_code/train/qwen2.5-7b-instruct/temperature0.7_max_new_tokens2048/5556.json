  "Problem": "def manipulate_data(data, action):\n    if action == 'increase':\n        result = data * 1.2\n    elif action == 'decrease':\n        result = data / 1.5\n    else:\n        result = data - 10\n    return result\n\ndata_value = 50\noutput = manipulate_data(data_value, 'increase')\",\n\nIf the output is less than the input, can we deduce that the action was 'decrease'?",
  "Explanation": "While the 'decrease' action does reduce the input (by dividing it by 1.5), setting action to 'else' (implying any string other than 'increase' or 'decrease') subtracts 10 from the data, which could also lead to an output less than the input, depending on the original data value.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The action influences the result, which in turn determines the output. A higher action value generally leads to a higher result unless it triggers subtraction, and data_value directly contributes to the calculation of result."
