  "Problem": "class WeatherManager {\n    int forecastTemp;\n\n    public WeatherManager(int currentTemp) {\n        if (currentTemp < 15) {\n            forecastTemp = 10;\n        } else {\n            forecastTemp = 25;\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void applyHeatWave() {\n        forecastTemp += 5;\n    }\n\n    public boolean isCold() {\n        return forecastTemp < 20;\n    }\n}\",\n\nIs the current temperature less than 15 degrees if the isCold method returned true?",
  "Explanation": "While it is true the `isCold` method returns true if `forecastTemp` is less than 20, and this will happen if the original temperature was less than 15 (setting `forecastTemp` to 10), it could also return true if the temperature was originally 15 or more (setting `forecastTemp` initially to 25), but then a heat wave reduced (`forecastTemp += 5`) and subsequently returned to just below 20 degrees. Thus, one cannot conclusively determine that the initial temperature was less than 15 if `isCold` returns true.",
