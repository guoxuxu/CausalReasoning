  "Explanation": "An increase in sales value can be attributed to either an increase in quantity sold or an increase in item prices, without additional information on quantity or price changes, one cannot definitively conclude that prices were increased.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
