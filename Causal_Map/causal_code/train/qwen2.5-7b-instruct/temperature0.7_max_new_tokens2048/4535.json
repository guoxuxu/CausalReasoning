  "Problem": "def calculate_sales(tax_rate, base_price, discount_rate, season):\n    if season == 'holiday':\n        discount_rate += 0.05\n    final_price = base_price * (1 - discount_rate)\n    tax_amount = final_price * tax_rate\n    total_price = final_price + tax_amount\n    return total_price\",\n\nIf the base price increases, will the total price necessarily increase?",
  "Explanation": "When the base price increases, the final price also increases as it's directly proportional (final_price = base_price * (1 - discount_rate)). The increase in final price causes an increase in both the tax_amount (since tax_amount = final_price * tax_rate) and subsequently the total_price (since total_price = final_price + tax_amount). Thus, without any intervention, an increase in base price leads to an increase in total price.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
