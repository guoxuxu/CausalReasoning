  "Problem": "\n    sales = 100\n    season = 'winter'\n    discount = 0.2\n    if season == 'winter':\n        sales += 50\n    else:\n        sales -= 10\n    final_price = 200 * (1 - discount)\n    if sales > 120:\n        final_price *= 0.9\n    \"\"\",\n\nIf we set the season to spring and apply no discounts, will sales exceed 120?",
  "Explanation": "If the season is set to spring and discounts are ignored (kept at 0.2 or removed entirely), the sales will decrease by 10, resulting in sales equal to 90, which does not exceed 120.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
