  "Explanation": "Reducing the number of students via the method used in 'hire_additional_teacher' is not feasible. The method only provides a mechanism to increase teachers and, consequently, students. A direct reversal to reduce students is not implemented in the provided code structure.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
