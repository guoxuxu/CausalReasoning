  "Explanation": "Although decreasing the price below 50 triggers a sales increase per the `forecastSales` method, an increase in sales cannot conclusively indicate that such an intervention was made, as other factors could drive sales up. Additionally, the code allows for independence between price setting and observing sales trends, thus intervention is not the only plausible explanation.",
