  "Explanation": "Since the modification happens after the execution of 'process_data', the earlier set 'status' ('failed' or 'success') remains unchanged by this downstream external intervention. Therefore, a 'success' status could indeed exist, provided there was no initial 'error' or ValueError during the execution of 'process_data'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The presence of 'error' in data directly leads to 'status' being set to 'failed'. The absence of 'error' and successful conversion of 'value' to an integer results in 'status' being set to 'success' and 'result' being calculated as twice the value of 'value'. Any failure in converting 'value' to an integer also leads to 'status' being set to 'failed'."
