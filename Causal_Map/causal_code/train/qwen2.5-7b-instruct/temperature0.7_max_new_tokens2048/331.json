  "Explanation": "By externally setting 'has_coupon' to false, the method 'apply_coupon' will stop applying an additional 10% discount regardless of other factors. This effectively increases the 'final_price' that a 'premium' customer pays as the additional discount layer is removed in the computation.",

The customer_type 'premium' leads to an initial 10% discount before applying any coupon, so changing 'has_coupon' does not further reduce the price for this type."
