  "Explanation": "By intervening and explicitly setting the activity to 'watch movies', the function `prepare_items()` subsequently selects 'popcorn' and 'soft drinks' as the necessary items. This demonstrates direct causation from the stipulated cause (activity choice) to the effect (items prepared) with an intervention altering the activity.",
