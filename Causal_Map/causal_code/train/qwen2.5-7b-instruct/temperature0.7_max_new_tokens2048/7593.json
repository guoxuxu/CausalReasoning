  "Explanation": "In the given code, if the marketing campaign is not active, the revenue would not increase by 20%. Hence, the profit calculated as `revenue - costs` would decrease compared to the scenario where the campaign is active. The profit is directly affected by the terms in the calculation which here is influenced by the revenue increase due to the marketing campaign.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "revenue → profit; costs → profit; marketing_campaign_active → revenue; marketing_campaign_active → profit",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Marketing campaign activity directly increases revenue, which in turn increases profit. Revenue and costs determine profit. If the marketing campaign is not active, revenue will not increase, and thus profit will not increase."
