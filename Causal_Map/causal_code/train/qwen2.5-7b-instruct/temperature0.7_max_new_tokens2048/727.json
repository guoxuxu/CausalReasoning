If 'invest_more' is found to be False, can it be concluded the business wasn't profitable to begin with?",
  "Explanation": "Given the hypothetical intervention that sets 'invest_more' to False for profitable businesses, the status of 'invest_more' being False cannot conclusively determine the unprofitability of the business. Under the new policy, profitable businesses will also have 'invest_more' set to False, confusing the original causal connection.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Sales and expenses determine profit, which then determines whether the business is marked as profitable. Profitability influences the decision on whether to invest more, but if invest_more is set to False due to policy changes, it does not necessarily mean the business wasn't profitable; it just means the policy overrides the profitability status."
