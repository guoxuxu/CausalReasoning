  "Explanation": "The method 'hire_additional_teacher' directly increases the number of teachers by one and then recalculates the number of students by invoking 'calculate_students'. This intervention in the form of hiring will indeed change the number of students.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
