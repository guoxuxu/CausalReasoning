  "Explanation": "Increasing the base_price raises the final_price of each item sold (final_price = base_price * (1 + tax_rate)), leading to higher total cost per sale. Since total_revenue depends on the sum of all sales, it consequently increases.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
