  "Problem": "def calculate_prices(base_price, discount, tax_rate):\n    discounted_price = base_price - (base_price * discount)\n    final_price = discounted_price + (discounted_price * tax_rate)\n    return final_price\",\n\nIf the final_price decreases, can we infer the tax_rate was reduced, assuming an intervention allows us to keep base_price and discount constant?",
  "Explanation": "Although decreasing the tax_rate might reduce the final_price, the observed decrease in final_price could also potentially result from a higher discount. Without specific information about changes in the discount rate, we cannot conclusively infer that a decrease in tax_rate was the cause.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
