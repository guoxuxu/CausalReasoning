  "Explanation": "According to the code, the function `adjust_humidity` multiplies the input humidity level by 1.08 to compute actual humidity. If resultant humidity exceeds 80, the fan is turned on automatically. Thus, increasing the humidity level increases the probability of exceeding this threshold, thereby automatically turning on the fan.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in humidity level leads to a higher likelihood of the fan turning on, as the fan status is determined by the humidity level which is calculated from the input level."
