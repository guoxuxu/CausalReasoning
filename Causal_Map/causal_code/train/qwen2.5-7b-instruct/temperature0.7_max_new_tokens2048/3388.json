  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, discount, season):\n    if season == 'summer':\n        if discount:\n            return price * 0.9\n        else:\n            return price\n    elif season == 'winter':\n        if discount:\n            return price * 0.8\n        else:\n            return price * 1.1\n    else:\n        return price\",\n\nIf we introduce a mandatory 10% discount regardless of the season, will the sales depend on the season?",
  "Explanation": "Even with a mandatory discount, the final sales price still varies by season as the amount by which the price is reduced from the original differs between 'summer' and 'winter'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Before the discount change, sales depend on both the price and the season. Specifically, a summer season without a discount leads to the same sales as the price, while with a discount, it reduces to 90% of the price. In winter without a discount, sales increase to 110% of the price, and with a discount, they reduce to 80% of the price. Introducing a mandatory 10% discount eliminates the effect of the season on sales."
