  "Explanation": "In the given code, the maximum score without certification is 20, calculated when 'experience' is over 5 years. A score higher than 30 can only be achieved if the additional 30 points for being certified are awarded, thus indicating the employee must be certified.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "An employee's experience directly influences their score, and being certified increases their score. If an employee has more than 5 years of experience, their base score is 20, which becomes 50 if they are also certified, exceeding 30."
