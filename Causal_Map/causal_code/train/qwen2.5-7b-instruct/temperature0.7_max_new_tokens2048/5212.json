  "Explanation": "Although the 'high' effectiveness level indicates a likely scenario where the number of doctors is 10 or more, the causal relation isn't strictly bidirectional as other unaccounted conditions (like a specific policy or external help) may enable high effectiveness despite fewer doctors.",
