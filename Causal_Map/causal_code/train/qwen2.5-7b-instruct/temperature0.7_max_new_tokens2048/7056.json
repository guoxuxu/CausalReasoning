  "Explanation": "Manually setting 'status' to 'failed' does not provide direct evidence that 'errors' was present or added, as 'status' could be set to 'failed' manually in the absence of 'errors'. Intervention on the effect ('status') does not necessarily imply the original cause ('errors' was present).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "If 'errors' is present, then 'status' is set to 'failed'. If 'errors' is not present, 'status' is set to 'success' if there are items, otherwise 'empty'. The presence of 'errors' directly influences 'status', while 'success_count' indirectly affects 'status' through its value."
