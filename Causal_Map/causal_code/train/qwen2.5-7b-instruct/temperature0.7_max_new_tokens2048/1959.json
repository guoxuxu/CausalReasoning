  "Explanation": "Setting likes to zero will directly influence the calculation of popularity, making it zero regardless of the number of views. Since the minimum conditional value to determine 'High' or 'Low' is the existence of 'views' and 'likes' keys, and zero multiplied by any number is zero, the result must be 'Low' as long as the keys exist.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
