  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n    if 'age' in data and data['age'] > 18: \n        adult = True \n    else: \n        adult = False \n    if adult: \n        discount = 0.1 \n    else: \n        discount = 0.2 \n    final_price = data['price'] - data['price'] * discount \n    return final_price\",\n\nIf the final_price is less than the initial price, can we conclude the customer is an adult?",
  "Explanation": "The final price being less than the initial price can be due to a discount, which applies for both adults (10% discount) and non-adults (20% discount). The magnitude of the discount alone does not indicate whether the customer is an adult or not.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "If the customer's age is greater than 18, they are considered an adult, which results in a 10% discount on the price. The final price is calculated after applying the discount. If the final price is less than the initial price, it indicates the customer has received a discount, implying they are an adult."
