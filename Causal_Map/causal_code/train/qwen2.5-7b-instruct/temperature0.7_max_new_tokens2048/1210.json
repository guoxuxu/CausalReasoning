  "Explanation": "Reducing the hunt_success_rate decreases the number of rabbits eaten, which means more rabbits survive; however, the foxes still gain additional population from the rabbits they do eat, just at a slower rate.",

  "causal_map_integration": "Increasing the hunt_success_rate leads to fewer eaten_rabbits, which in turn leads to fewer rabbits. Fewer eaten_rabbits also mean fewer new foxes, but since the decrease in eaten_rabbits is more significant, the fox population will decrease."
