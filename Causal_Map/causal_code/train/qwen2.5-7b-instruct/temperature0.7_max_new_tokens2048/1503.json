Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If the increment in 'increase_speed' is greater than 100, the car's speed will be capped at 100. The car's sound depends on whether it is electric ('Whirring' for electric, 'Vroom' for non-electric), and calling 'increase_speed' increases the car's speed by the specified increment."
