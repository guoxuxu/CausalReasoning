  "Explanation": "For rain to occur, clouds must first form, which happens if the humidity is above 80% and the temperature is below 20 degrees Celsius. Furthermore, rain only falls when clouds are present and the temperature is below 15 degrees Celsius.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
