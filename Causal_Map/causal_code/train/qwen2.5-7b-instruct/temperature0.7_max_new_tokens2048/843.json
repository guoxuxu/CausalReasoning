  "Explanation": "Setting the result to a higher value could be achieved either by increasing x or y, or both. Without knowing specific changes to other variables (like y), it cannot be definitively concluded that the increase in the result was due solely to an increase in x.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "By increasing x, z and u will increase, and through u and v, the result will also increase. Similarly, increasing y will increase z and u, and thus the result. The condition x > 0 specifically determines the value of v."
