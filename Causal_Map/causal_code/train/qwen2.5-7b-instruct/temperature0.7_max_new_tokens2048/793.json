  "Explanation": "While receiving multiple 'A' events can set the flag to true, the current state of the flag doesn't necessarily indicate which type of event was last received, as subsequent 'B' events, resetting the counter to 0 and flag to false, could have occurred without changing the current observation of the flag if it wasn’t checked in between.",
