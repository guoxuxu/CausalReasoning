  "Explanation": "Setting 'is_adult' to True only ensures that 'credit_score' could be calculated if 'purchase_history' exists. However, 'loan_approval' also requires that the computed 'credit_score' exceeds 50 for it to be calculated. Hence, it does not guarantee that 'loan_approval' will be calculated.",
