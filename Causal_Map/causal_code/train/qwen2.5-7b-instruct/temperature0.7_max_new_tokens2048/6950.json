  "Explanation": "The 'tax_bracket' being defined depends not only on the 'age' being greater than 18 (which sets 'adult' to True), but also on 'income' being present and its value. Without 'income' data, or if income does not exceed 30000, even if the person is an adult, the 'tax_bracket' cannot be determined as 'high' or 'low'.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "If 'age' is greater than 18, then 'adult' is set to True, which can lead to the definition of 'tax_bracket' based on 'income'."
