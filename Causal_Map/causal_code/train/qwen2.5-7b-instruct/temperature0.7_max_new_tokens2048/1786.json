  "Explanation": "The 'increaseTemperature' method increases the temperature and directly checks if the temperature exceeds 20 degrees. If it does, 'isSunny' is set to true. Thereby, raising the temperature above 20 necessarily makes it sunny.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
