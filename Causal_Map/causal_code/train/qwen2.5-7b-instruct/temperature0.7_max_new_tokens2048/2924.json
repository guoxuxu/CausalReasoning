  "Problem": "def update_scores(scores, action, delta):\n    if action == 'add':\n        for i in range(len(scores)):\n            scores[i] += delta\n    elif action == 'multiply':\n        for i in range(len(scores)):\n            scores[i] *= delta\n    return scores\n\nscores_list = [10, 20, 30]\nupdate_scores(scores_list, 'add', 5)\nupdate_scores(scores_list, 'multiply', 2)\",\n\nIf we intervene and fix the action to 'add', does an increase in the value of delta lead to a greater increase in the scores of `scores_list`?",
  "Explanation": "When the action is fixed to 'add' and delta is increased, it leads directly to an increase in each element of `scores_list` by a greater magnitude. Since the scores are incrementally increased by the value of delta, a higher delta results in a more substantial increase in scores.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in the value of delta, when the action is set to 'add', leads to a greater increase in the scores of scores_list. The action 'add' directly causes the scores to be incremented by delta, and an increase in delta will result in a larger increment."
