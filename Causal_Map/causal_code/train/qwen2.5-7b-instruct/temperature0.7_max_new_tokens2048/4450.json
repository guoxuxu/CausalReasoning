  "Explanation": "Given that willPeopleUseUmbrellas solely evaluates the weather being 'rainy' for its positive result through the isRainy method, a return value of false implies an intervention that changed the weather to a state other than 'rainy'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
