  "Explanation": "Remaining the same risk level despite aging and the existing smoking habit implies an intervention, because normally, either condition (age over 50 or smoking) would independently increase the risk level. Since the medication can reduce the risk by lowering smoking impact, it's a reasonable inference.",
