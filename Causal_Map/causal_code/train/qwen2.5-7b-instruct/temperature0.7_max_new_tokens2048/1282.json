  "Explanation": "If the discount has been directly set to '20%' via intervention without considering 'is_adult', the relationship between age and discount is disrupted, making it inaccurate to infer 'is_adult' or age group based purely on the discount.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
