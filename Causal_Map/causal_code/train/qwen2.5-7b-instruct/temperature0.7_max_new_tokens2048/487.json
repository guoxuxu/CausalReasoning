  "Explanation": "Adding a constant value to the result, regardless of the operation type, means that each operation no longer inherently determines the final result on its own as the additive intervention constantly shifts the baseline of the result.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
