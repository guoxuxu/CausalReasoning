  "Explanation": "The method 'isWeatherBad()' checks if the temperature is below 50 or if it is raining. Setting the temperature below 50 directly influences the return value to be true, irrespective of the rain condition.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
