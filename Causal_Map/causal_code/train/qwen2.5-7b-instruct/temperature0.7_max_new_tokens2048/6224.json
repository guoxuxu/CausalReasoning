  "Problem": "def compute_salary(base_salary, days_worked, bonus, tax_rate):\n    salary_without_tax = base_salary * days_worked / 30\n    if bonus:\n        salary_without_tax += 500\n    tax = salary_without_tax * tax_rate\n    net_salary = salary_without_tax - tax\n    return net_salary\",\n\nWould a decrease in net_salary imply a decrease in base_salary?",
  "Explanation": "A decrease in `net_salary` can occur due to different factors besides a decrease in `base_salary`.  For instance, changes in other variables such as an increased `tax_rate`, a reduction in `days_worked`, or the absence/removal of a `bonus` could also lead to a decrease in `net_salary`. Therefore, solely based on a reduction in `net_salary`, we cannot conclusively deduce that `base_salary` was decreased.",
