  "Explanation": "In the context of the given code, the marketing priority is determined directly by the number of conversions. A low priority indicates that the corresponding conversions were below the threshold, as no other information or intervention alters this direct relationship in the provided code.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
