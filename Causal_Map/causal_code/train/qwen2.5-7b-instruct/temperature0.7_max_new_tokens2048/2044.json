  "Explanation": "Decreasing the 'principal' would not necessarily be an effective intervention here. Although reducing 'principal' would lower the 'final_amount', which is the observed outcome, the question on utility of the intervention depends heavily on the specific goal (e.g., reducing costs, maximizing outputs). If the goal is to optimize investment return or savings, decreasing 'principal' might not support objectives of yield maximization.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "principal → interest; principal → total_amount; deposit_rate → interest; years → interest; interest → total_amount",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Increasing the principal or deposit rate, or extending the years will increase the interest, which in turn increases the total amount. Decreasing the principal will reduce the total amount and thus might be a viable intervention to reduce the final amount."
