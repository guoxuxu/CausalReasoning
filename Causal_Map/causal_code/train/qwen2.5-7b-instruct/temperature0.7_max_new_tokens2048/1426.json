  "Problem": "class AirConditioner { constructor(powerState, temperature) { this.isOn = powerState; this.temperature = temperature; }  setTemperature(newTemp) { if (this.isOn && newTemp >= 16 && newTemp <= 30) { this.temperature = newTemp; } } togglePower() { this.isOn = !this.isOn; if (!this.isOn) { this.temperature = null; } } }\",\n\nAfter the temperature is seen as 25, if we then check and find the air conditioner is on, does this indicate that the togglePower was intervened?",
  "Explanation": "Finding the air conditioner on and temperature set to 25 is consistent with the air conditioner's default state assuming no additional context suggests toggling. There's no direct implication that the togglePower() has been invoked based on this observation alone, especially if the initial state is unknown.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
