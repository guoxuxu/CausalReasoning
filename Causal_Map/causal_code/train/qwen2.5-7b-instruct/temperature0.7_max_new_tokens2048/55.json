  "Explanation": "With an intervention setting every day sunny, the condition for sunniness in 'willPeopleGoOutside' is always met. However, people will only go outside if the temperature is also above 25 degrees, according to the conditions specified in the method.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
