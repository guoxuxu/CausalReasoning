  "Explanation": "The initial action of 'turn_on_AC' indicates that the status was 'hot', and based on the code, this status is linked to temperatures above 30 degrees Celsius. Changing the status to 'moderate' post-hoc does not alter the fact that the original temperature triggered the 'hot' status. Thus, the intervention does not provide information about the original temperature being below 30 degrees.",

  "causal_map_integration": "If the status is set to 'moderate', the action will be 'do_nothing'. The original temperature being below 30 degrees Celsius does not directly cause the status to be set to 'moderate'; instead, it leads to 'hot' which triggers 'turn_on_AC'. Changing the status to 'moderate' after seeing 'turn_on_AC' indicates the temperature was above 10 degrees but not above 30 degrees."
