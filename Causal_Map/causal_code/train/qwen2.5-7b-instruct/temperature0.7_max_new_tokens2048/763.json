  "Explanation": "Setting discountApplied to true externally does not necessarily reflect changes or prior states of totalSales via the updateSales method. This external change in the status of discountApplied does not indicate a directly associated large increase in totalSales through updateSales.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If totalSales exceeds discountThreshold, then discountApplied is set to true. An updateSales call with a positive amount can increase totalSales, potentially causing it to exceed discountThreshold and thus setting discountApplied to true."
