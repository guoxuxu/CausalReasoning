  "Problem": "def analyze_sales(data):\n  discounts = data['discount'] > 20\n  weekend = data['day'].isin(['Saturday', 'Sunday'])\n  high_sales = data['sales'] > 500\n  if discounts and weekend:\n    increase = 0.15 * data['sales']\n  else:\n    increase = 0.05 * data['sales']\n  data['forecast_sales'] = data['sales'] + increase\n  return data\",\n\nIs the presence of discounts a direct determinant of the value of the variable 'increase'?",
  "Explanation": "The 'increase' variable directly depends on whether the 'discounts' condition is met, along with the 'weekend' condition. Greater discounts (above 20%) coupled with weekend days significantly affect the 'increase' percentage.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
