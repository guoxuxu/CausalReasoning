  "Explanation": "Being 'Not eligible' can result both when a new policy is not applied (age <= 65 and no chronic disease, or age > 65 but with neither chronic disease nor new policy inclusion) and when a new policy is applied but other conditions do not fulfill (e.g., a young person with no chronic issues even under new policy).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Age greater than 65 directly leads to eligibility due to age only. Having a chronic disease directly leads to eligibility due to health condition only. The presence of a new policy directly leads to eligibility under new policy. The status 'Not eligible' implies none of the above conditions for eligibility are met."
