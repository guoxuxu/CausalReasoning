  "Explanation": "While `updateWeather` can cause `isRaining` to be true when humidity is high, this doesn't provide direct information about the temperature, which is independent in this aspect. Additionally, rain can occur with different temperatures due to other factors like humidity.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
