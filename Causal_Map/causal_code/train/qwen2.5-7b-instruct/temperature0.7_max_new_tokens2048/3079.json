  "Explanation": "While articles matching user preferences are more likely to score higher and thus be recommended, the counter-mechanism reducing the score for articles that were previously interacted with can allow less preferred, but not interacted articles to be recommended.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
