  "Explanation": "Increasing the budget will allow the purchase of more ads. More ads lead to more clicks given the fixed base click rate and potentially higher conversions due to increased exposure. This reasoning assumes all other factors like season and click rate remain constant.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in budget leads to an increase in the number of ads bought, which in turn increases the number of clicks received. The click rate affects the effective click rate, which influences the number of clicks. The number of clicks influences the conversion rate, which ultimately determines the number of conversions."
