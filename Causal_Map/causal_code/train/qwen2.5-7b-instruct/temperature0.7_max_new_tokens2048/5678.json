  "Problem": "def compute_discount(price, is_member):\n    if is_member:\n        discount = 0.1\n    else:\n        discount = 0.02\n    final_price = price * (1 - discount)\n    return final_price\",\n\nAfter changing the discount for all shoppers to a flat 5%, if we see that the final price for an item remains higher for some customers, is this caused by their membership status?",
  "Explanation": "Since the discount is uniformly set to 5% for all customers, variations in final price must be attributed to factors other than membership status, such as variations in the base price of the items being purchased.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Membership status directly influences the discount applied, which in turn affects the final price."
