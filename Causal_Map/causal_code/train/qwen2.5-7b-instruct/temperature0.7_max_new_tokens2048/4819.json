  "Explanation": "The given code checks if it is raining first; if it is not and the temperature is less than or equal to 20, the suggestion defaults to 'Wear a jacket'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
