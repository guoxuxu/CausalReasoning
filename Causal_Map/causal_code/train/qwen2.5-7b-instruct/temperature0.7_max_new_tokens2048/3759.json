  "Explanation": "Since 'revenue' is directly computed as the product of 'price' and 'quantity', and it can only be greater than 1000 if neither of these is zero, it implies both were provided and were sufficiently large to yield a 'revenue' over 1000.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
