  "Explanation": "A cold wave reduces the current temperature by 10 degrees. If this lowered temperature falls below the thermostat's desired temperature, the 'regulate_temp' function will trigger the 'heat_room' method to increase the temperature by 5 degrees until reaching the desired temperature.",
