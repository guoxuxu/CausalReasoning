  "Explanation": "Decreases in 'maximum_sales' could occur due to data manipulation that does not necessarily involve removing the highest sales figures (e.g., adjusting values rather than removing them). Without specific knowledge of the changes applied to 'sales_data', no definitive conclusion can be drawn about the cause of a change in 'maximum_sales'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_map_integration": "Updating the sales data with new figures (update_sales_data) directly causes changes in the total sales, average sales, minimum sales, and maximum sales values. These changes propagate through the dependencies among the variables."
