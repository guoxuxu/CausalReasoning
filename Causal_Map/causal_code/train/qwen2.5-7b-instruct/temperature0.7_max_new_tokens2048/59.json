  "Explanation": "Keeping the temperature above 25 degrees due to an intervention (increaseHeat method) consistently triggers the humidity increase condition. This causal link from the method ensures that as long as the temperature remains above 25, the humidity increases.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
