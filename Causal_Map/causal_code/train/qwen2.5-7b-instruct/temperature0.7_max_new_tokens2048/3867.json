  "Problem": "def process_data(input_data):\n    noisy_data = input_data + 10\n    filtered_data = noisy_data - 5\n    processed_data = filtered_data * 2\n    return processed_data\",\n\nIf the variable processed_data is increased, does this imply the variable input_data was increased?",
  "Explanation": "Processed_data depends linearly on filtered_data, which in turn depends on noisy_data and ultimately on input_data. Given no information about external interventions altering this dependency (like modifying coefficients inside operations), an increase in processed_data mostly suggests an increase in input_data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Increasing input_data leads to an increase in noisy_data, which then leads to an increase in filtered_data, and finally results in an increase in processed_data."
