  "Problem": "def adjust_temperature(current_temperature, desired_temperature):\n    if current_temperature < desired_temperature:\n        return 'increase', desired_temperature - current_temperature\n    elif current_temperature > desired_temperature:\n        return 'decrease', current_temperature - desired_temperature\n    else:\n        return 'maintain', 0\n\ndef control_system(temperature_reading, set_point):\n    action, adjustment = adjust_temperature(temperature_reading, set_point)\n    if action == 'increase':\n        heating_system(adjustment)\n    elif action == 'decrease':\n        cooling_system(adjustment)\n    else:\n        maintain_temperature()\n\ndef heating_system(degrees):\n    print(f'Heating by {degrees} degrees.')\n\ndef cooling_system(degrees):\n    print(f'Cooling by {degrees} degrees.')\n\ndef maintain_temperature():\n    print('Temperature is optimal.')\",\n\nIf the control system reads the same temperature as the set point, would the action be to maintain temperature?",
  "Explanation": "In the 'adjust_temperature' function, when 'current_temperature' equals 'desired_temperature', the function returns 'maintain', 0. This causes 'control_system' to execute 'maintain_temperature', which confirms the action to maintain temperature.",
