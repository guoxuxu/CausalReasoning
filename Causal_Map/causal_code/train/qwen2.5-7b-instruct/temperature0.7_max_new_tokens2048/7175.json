  "Problem": "def calculate_net_salary(gross_salary, tax_rate, bonus_percentage):\n    taxes = gross_salary * tax_rate\n    bonus = gross_salary * bonus_percentage\n    net_salary = gross_salary - taxes + bonus\n    return net_salary\",\n\nIf we fix the tax rate and bonus percentage and test for the net salary reaction to changes in gross salary, can we understand the cause-effect relationship between gross salary and net salary?",
  "Explanation": "By fixing the tax rate and bonus percentage, we remove external influences on net salary from those variables. Therefore, changes in the net salary due to variations in the gross salary can be directly attributed to the cause (gross salary changes) under this controlled intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Gross salary directly influences net salary through the calculation of taxes and bonus. Tax rate directly causes taxes, and bonus percentage directly causes bonus."
