  "Explanation": "Manually lowering the targetTemperature will cause the currentTemperature to decrease, provided the external temperature is higher than the new, lower targetTemperature. If the external temperature is lower than both the old and new targets, currentTemperature will remain unchanged—equal to the external temperature.",
