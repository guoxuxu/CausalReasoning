  "Explanation": "Changing 'data' to only contain positive integers does not necessarily reduce variance; variance depends on how spread out the elements are around the mean. However, constraining the contents might reduce variance if it leads to less variability around the mean.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
