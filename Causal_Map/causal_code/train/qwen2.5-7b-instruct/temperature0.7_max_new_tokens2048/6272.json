  "Explanation": "From effect to cause without intervention: While an increase in z suggests that y might have increased (as z = 3y + 5), y can increase due to the random noise addition independent of x (as y = 2x + noise). Therefore, an increase in z doesn't necessarily mean x has increased.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
