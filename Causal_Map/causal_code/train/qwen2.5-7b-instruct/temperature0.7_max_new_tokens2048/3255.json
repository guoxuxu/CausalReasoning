  "Explanation": "While an external temperature below 20 will decrease the body temperature and could potentially make 'cold' true, 'cold' being true could also be caused by a high body temperature returning to a normal range below 36 due to other interactions not related directly to external temperature (like medication effects or overcoming sickness), hence we cannot infer exclusively from 'cold' to a specific external temperature.",
