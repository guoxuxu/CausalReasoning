  "Explanation": "Given that customer feedback is directly calculated from sales (customer_feedback = sales / 10), a company intervention to lower customer feedback would directly necessitate a reduction in sales, as per the mathematical relationship defined in the code.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If customer feedback decreases, sales will likely decrease because lower customer feedback leads to a reduction in advertising expense, which in turn can reduce sales."
