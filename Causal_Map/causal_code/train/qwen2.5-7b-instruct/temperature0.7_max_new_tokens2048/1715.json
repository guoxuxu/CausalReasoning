  "Explanation": "The updateWeather method inverts the isRaining state if the day number is divisible by 7, thus switching from non-raining (sunny) to raining.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
