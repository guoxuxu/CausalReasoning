  "Explanation": "Manipulating the 'basePrice' directly does not necessarily affect the 'hasDiscount' status, nor does observing 'finalPrice' directly help in determining the state of 'hasDiscount', because 'finalPrice' is calculated with potential additional factors like 'additionalFee'. Without controlling for 'additionalFee', 'finalPrice' alone is insufficient to ascertain the 'hasDiscount' state.",
