  "Problem": "def adjust_humidity(level): \n    humidity = level * 1.08 \n    if humidity > 80: \n        fan_status = 'on' \n    else: \n        fan_status = 'off' \n    return fan_status \n\nhumid_level = 75 \nfan_output = adjust_humidity(humid_level)\",\n\nIf manual intervention sets the fan to 'off', does this indicate the humidity was below the threshold prior to intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Turning the fan off manually does not necessarily imply that the humidity was below the threshold prior to intervention; it simply overrides the automated outcome of the function. The actual humidity could still have been above the threshold, but the fan was manually turned off despite this.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
