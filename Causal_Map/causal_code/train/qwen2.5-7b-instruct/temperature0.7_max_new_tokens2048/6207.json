  "Problem": "def update_inventory(item_sales, inventory_counts):\n    for item, sold in item_sales.items():\n        if item in inventory_counts:\n            inventory_counts[item] -= sold\n    return inventory_counts\",\n\nIf the number of items sold increases, will the items remaining in the inventory decrease?",
  "Explanation": "The code reduces the inventory count for each item by the number of units sold. Therefore, if sales increase, the remaining inventory for that item decreases since the subtraction amount from the inventory is directly based on the sales count.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
