  "Explanation": "An increase in sales does not necessarily indicate the use of a 'premium_ad' strategy, as sales could increase due to a variety of factors including the employment of different marketing strategies like 'discount', or variations in customer group composition (more high_income customers, for example).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "A higher likelihood of purchase due to a premium advertising strategy increases the chance of a sale, while a discount strategy also increases the likelihood but to a lesser extent. The likelihood of purchase influences the number of sales on a given day."
