  "Problem": "class ShoppingCart {\n    int itemCount;\n    double totalPrice;\n\n    ShoppingCart() {\n        this.itemCount = 0;\n        this.totalPrice = 0.0;\n    }\n\n    void addItem(double price) {\n        this.itemCount++;\n        this.totalPrice += price;\n    }\n\n    void applyDiscount(double discountRate) {\n        this.totalPrice *= (1 - discountRate);\n    }\n\n    void removeItem(double price) {\n        if (this.itemCount > 0) {\n            this.itemCount--;\n            this.totalPrice -= price;\n        }\n    }\n}\",\n\nIf a user applies a discount, will this affect the value of `totalPrice` if `addItem` has been called multiple times?",
  "Explanation": "Applying a discount alters `totalPrice` by multiplying it by `(1 - discountRate)`. If `addItem` has been used to increase `totalPrice`, the impact of the discount is proportional to the current `totalPrice`, creating a causal effect from the intervention (discount application) on the effect on `totalPrice`.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
