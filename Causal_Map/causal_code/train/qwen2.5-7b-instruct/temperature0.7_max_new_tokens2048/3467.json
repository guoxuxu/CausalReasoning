  "Explanation": "While it is true that wearing a 'formal shirt' corresponds to the activity of visiting a museum, which is linked to the weather being 'rainy', it is possible for someone to wear a 'formal shirt' in a different context not captured by our function. Therefore, while the 'formal shirt' significantly suggests rainy weather in this scenario, it does not conclusively indicate it without understanding other possible influences.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "If the attire is a 'formal shirt', then the weather must have been rainy, because rainy weather leads to planning a museum visit which in turn results in wearing a formal shirt."
