  "Problem": "def calculateInterest(balance, rate): \n    if balance > 1000: \n        interest = balance * (rate / 100) \n    else: \n        interest = balance * (rate / 2 / 100) \n    return interest\",\n\nIf the balance increases, will the interest calculated also increase, assuming no other changes?",
  "Explanation": "In the given function, the interest is directly calculated based on the balance and rate. If the balance increases, the computed interest either grows proportionally (when balance > 1000) or at a lesser rate (when balance <= 1000) without other changes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in balance will lead to an increase in interest if the balance exceeds 1000, otherwise, the interest increases at half the balance rate. The rate directly influences the amount of interest calculated."
