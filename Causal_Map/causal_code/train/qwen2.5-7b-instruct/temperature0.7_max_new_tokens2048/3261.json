  "Explanation": "The logic in `updateHealthStatus()` defines 'good' health as a result of either `hasHealthyDiet` or `exercisesRegularly` being true (but not both). If an intervention changes `healthStatus` to 'good', it must set exactly one of these conditions to true, assuming the other is false.",
