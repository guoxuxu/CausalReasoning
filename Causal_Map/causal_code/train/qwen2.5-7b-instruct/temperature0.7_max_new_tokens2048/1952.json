  "Explanation": "External changes to 'status' in `processed_data` do not necessarily reflect the internal logic of setting 'status' based on 'education'. Such changes could be made independent of the 'education' conditions inside the function, and do not imply that all 'education' values are not 'College'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
