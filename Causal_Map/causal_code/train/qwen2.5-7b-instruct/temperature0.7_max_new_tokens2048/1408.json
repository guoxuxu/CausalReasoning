  "Explanation": "John’s decision not to wear a coat is affected by the feels_like temperature, which is a combination of actual temperature and humidity. Therefore, even with a moderate actual temperature, a high humidity can result in a higher feels_like temperature, leading to a decision to not wear a coat.",
