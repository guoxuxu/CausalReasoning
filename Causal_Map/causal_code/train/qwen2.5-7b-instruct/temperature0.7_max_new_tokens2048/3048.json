  "Problem": "def calculate_health(running, diet_quality, hours_of_sleep):\n    fitness = running * 0.3 + diet_quality * 0.5\n    health_score = fitness * 2 + hours_of_sleep * 0.8\n    return health_score\n\nhealth = calculate_health(running=3, diet_quality=8, hours_of_sleep=7)\",\n\nIf we fix `diet_quality` and `hours_of_sleep` at high values, and then increase `running`, will `health_score` increase?",
  "Explanation": "By holding `diet_quality` and `hours_of_sleep` constant at high levels, any increase in `running` will have a direct and isolated effect on increasing `health_score` through its effect on `fitness`. As `fitness` is made up partly of the `running` value, increasing `running` while keeping other factors constant will invariably increase `health_score`.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "running → fitness; fitness → health_score; diet_quality → fitness; diet_quality → health_score; hours_of_sleep → fitness; hours_of_sleep → health_score",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Increasing running will directly increase fitness, which in turn increases health_score. High diet_quality and hours_of_sleep also contribute to fitness and health_score, but the question focuses on the effect of increasing running."
