  "Explanation": "The analysis step (calculating the mean of the data) depends on the state of the data after it has been both potentially normalized and enhanced. Without further information, one cannot definitively determine from the analysis result alone whether normalization was specifically performed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
