  "Explanation": "Given an intervention where the safety valve is manually triggered (and hence we assume pressure over 200), the only condition left to satisfy for the alarm to go off is for the steam quality to be 'high', which directly correlates with the temperature being over 100 degrees. Therefore, if the alarm is still off, it implies the temperature did not exceed 100.",
