  "Explanation": "Lowering the initial temperature setting (assuming current settings mean a temperature of 25 degrees) below 25 would reduce the starting base temperature. Given the subsequent operations (increasing by 10 and decreasing by 5), the final temperature would not exceed the threshold, hence the power would remain 'OFF'. Therefore, the initial temperature directly influences the power state 'ON' without intervening in the operations.",
