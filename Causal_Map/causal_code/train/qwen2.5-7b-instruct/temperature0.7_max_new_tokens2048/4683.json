  "Explanation": "If 'age' is greater than 18, the 'adult' field is set to True. If also 'income' is greater than 50000, then being an adult ('adult' is True) leads to 'tax_bracket' being set to 'higher'. Hence, a higher age increases the potential for an individual to be in a 'higher' tax bracket if the income condition is met.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Age directly influences whether an individual is considered an adult, which in turn determines the tax bracket. Higher income also influences the tax bracket."
