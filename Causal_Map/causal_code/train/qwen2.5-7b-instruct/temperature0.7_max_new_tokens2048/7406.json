  "Problem": "def analyze_sales(data):\n  if data['weekday'] in ['Saturday', 'Sunday']:\n    adjustment_factor = 1.1\n  else:\n    adjustment_factor = 0.9\n  base_sales = data['base_sales']\n  adjusted_sales = base_sales * adjustment_factor\n  if adjusted_sales > 1000:\n    discount = 0.05\n  else:\n    discount = 0.02\n  final_price = adjusted_sales * (1 - discount)\n  return final_price\",\n\nIf observing a lower `final_price`, can we conclude it was not a weekend?",
  "Explanation": "A lower `final_price` could result from various factors such as lower `base_sales` or different adjustments and discounts applied, irrespective of whether it is a weekend or not. The relationship between `weekday` and `final_price` isn't deterministic solely based on `final_price` values.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "If the weekday is not Saturday or Sunday, the adjustment_factor will be 0.9, leading to a lower adjusted_sales which in turn results in a smaller discount and thus a lower final_price. Conversely, if the weekday is Saturday or Sunday, the adjustment_factor will be 1.1, increasing adjusted_sales, potentially resulting in a higher final_price unless adjusted_sales exceeds 1000."
