  "Explanation": "Unsatisfactory results could be due to multiple factors such as inadequate data cleaning in clean_data or issues in apply_model. Without controlling for these factors, inadequate training alone cannot be concluded as the sole cause.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
