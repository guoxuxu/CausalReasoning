  "Explanation": "Given that there are no withdrawals and an increase is observed in the balance, the logical inference under these circumstances is that a deposit operation was performed with a sufficient amount to exceed any potential previous balance, achieving the observed increase.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
