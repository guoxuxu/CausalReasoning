  "Explanation": "Yes, because according to the conditions set in the program, decreasing the rain likelihood usually involves increasing the temperature above the existing threshold, or reducing the humidity below a certain benchmark. Since the likelihood responds to these factors, an intervention that decreases likelihood implicates changes in temperature or humidity.",
