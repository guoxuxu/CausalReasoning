  "Explanation": "The code checks if the 'current_temp' is more than 5 degrees below 'desired_temp'. If this condition is true, it sets 'heater_on' to True and calls 'increase_temperature' to reduce the temperature difference. This is a direct causal relationship from 'current_temp' (cause) to 'heater_on' (effect).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "If the current temperature (current_temp) is significantly lower than the desired temperature (desired_temp), then the heater will likely be turned on (heater_on). The sensor reading determines the current temperature, which directly influences whether the heater is turned on."
