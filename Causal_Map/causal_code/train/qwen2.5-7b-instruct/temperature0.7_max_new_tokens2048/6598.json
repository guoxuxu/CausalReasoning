  "Problem": "def compute_metrics(num_sales, num_returns, advertising_budget):\n    revenue = num_sales * 100 - num_returns * 25\n    advertising_effectiveness = (num_sales / advertising_budget) if advertising_budget > 0 else 0\n    return revenue, advertising_effectiveness\",\n\nIf the number of sales increases, will the revenue also increase?",
  "Explanation": "The 'revenue' in the function is calculated using the formula 'num_sales * 100 - num_returns * 25'. An increase in 'num_sales' directly increases the first part of the formula, which increases the total revenue, assuming 'num_returns' remains constant.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
