  "Explanation": "Blocking simulateHeatWave prevents temperature increase related to a heat wave. The startRain method only increases humidity and decreases temperature under certain conditions, so it cannot cause an increase in temperature.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
