  "Explanation": "Resetting the advertising budget and observing unchanged total sales do not conclusively prove that the initial increase was solely due to advertising spent. There might be latent or unobserved variables affecting the sales, and without controlling or knowing these, the cause cannot be exclusively attributed to advertising.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
