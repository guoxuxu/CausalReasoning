  "Problem": "def process_data(data, x_factor=False): \n    processed = data**2 if x_factor else data**3 \n    if processed > 100: \n        result = True \n    else: \n        result = False \n    return result\",\n\nIf we manipulate 'x_factor' to True, will it affect 'result' assuming 'data' is constant?",
  "Explanation": "Changing 'x_factor' from False to True changes the operation on 'data' from cubing to squaring. For the same 'data', squaring usually results in a smaller number than cubing if 'data' > 1, possibly reducing 'processed' below the threshold of 100, which can change 'result' from True to False, or maintain it as False, depending on the original 'data' value.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Setting x_factor to True directly influences result by changing the processing of data. Data determines the value of processed, which then directly influences result."
