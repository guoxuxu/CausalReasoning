  "Problem": "class SalesPrediction { \n    double price; \n    int customerVisits;\n    public SalesPrediction(double price, int promoHeld) { \n        this.price = price; \n        this.customerVisits = promoHeld == 1 ?

  "Explanation": "Since sales are calculated as the product of price and customer visits, and customer visits are derived from price, an increase in price generally leads to an increase in sales even without any intervention, assuming customer visits adjustments remain proportional.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in price leads to a decrease in customer visits, which in turn leads to a decrease in sales. Therefore, without any intervention, an increase in price is not expected to generally increase sales."
