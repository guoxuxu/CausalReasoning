  "Explanation": "The method updateWeather can set the weather to raining if the temperature is below 15 degrees and it is already raining; otherwise, rain can stop irrespective of temperature drop. Thus, if it is raining, it does not automatically mean the temperature was precisely set below 20 degrees before rain was observed.",
