  "Explanation": "A 'Sunny' status requires the temperature to be above 20 degrees and not raining (based on the `getWeatherStatus` function). Though `temperatureRise` can contribute to this status after crossing 30 degrees, it is not the only way for the weather to be 'Sunny'; it can also happen just by having a temperature above 20 degrees with no rain, regardless of reaching 30 degrees.",
