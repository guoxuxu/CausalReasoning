  "Explanation": "In this code, a delay (leading to 'late' arrival) is only caused by rainy weather. Hence, observing 'late' implies that the cause (rainy weather, causing traffic delay) occurred.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
