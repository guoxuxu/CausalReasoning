  "Explanation": "A total cost of 7 means that the combined price and shipping cost sum up to 7. Given the logic of the code, the only path to achieving a total of 7 involves a scenario where the price is low enough (at or below 20) to merit a 2 shipping cost, summing together to precisely 7. Any effective discount or significantly different original price would disturb this precise balance, shifting the total cost as a result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If price is greater than 20, then shipping cost is 5; if 'discount' is present in data, price is adjusted by applying the discount; if price is less than or equal to 20, then shipping cost is 2."
