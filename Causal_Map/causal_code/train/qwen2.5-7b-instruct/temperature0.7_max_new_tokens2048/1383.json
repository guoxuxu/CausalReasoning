  "Explanation": "Increasing the order quantity increases total_items. If total_items remains below or equals 50, the discount stays at 0, and thus, increases the total_cost since more items remain at full price. If it crosses 50, the discount kicks in, which might change the scenario depending on the price points of the items, but typically, given the similar order settings, total cost should still increase, only at a reduced rate due to the discount.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If the total number of items ordered exceeds 50, a discount of 10% is applied, reducing the total cost. Otherwise, no discount is applied. The discount directly reduces the total cost."
