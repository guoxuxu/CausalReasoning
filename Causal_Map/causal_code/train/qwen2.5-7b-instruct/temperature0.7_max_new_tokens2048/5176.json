  "Explanation": "The scholarship status is updated based on the average of grades, which must be 85 or higher to have a scholarship. Therefore, if the student has a scholarship, it means their grades average is at least 85.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
