  "Explanation": "Increasing the temperature, while keeping a humidity level above 70, increases the likelihood of the condition 'Rainy' because the code checks if both temperature is above 20 and humidity is above 70 for it to be 'Rainy'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
