  "Problem": "def environment_simulation(temp, policy, energy_demand):\n    if temp > 30:\n        air_quality = 'Poor' if policy == 'Weak' else 'Moderate'\n    else:\n        air_quality = 'Good'\n    power_production = energy_demand * 1.1 if temp < 20 else energy_demand * 0.9\n    return air_quality, power_production\",\n\nIf temperature rises above 30 degrees without changing the policy, does the air quality always deteriorate?",
  "Explanation": "According to the code, if temperature is above 30 degrees, air quality becomes 'Poor' if the policy is 'Weak'. If the policy is stronger, air quality lowers but remains 'Moderate', suggesting a deterioration from 'Good' (under 30 degrees, where air quality is 'Good' regardless of policy).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
