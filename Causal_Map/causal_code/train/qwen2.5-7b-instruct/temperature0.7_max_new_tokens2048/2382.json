  "Explanation": "If the player’s health is 95 after playing more hours, and knowing that each hour reduces health by 1 point for players 18 or older, the first condition for health to be 95 originally (at 100 health) implies only 5 hours played. Under the code given, a health of 95 for a player aged 18 or older is not possible unless the intervention sets fewer hours, hence under normal circumstances the player must be younger than 18, where health decreases 2 points per hour.",
