  "Explanation": "'apply_discount' multiplies the price by a factor determined by subtracting 'discount_rate' from 1. Since 'discount_rate' can either be 0.0, 0.2, or 0.3, a price change alone doesn't indicate that the original price was necessarily above 20 since 'discount_rate' can be non-zero for prices below 20 as well.",

  "causal_map_integration": "If the price is less than 20, then the product is discounted with a rate of 30%. Applying the discount changes the price. Therefore, if apply_discount changes the price, the original price must have been less than 20."
