  "Problem": "{\n    \"PythonCode\": \"def increase_temperature(health_status, medication, outdoor_activity):\n    base_temp = 20\n    if health_status == 'sick':\n        temp_increase = 5\n    else:\n        temp_increase = 2\n\n    if medication == 'antipyretic':\n        temp_increase -= 3\n    if outdoor_activity == 'high':\n        temp_increase += 2\n\n    return base_temp + temp_increase\"\n  },\n\nIf a person is sick, will the temperature increase more than when they are healthy, ignoring other factors?",
  "Explanation": "The code increases the base temperature more when the person's health status is ‘sick’ compared to when they are healthy (5 degrees vs 2 degrees). Therefore, the temperature would increase more when a person is sick, not considering the effects of medication or outdoor activity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
