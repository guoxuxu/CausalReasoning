  "Explanation": "In the TrafficSystem class, the method changeLight(color) sets the traffic light color and directly influences the cars' movement. If the color is set to 'red', the carsMoving property is explicitly set to false, making the cars stop.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
