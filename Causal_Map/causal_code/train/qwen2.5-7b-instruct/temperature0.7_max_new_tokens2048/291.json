  "Problem": "def compute_health_index(age, diet_quality, exercise_frequency):\n    base_health_score = 100\n    if age > 50:\n        base_health_score -= (age - 50) * 0.75\n    if diet_quality < 3:\n        base_health_score -= 20\n    else:\n        base_health_score += diet_quality * 5\n    base_health_score += exercise_frequency * 10\n    return base_health_score\",\n\nIf diet quality ratings are adjusted so that each point contributes to an increase of 10 in the index, will this enhance the health index?",
  "Explanation": "If the coefficient of diet quality in the health index formula is increased, then for any given level of diet quality, the contribution to the health index increases, which results in a higher overall health index. This is a direct consequence of artificially modifying the influence of diet quality.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
