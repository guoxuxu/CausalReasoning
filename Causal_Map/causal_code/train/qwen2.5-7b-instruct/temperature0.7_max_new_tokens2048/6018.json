  "Explanation": "With intervention to hold the traffic lights green (ordinarily impossible with high density), and brakes still activating, it suggests brake activation was likely not related to traffic density, pointing to a secondary safety measure or system error, possibly under less predictable, cloudy conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Weather influences traffic density, which determines the traffic light signal. The traffic light signal affects whether emergency brakes are applied. An intervention to keep the traffic light green regardless of density would bypass the usual dependency on density. Given that the brakes were activated, it suggests the original signal was red, implying a density greater than 60, which typically occurs under rainy weather conditions. Therefore, without the intervention, the weather was likely rainy rather than sunny, but the question asks about cloudy instead of sunny. Thus, if the intervention kept the signal green, the weather could have been cloudy, making it less likely to be sunny."
