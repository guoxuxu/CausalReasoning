  "Explanation": "By intervening and setting the temperature to 85 degrees in winter, the activity will shift to 'swimming' since it surpasses the temperature threshold of 75 degrees needed for swimming despite the winter season.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The season determines the temperature, which in turn decides the activity. Setting the season to 'winter' and manually adjusting the temperature to 85 degrees would result in the activity being 'skiing'. However, this scenario is inconsistent because 85 degrees is not within the typical range for winter temperatures as defined in the code."
