  "Explanation": "A low score can result from other factors in the function such as poor health or low activity level, not just being over 50 years old.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
