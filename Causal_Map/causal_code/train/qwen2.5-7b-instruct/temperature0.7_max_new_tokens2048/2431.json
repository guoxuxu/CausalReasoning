  "Explanation": "Increasing the temperature (from cause) would decrease the ratio if the pressure remains constant because the ratio z is calculated as pressure divided by temperature, therefore, any increase in the denominator (temperature) with a constant numerator (pressure) decreases the value of z.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
