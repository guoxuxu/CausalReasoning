  "Explanation": "The reversal from a decrease in revenue to manipulating the number_of_shops does not guarantee a predictable adjustment in revenue, as revenue is dependent on both the number of customers and how much each is spending. Other factors like average spend per customer need to be considered, which are not necessarily affected by changes in shop numbers alone.",
