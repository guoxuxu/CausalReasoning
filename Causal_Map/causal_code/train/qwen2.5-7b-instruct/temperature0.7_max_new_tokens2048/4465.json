  "Problem": "def compute_sales_data(prices, units_sold, discount_rate, season):\n    if season == 'winter':\n        prices = [price * 0.9 for price in prices]  # Apply winter discount\n    total_sales = sum([price * unit for price, unit in zip(prices, units_sold)])\n    if discount_rate > 0:\n        total_sales *= (1 - discount_rate)\n    return total_sales\",\n\nIf an additional '10% off' intervention is applied to the prices in 'winter', will it now certainly cause 'total_sales' to decrease?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing an additional '10% off' discount will further lower the price per unit, which initially suggests that revenues from individual sales could be lower. However, the impact on 'total_sales' is ambiguous without considering changes in volume. If the lower prices lead to a significant increase in units sold, total sales could potentially increase or offset the price reductions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
