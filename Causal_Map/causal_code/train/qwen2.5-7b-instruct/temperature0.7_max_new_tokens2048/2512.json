  "Explanation": "A decrease in 'customer_satisfaction' could result from a lower 'product_quality' rating rather than changes in 'traffic'. Since 'customer_satisfaction' is also dependent on 'product_quality', a lower 'product_quality' can reduce 'customer_satisfaction' even if 'traffic' remains unchanged or increases.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Traffic directly influences sales, and sales directly influence customer satisfaction. Product quality directly influences customer satisfaction. Decreases in customer satisfaction could be due to decreases in sales, which may be caused by decreases in traffic or lower product quality."
