  "Problem": "def calculate_health_effects(smoking, diet_quality, exercise_frequency):\n    lung_cancer_risk = smoking * 0.3\n    heart_disease_risk = (smoking * 0.2) + (diet_quality * -0.1) + (exercise_frequency * -0.1)\n    life_expectancy = 80 - (lung_cancer_risk * 2) - (heart_disease_risk * 3)\n    return lung_cancer_risk, heart_disease_risk, life_expectancy\",\n\nIf an intervention increases a person's life expectancy, does this necessarily indicate a change in their exercise frequency?",
  "Explanation": "Life expectancy can be affected by multiple factors in this model, including smoking, diet quality, lung cancer risk, and heart disease risk. An increase in life expectancy might come from changes in any of these factors, not necessarily just exercise frequency.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
