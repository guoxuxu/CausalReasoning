  "Explanation": "Increasing savings improves the ability to secure approval under conditions where credit score and income alone do not suffice, specifically by meeting the additional condition of having savings greater than $5000 or modifying the loan amount ratio to savings.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Increasing an applicant's savings can lead to a higher likelihood of loan approval by either meeting the savings requirement or allowing for a larger requested loan amount, assuming the credit score and income meet the base approval criteria."
