  "Explanation": "In the provided TrafficSystem class, there is a conditional statement inside the increase_traffic function that activates the traffic lights when the number of cars exceeds 10, assuming the lights were not already on. The increase in cars is the direct cause for the traffic lights to turn on under these conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
