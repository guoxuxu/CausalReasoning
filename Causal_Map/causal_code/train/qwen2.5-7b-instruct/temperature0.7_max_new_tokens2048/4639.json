  "Explanation": "The function process_data relies on clean_data to fill missing age values and return the cleaned data which is then passed to enrich_data. Without clean_data, the subsequent steps cannot execute correctly.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The process_data function successfully completes without directly calling clean_data, as it internally calls clean_data to generate cleaned_data which is then used to generate enriched_data. Age being imputed in clean_data influences the creation of age_group in enrich_data."
