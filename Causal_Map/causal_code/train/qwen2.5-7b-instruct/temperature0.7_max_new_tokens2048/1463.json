  "Explanation": "Increasing 'data_input' leads to a higher 'adjusted_data' since it is multiplied by 10 in the function. If 'adjusted_data' exceeds 50, the function returns 'High', leading to the execution of 'print(\\\"Value is above threshold.\\\")'. Therefore, increasing 'data_input' causes an increase in the probability of the outcome.",
