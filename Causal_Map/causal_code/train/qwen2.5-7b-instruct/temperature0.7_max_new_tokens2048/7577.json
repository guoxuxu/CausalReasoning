  "Problem": "def compute_values(temp, pressure):\n    boiling_point = 100 + (pressure - 1) * 0.5\n    if temp > boiling_point:\n        state = 'Gas'\n    elif temp == boiling_point:\n        state = 'Transition'\n    else:\n        state = 'Liquid'\n    return state\",\n\nIf the temperature is increased and all else remains constant, will the state always be 'Gas'?",
  "Explanation": "The state depends on both temperature and its comparison to the boiling point. The boiling point is influenced by pressure, thus changing temperature alone doesn't guarantee that the state will always be 'Gas' unless it's above the boiling point regardless of the pressure.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Increasing the temperature leads to a change in state, with the boiling point acting as an intermediary. The pressure influences the boiling point, which in turn determines the state."
