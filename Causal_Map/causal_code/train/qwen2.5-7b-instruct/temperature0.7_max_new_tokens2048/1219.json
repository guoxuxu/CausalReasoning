  "Problem": "Python code provided above\",\n\nIf we observe an increase in wildlife population, can we infer policies were enacted?",
  "Explanation": "An increase in wildlife population can be influenced by both a different initial level of pollution and the enactment of policies. Since the wildlife population can increase or decrease due to changes in pollution (handled in 'increase_pollution' method), without exclusive information about pollution levels or direct observation of policy enactment, it's not definitive to infer that policies were enacted just from an increase in wildlife population.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in wildlife population may suggest policies were enacted to protect or enhance the wildlife."
