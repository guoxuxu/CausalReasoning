  "Explanation": "An increase in `final_sales` could result from it being a holiday (where sales are increased to 1.5 times the base_sales) or a marketing increase. Therefore, without additional information, we can't definitively attribute increased sales directly to increased marketing spend.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
