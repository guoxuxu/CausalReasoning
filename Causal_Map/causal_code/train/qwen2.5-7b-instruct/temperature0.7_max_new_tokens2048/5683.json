  "Explanation": "Adding an item with a positive price increases the 'total' because the 'add_item' method appends the item to the 'items' list and then calls 'update_total', which recalculates the total sum of all item prices in the cart.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
