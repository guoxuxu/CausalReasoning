  "Problem": "class HealthMonitor: def __init__(self, age, smoker): self.age = age; self.smoker = smoker; def risk_level(self): risk = 0; if self.age > 50: risk += 1; if self.smoker: risk += 2; return risk\",\n\nIf no intervention is made, does increasing the age attribute in the HealthMonitor instance increase the risk level?",
  "Explanation": "In the original code, the risk level increases by 1 if the age is greater than 50. Therefore, increasing the age beyond 50 naturally leads to a higher risk calculation without any intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
