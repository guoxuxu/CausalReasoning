  "Explanation": "With an intervention setting the temperature to 31, the temperature adjustment within the function (addition of 10) results in a final temperature of 41. Since this is greater than 30, the 'status' is set to 'high' as defined by the if condition in the code.",

  "causal_map_integration": "Setting 'temperature' to 31 in 'data' directly increases 'modified_data['temperature']' by 10, making it 41. Since 41 is greater than 30, 'modified_data['status']' is set to 'high'. Therefore, setting 'temperature' to 31 in 'data' causes 'status' to be 'high'."
