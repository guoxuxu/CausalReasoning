  "Explanation": "Enhancing teacher effectiveness through training increases the teacher effectiveness factor in `update_grades`. This improvement raises the additional learning per study hour, effectively boosting John's grades. As grades represent a substantial part of the success score formula in `predict_success`, the overall success score will show an improvement.",
