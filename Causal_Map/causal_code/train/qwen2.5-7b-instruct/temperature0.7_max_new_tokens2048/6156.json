  "Problem": "def compute_score(age, is_student, has_job):\n    if age < 18:\n        base_score = 20\n    elif age < 60:\n        base_score = 50\n    else:\n        base_score = 30\n\n    if is_student:\n        if age < 30:\n            bonus = 25\n        else:\n            bonus = 10\n    elif has_job:\n        bonus = 40\n    else:\n        bonus = 5\n\n    total_score = base_score + bonus\n    return total_score\",\n\nIf the compute_score function returned a higher value, does it imply the individual's age was less than 18 initially?",
  "Explanation": "A higher score can result from multiple changes besides age, such as transitioning from not having a job to having one or a shift in student status. Hence, only knowing that the score has increased does not definitively imply the individual’s age was initially below 18.",
