  "Explanation": "The mode setting alone does not guarantee that the values are larger. The changes in output values depend on both the mode and the magnitude of the factor. Even with 'incremental' mode, if the factor is significant, the updated values can be larger.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
