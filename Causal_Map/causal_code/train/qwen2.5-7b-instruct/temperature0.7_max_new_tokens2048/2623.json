  "Explanation": "Since tasks can only be added (and thus increase the task count) when the system is ready, a non-zero task count implies that the system must have been initialized (`systemReady` set to true) at some point. The reset system sets `systemReady` to false and task count to zero, so a non-zero task count implies initialization.",
