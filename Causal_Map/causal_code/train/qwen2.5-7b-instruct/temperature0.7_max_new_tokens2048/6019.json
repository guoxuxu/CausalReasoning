  "Explanation": "The initial speed is set in the '__init__' method. However, the 'accelerate' method directly modifies the speed by increasing it. Without this method call, the speed would remain at its initial value set during instantiation, which is '10'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
