  "Problem": "class Store {\n  int customers;\n  double price;\n  boolean promotion;\n\n  double calcSales() {\n    if (promotion) {\n      price *= 0.8;\n    }\n    return customers * price;\n  }\n\n  void setPromotion(boolean status) {\n    promotion = status;\n  }\n\n  void adjustPrice(double newPrice) {\n    if (newPrice > price) {\n      price = newPrice;\n    }\n  }\n}\",\n\nIf sales decrease, did the price or the number of customers necessarily decrease?",
  "Explanation": "A decrease in sales could be influenced by either a decrease in the number of customers or the price. Additionally, the initiation of a promotion, which reduces the price by 20%, could also lead to decreased sales, even if the number of customers remains the same.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
