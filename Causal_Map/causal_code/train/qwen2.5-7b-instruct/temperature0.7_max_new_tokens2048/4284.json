  "Problem": "def calculate_revenue(prices, units_sold, tax_rate):\n    base_revenue = sum([price * units for price, units in zip(prices, units_sold)])\n    tax = base_revenue * tax_rate\n    final_revenue = base_revenue + tax\n    return final_revenue\",\n\nIf 'tax_rate' is set to zero, and 'prices' increase, will 'final_revenue' still increase?",
  "Explanation": "Setting 'tax_rate' to zero effectively removes 'tax' from the revenue equation, making 'final_revenue' equivalent to 'base_revenue'. An increase in 'prices' will still increase 'base_revenue', directly raising the 'final_revenue', independent of tax considerations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "When prices increase, base revenue increases, which leads to higher final revenue. Tax rate affects tax amount, but if it is set to zero, changes in prices do not affect final revenue through tax."
