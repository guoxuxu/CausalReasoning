  "Explanation": "In the code, if the age is over 50, the risk variable is incremented by 0.5, independently of other factors. Thus, the health risk score increases when age exceeds 50.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
