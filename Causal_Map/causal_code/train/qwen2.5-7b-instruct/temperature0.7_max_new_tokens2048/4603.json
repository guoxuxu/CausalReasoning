  "Explanation": "Adding the 'Shirt' item involves calling `addItem`, which increases the 'total' based on the price of the item added. This is a direct causal effect of the `addItem` method on the 'total' variable.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
