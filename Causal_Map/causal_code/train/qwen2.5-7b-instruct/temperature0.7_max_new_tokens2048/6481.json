  "Explanation": "If a sales event is added such that its value equals the current remaining inventory, this sale would deplete the entire inventory, assuming no additional restocking occurs after this intervention. Since the final sales event exactly matches the available inventory, the resultant final inventory will be zero.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If a sale exceeds the current inventory, the inventory becomes zero; otherwise, it decreases by the sale amount. Restocking adds 100 to the inventory. Adding a sale equal to the current inventory will set it to zero before restocking."
