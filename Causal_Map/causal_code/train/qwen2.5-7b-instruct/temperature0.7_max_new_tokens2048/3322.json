  "Explanation": "The method 'updateWeather' adjusts the temperature by the 'deltaTemp' parameter. If 'deltaTemp' is not zero, then the temperature will change from its initial state of 20 degrees. The lack of rain only ensures that the temperature does not set to 5 under rainy and cold conditions, but other changes through 'deltaTemp' affect the temperature.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The updateWeather method adjusts the temperature, which can result in a weather status reporting a temperature other than 20 degrees if no rain is introduced. The value of isRaining influences whether the weather status reports as rainy and cold or clear and a specific temperature."
