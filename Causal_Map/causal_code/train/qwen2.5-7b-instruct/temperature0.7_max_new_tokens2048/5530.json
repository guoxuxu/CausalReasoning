  "Explanation": "Though the observed discount being 0% could result from an active subscription status preventing a discount offer, it might also be because the user is not an adult or because the `offer_discount` method was never called due to other unaccounted conditions or errors. Hence, this cannot definitively infer that a third-party intervention altered the subscription status.",
