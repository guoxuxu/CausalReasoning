  "Explanation": "Even if an intervention adjusts the price, a discounted_price of 80 does not solely indicate that is_member was True. The final price could also be adjusted by altering the base price. Without knowing the specific change to the price due to the intervention, is_member's value cannot be definitely known from the resulting price alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
