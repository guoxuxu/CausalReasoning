  "Explanation": "In the original code, the car's speed increases by 10 units when the traffic light is green, as indicated by the condition `if self.traffic_light == 'green'`. This direct conditional check in `car_moves` implies that the change in the light's status to green triggers the increase in speed.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
