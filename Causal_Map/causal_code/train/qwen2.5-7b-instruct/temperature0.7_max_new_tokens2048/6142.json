  "Explanation": "A consistently high fuel level could be due to frequent refueling, but it could also be a result of very little driving or having a highly fuel-efficient vehicle. Without intervening to observe driving habits or refueling frequency, one cannot conclusively deduce the cause.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
