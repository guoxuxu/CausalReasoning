  "Explanation": "Assuming the order quantity exceeds the set inventory level of 100 units for any item, it will trigger the restocking process for that item, as its count will drop below zero.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "An order for an item decreases its inventory level, which may trigger a restock if the inventory falls below zero. If an item is not initially in inventory, adding an order increases its negative inventory, also potentially leading to a restock. Setting all inventory levels to 100 units before processing an order prevents any restocks from being triggered by that order."
