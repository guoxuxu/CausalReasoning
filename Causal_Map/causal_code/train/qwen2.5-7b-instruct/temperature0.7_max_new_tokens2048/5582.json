  "Problem": "def process_data(x, y):\n    w = x * 2\n    z = w + y\n    return z\n\nresult = process_data(5, 3)\",\n\nKnowing that the result is equal to 'y', can we conclude 'x' was explicitly set to zero?",
  "Explanation": "Given the specific mechanics of this function, if the result exactly equals 'y', it implies that the value of 'w' is zero (since z = w + y and z = y means w = 0). Since 'w' is determined by 2*x, 'x' must be zero for 'w' to be zero.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
