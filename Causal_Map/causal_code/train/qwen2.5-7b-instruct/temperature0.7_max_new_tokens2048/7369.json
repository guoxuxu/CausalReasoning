  "Explanation": "Given the weather is sunny, the water_plants function will not activate the 'rainy' condition, leading to 'water with one liter' because no fertilizer is implicitly assumed. This amount of watering, as per the plant_growth function, leads to poor growth.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
