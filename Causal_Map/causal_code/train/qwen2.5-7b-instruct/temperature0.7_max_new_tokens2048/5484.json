  "Problem": "def update_inventory(sales, restock):\n    inventory = 100\n    for sale in sales:\n        inventory -= sale\n    for item in restock:\n        inventory += item\n    return inventory\",\n\nIf the 'inventory' decreases, does it imply that 'sales' have increased?",
  "Explanation": "A decrease in inventory can be due to an increase in sales or be caused by fewer items being restocked. Thus, a direct causal relation from inventory decrease to increased sales cannot be established without considering changes in 'restock'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
