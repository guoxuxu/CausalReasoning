  "Explanation": "After setting all data values to zero, the function's output depends solely on the intervention and the constant 10 added within the function. Since this output does not vary with changes in the original 'data' (because all values are zero), it's impossible to infer what the original values were from the result alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The original values of 'data' and 'filter_threshold' determine the 'result'. Setting all data values to zero will change the 'result', but without knowing the specific 'filter_threshold', it's impossible to deduce the exact original 'data' values from the 'result' alone."
