  "Explanation": "Knowing that the random factor is high does not allow us to determine the exact contribution of the marketing budget to sales, given that sales is a combination of both the marketing budget and the random factor. While a high random factor could result in higher sales outcomes, it's still unclear how effective the marketing budget is on its own unless the marketing budget's impact is isolated.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in the marketing budget directly increases new sales, and a high random factor also contributes to higher new sales, which in turn influences whether the output indicates success or suggests increasing the marketing budget."
