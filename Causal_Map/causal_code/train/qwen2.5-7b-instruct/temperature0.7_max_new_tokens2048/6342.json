  "Explanation": "A drop in consumer confidence could result from an automatic update in the interest rate (due to low global influence) or a manual intervention setting a lower rate. However, consumer confidence can also decrease naturally as per its adjustment method if the interest rate simply remains below or equal to 4—without necessarily implying a drop or any specific level of global influence at the last update.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If consumer confidence decreases below 0.8, then interest rates will be 4 or lower, which can happen due to either global influence being less than or equal to 0.5 during the last update rates adjustment or interest rates naturally being adjusted to 4 or lower based on other factors."
