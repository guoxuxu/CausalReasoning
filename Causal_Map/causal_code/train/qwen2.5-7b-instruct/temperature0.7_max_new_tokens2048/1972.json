  "Explanation": "Manually changing the output to 'Good Weather' does not necessarily relate to the internal state set by the climateChange variable, as this change could have been achieved by other manipulations of temperature or raining conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If climateChange is set to false, temperature will decrease by 3 and isRaining will be set to false, which can lead to 'Good Weather'. Conversely, if climateChange is set to true, temperature will increase by 5 and isRaining will be set to true, leading to 'Bad Weather'. Changing the output of getWeatherStatus to 'Good Weather' suggests that the conditions for 'Bad Weather' were not met, implying climateChange might have been set to false."
