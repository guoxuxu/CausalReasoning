  "Explanation": "The internal `temperature` being below 27 does not solely imply that the `external_temp` was above 30, since the `temperature` might naturally be lower or other interventions might have occurred affecting the temperature. The `check_system` method only evaluates the final state, not how it was reached.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
