  "Explanation": "Opening windows can influence the internal temperature independently of external weather conditions. Thus, even non-'sunny' conditions could lead to temperatures that necessitate turning the AC on, especially if the external temperature is generally high or if windows increase the internal heat gain.",

The target temperature also influences the current temperature, but the status is directly determined by comparing the current temperature to the target temperature."
