  "Explanation": "A higher than expected discounted_price suggests a lower discount was applied. With only two discount levels (20% for members, 10% for non-members), a higher price likely indicates the lower discount for non-members was applied, suggesting is_member might be False.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
