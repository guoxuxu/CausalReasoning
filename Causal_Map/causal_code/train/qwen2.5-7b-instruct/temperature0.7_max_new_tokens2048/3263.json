  "Explanation": "The 'average_purchase' value is calculated as the sum of purchase amounts divided by the number of logins, not by the number of purchase actions. An increase in 'average_purchase' could result from either higher purchase values per transaction or fewer logins, not necessarily from more purchase actions.",
