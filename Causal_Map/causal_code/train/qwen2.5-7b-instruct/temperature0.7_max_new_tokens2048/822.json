  "Explanation": "Assuming the newer machine learning model is indeed an improvement (more accurate, handles more data types, etc.), the predictions from the \\'process_data\\' function, which relies on \\'run_model\\' for its final output, are likely to improve.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
