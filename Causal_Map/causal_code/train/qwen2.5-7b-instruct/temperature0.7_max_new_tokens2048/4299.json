  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, demand_increment, advertising, season):\n    base_demand = 50\n    if season == 'high':\n        seasonal_factor = 1.5\n    else:\n        seasonal_factor = 1.0\n    demand = base_demand + demand_increment * seasonal_factor\n    if advertising > 20:\n        demand *= 1.2\n    sales = demand * price\n    return sales\",\n\nIf we set 'advertising' to a value greater than 20 and increase 'demand_increment', will 'sales' increase?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing 'advertising' to more than 20 triggers a condition in the code that multiplies 'demand' by 1.2, enhancing the impact of the original 'demand' increment. This intervention therefore leads to a significantly amplified increase in 'sales' due to the compounded impact of increased 'demand' and the effect of advertising.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
