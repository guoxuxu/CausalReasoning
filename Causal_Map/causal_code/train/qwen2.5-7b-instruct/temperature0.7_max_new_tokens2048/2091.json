  "Explanation": "Even if the water heater is repeatedly turned off, using a significant amount of water (more than 10 units) triggers a decrease in temperature by 10 degrees as per the 'use_water' method, which does not depend on whether the heater is on.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

An external intervention that turns off the heater after it is turned on prevents the temperature from increasing but does not affect the decrease in temperature when more than 10 units of water are used."
