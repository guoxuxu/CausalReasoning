  "Explanation": "A lower than expected 'total' might be caused by the application of a discount due to 'user_age' being under 18, but it could also be due to other factors not detailed in the code, such as perhaps an unaccounted reduction in 'price' or 'quantity'. One cannot conclusively infer the user's age based solely on the total.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If the price and quantity are included in data, they determine the total. A user's age less than 18 leads to a 10% discount, which reduces the total if the total is already calculated. Therefore, observing a lower total can suggest the user's age is under 18."
