  "Explanation": "A decrease in total_cost could result from either a decrease in the price or a decrease in the tax rate, or an increase in a Discount on a DiscountProduct instance. Without knowing which variable changed, we cannot directly infer that the decrease in total_cost was due to a decrease in price alone.",
