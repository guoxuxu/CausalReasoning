  "Explanation": "The weather condition is directly determined by the temperature. An increase in temperature could move the state from one temperature bracket to another in the 'determineWeather' method, hence changing the weather condition.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
