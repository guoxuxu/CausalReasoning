  "Explanation": "Modifying age to 30 would consistently classify an individual as an adult ('is_adult' is set to True). Thus, the 'tax_bracket' would then depend on 'income', if 'income' key exists, because 'is_adult' is true. Hence, the tax bracket would still potentially depend on income.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Setting age to 30 directly makes is_adult True, which then allows income to determine tax_bracket. Therefore, tax_bracket can still depend on income even if age is fixed at 30."
