  "Explanation": "An increase in total sales can occur either from an increase in the price per subscription or from an increase in the number of new subscriptions due to the calculation in 'updateSales'. Hence, an increase in total sales does not necessarily imply that the price per subscription has increased; it could also be due to an increase in the number of subscriptions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
