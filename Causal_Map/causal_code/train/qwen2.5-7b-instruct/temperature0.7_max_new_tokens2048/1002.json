  "Explanation": "Intervening by setting `penalty_enabled` to True activates the conditional penalty code block, which subtracts the minimum grade (penalty) from the `base_score`. Decreasing the base score indicates that the penalty was applied correctly.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
