  "Problem": "class Person: \n   def __init__(self, age): \n       self.age = age \n       self.driving_license = self.check_driving_license() \n   def check_driving_license(self): \n       if self.age >= 18: \n           return True \n       else: \n           return False \n\n   def apply_for_job(self, job_type): \n       if job_type == 'driver' and self.driving_license: \n           return 'Application Successful' \n       else: \n           return 'Application Unsuccessful'\n\njohn = Person(20) \njohn_job_status = john.apply_for_job('driver')\",\n\nIf John's age increases to 22, will this definitively ensure that he has a driving license, assuming he is re-evaluated?",
  "Explanation": "In the given code, the driving license is directly dependent on the person's age being 18 or above. Increasing John’s age from 20 to 22 still satisfies this condition, so he will continue to have a driving license if re-evaluated.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
