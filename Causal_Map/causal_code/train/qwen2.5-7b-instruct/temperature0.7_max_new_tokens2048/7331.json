  "Problem": "def sales_prediction(ad_budget, season):\n    base_sales = 100\n    if season == 'high':\n        seasonal_multiplier = 1.5\n    elif season == 'low':\n        seasonal_multiplier = 0.75\n    else:\n        seasonal_multiplier = 1.0\n    total_sales = base_sales * seasonal_multiplier + ad_budget * 0.3\n    return total_sales\",\n\nIf one could control the season to always be 'high', would this lead to an increase in total_sales when increasing the ad_budget?",
  "Explanation": "With the intervention of setting the season to 'high', the seasonal_multiplier is fixed at 1.5. Given this setup, any increase in the ad_budget will lead to a proportionate increase in the total_sales due to the additive contribution of ad_budget in the total_sales calculation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Increasing the ad_budget directly increases total_sales, and setting the season to 'high' increases total_sales through a higher seasonal_multiplier, which in turn also indirectly increases total_sales through the ad_budget's effect."
