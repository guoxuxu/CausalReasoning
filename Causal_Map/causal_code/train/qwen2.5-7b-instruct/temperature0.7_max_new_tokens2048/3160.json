  "Explanation": "The `update_traffic_light` method changes the state of the traffic light. According to `car_moves`, if this updated state is 'green', it leads to an increase in car speed by 10. Therefore, manually setting the light to green intervenes and causes the car to accelerate.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Manually changing the traffic light to green using `update_traffic_light` method causes the `car_moves` function to be executed, which in turn increases the car's speed by 10 units."
