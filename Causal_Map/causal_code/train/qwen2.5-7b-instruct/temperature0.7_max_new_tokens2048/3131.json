  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n    temperature = data.get('temp', 0) \n    humidity = data.get('humidity', 0) \n    adjusted_temp = temperature * 1.8 + 32 \n    comfort_index = adjusted_temp - 0.55 * (1 - humidity / 100) * (adjusted_temp - 58) \n    is_comfortable = comfort_index > 65 and humidity < 80 \n    return is_comfortable\",\n\nIf the 'is_comfortable' flag is true, can we infer that the original temperature was high?",
  "Explanation": "The 'is_comfortable' flag being true depends on both a suitable 'comfort_index' and humidity below 80%. The 'comfort_index' is influenced by both temperature and humidity. A cool environment with very low humidity can also produce a comfortable index above 65. Hence, a true 'is_comfortable' flag doesn't necessarily mean the temperature was high; it could also mean that humidity was managed well relative to a moderate temperature.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
