  "Explanation": "From effect (no rain) to cause (temperature) with intervention on humidity, if setting humidity above 70 leads to rain when it was not raining originally, it implies that the temperature must have been above 20 degrees; otherwise, rain would have been predicted earlier.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "humidity above 70 and temperature below 20 directly cause rain. If it was not raining, setting humidity above 70 does not imply temperature was originally above 20 degrees Celsius, as rain can also be caused by temperature below 20 regardless of humidity."
