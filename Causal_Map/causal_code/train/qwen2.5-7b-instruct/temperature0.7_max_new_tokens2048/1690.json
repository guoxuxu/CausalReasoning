  "Problem": "def compute_sales(discount, quantity, base_price):\n\\tif discount > 0:\n\\t\\tfinal_price = base_price * (1 - discount / 100)\n\\telse:\n\\t\\tfinal_price = base_price\n\\ttotal_sales = final_price * quantity\n\\tsurplus = total_sales * 0.05\n\\treturn total_sales, surplus\n\nsales, extra = compute_sales(10, 50, 20)\",\n\nBy witnessing an increase in surplus, can we conclude the discount has been increased?",
  "Explanation": "An increase in surplus could potentially result from higher total sales which could be influenced by factors other than just an increased discount, such as increased demand or a larger quantity being sold. The scenario requires an understanding of how interventions in other areas (like marketing or product availability) might have occurred.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in discount leads to a lower final price, which results in higher total sales, thereby increasing the surplus."
