  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(items, promo_code):\n    total = sum(item['price'] * item['quantity'] for item in items)\n    discount_rate = 0.1 if promo_code == 'SAVE10' else 0.2 if promo_code =='SAVE20' else 0\n    return total * (1 - discount_rate)\",\n\nIf the discount applied is higher, can we infer that the promo code used was 'SAVE20'?",
  "Explanation": "Yes, we can infer this because among the preset promo codes, only 'SAVE20' results in a higher discount rate of 0.2, compared to 'SAVE10' which provides a lower rate of 0.1 or no code which provides no discount.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
