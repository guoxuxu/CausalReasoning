  "Explanation": "When the adjustment is always activated at temperatures greater than 20, at a temperature of 25 the score, initially 70, would increase by an additional 15 due to the true condition of adjustment, resulting in a score of 85.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Temperature directly influences score through adjustment. When temperature is greater than 20, score increases by 85 if adjustment is activated, otherwise it remains at 70. When temperature is less than or equal to 20, score decreases to 40 if adjustment is activated, otherwise it remains at 50."
