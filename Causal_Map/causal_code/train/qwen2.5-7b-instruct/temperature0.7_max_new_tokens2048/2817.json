  "Explanation": "Although setting 'cond' to True doubles values, which makes positive numbers even larger, setting it to False halves the values. Depending on the original data (e.g., large positive numbers), even halved values could still be all positive, making it incorrect to assume that 'cond' must have been True just from positive results.",
