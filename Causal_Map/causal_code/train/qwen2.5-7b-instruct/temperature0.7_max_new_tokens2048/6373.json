  "Problem": "def update_prices(prices, rate_increase, special_deal, day_of_week):\n    if day_of_week == 'Monday':\n        new_prices = {item: price * 1.05 for item, price in prices.items()}\n    else:\n        new_prices = {item: price * (1 + rate_increase) for item, price in prices.items()}\n    if special_deal:\n        new_prices = {item: price * 0.9 for item, price in new_prices.items()}\n    return new_prices\",\n\nIf it is not Monday and you apply a temporary promotion ('special_deal' is True for one operation), will this affect the consistent pattern of 'new_prices'?",
  "Explanation": "Activating 'special_deal', even temporarily, will result in applying a 10% discount to all items only during the intervention. This temporarily alters the usual pricing pattern, making prices lower than usual for the duration of the special deal.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The day of the week, rate increase, and whether a special deal is applied each cause changes to the new prices."
