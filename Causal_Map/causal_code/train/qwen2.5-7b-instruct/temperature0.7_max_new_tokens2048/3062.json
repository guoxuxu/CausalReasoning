  "Explanation": "Increasing values in data_sequence would lead to either similar or higher values in processed_data (since only numbers greater than 5 are tripled), which raises the overall sum and potentially the average, given the size of processed_data remains constant or increases. This results in a higher average value being calculated and printed in the analyze_data function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
