  "Explanation": "Temperature drops if it is currently raining, not necessarily only if it rained the previous day. The effect observed (temperature drop) can be caused by rain on the same day as observed by updateWeather method logic.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
