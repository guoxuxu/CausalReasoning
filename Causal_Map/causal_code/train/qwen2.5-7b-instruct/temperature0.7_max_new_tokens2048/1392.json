  "Explanation": "A decrease in `net_profit` could be due to either an increase in `losses`, a decrease in `sales`, or both. Without more detailed data on `sales` and `losses`, it is not possible to attribute the cause solely to an increase in `losses`.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If losses increase, profit decreases, which leads to a decrease in net_profit. Therefore, if net_profit decreased, it is likely that losses increased, but this cannot be definitively stated without additional data to rule out other potential changes such as sales fluctuations."
