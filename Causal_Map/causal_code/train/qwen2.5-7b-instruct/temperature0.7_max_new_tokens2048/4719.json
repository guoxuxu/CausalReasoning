  "Explanation": "While the method 'increaseTemperature' can lead to a scenario where it's more likely to rain, the increase in temperature itself (within the method 'changeWeather') directly affects the 'isRaining' flag only under specific conditions (below 0 or above 30 degrees). The method 'willItRainLater' checks if rain is likely due to temperature being greater than 20, however, this is a probabilistic forecast and not a direct causation.",
