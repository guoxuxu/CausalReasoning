  "Explanation": "The method 'take_medicine' checks if the medication is a 'beta_blocker', and if so, reduces the heart rate by 10. This intervention (taking a 'beta_blocker') specifically counters the heart rate increase from drinking coffee (or other causes), demonstrating the impact of cause (taking 'beta_blocker') to effect (decreased heart rate) even with another intervening factor (such as recent coffee intake).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
