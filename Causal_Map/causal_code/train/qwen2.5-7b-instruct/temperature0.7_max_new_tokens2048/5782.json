  "Explanation": "Low productivity can be due to a 'sad' or 'neutral' mood, which could be caused by any type of weather except possibly 'sunny', according to the mood determination logic. Therefore, low productivity alone isn't sufficient to conclude it was a rainy day without considering the mood.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
