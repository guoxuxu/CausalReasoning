  "Explanation": "The `temperature` inside the control system increases not just from the heater being automatically turned on due to the temperature being below 20 but also because the `temperature` is directly modified by the difference `external_temp - 20`. Thus, if `external_temp` goes up, the corresponding term `(external_temp - 20)` becomes larger, directly increasing the `temperature` even without the heater's influence.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in external_temp generally leads to an increase in temperature, unless the temperature is already above 20, in which case the heater will turn off, causing the temperature to decrease slightly."
