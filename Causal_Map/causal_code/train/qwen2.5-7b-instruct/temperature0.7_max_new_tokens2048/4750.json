  "Explanation": "From effect to cause with intervention: Knowing total decreased emissions alone doesn't provide enough information about the individual contributions from industry or cars specific reduction unless additional information about the other component or the distribution of the reduction is known.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
