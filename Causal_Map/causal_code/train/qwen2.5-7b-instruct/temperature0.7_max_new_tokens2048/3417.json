  "Explanation": "While 'userID' being less than 1000 is one reason for 'validated' being False, 'validated' could also be False because of a 'status' of 'fail' (when 'error' is present). Therefore, without additional information about 'status', one cannot infer the value of 'userID' simply from 'validated' being False.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "If 'error' is present, then 'status' is set to 'fail'. Otherwise, 'status' is 'success' and 'processed' is set to True. For 'validated' to be True, 'status' must be 'success', 'userID' must be provided, and 'userID' must be greater than 1000. Therefore, if 'validated' is False, it can be inferred with certainty that 'userID' was below or equal to 1000."
