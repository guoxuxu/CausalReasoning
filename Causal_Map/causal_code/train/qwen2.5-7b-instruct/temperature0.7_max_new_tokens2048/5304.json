  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(prices, status, season):\n    if status == 'VIP':\n        base_discount = 0.2\n    else:\n        base_discount = 0.05\n\n    if season == 'holiday':\n        seasonal_discount = 0.1\n    else:\n        seasonal_discount = 0.03\n\n    total_discount = base_discount + seasonal_discount\n    discounted_prices = [price * (1 - total_discount) for price in prices]\n    return discounted_prices\",\n\nIf the discounted prices are lower, does it imply the customer must be a VIP?",
  "Explanation": "Lower discounted prices might suggest a VIP status due to higher base discounts, but they can also be influenced by the seasonal discount. For instance, prices could also be lower because of higher seasonal discounts during holidays, regardless of the VIP status.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
