  "Explanation": "Manually setting the temperature to 25 degrees does not guarantee a 'sunny' weather status because the weather can still be 'cloudy' if it's raining. The 'raining' boolean needs to be false as well to achieve a 'sunny' status, hence a single intervention on temperature is insufficient.",
