  "Problem": "{\n    \"python\": \"import random\ndef foo(x):\n  y = x * 10\n  if y > 50:\n    z = y + 20\n  else:\n    z = y - 20\n  return z\ndef main():\n  x = random.randint(1, 10)\n  result = foo(x)\n  print('Result:', result)\nmain()\",\n    \"description\": \"The function `foo` takes an integer `x`, multiplies it by 10 to get `y`, and depends on `y`'s value to either add or subtract 20 to get `z`. The main function generates a random number between 1 and 10, calls `foo` with this number, and prints the result.\"\n  },\n\nIf we change the function to always add 20 to `y`, will higher values of `x` always result in higher values of `z`?",
  "Explanation": "By modifying the function to always add 20 to `y` (removing the conditional), the relationship between `x` and `z` becomes linear and directly proportional, where `z = x * 10 + 20`. Thus, increasing `x` always increases `z`.",
