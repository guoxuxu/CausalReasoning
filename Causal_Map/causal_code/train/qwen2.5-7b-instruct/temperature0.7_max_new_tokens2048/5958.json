  "Explanation": "A speed of zero could occur under various conditions: either the engine has never been started, the engine was stopped, or the engine is running but the vehicle has not been accelerated. Thus, we cannot determine solely from a zero speed that stopEngine was necessarily called.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
