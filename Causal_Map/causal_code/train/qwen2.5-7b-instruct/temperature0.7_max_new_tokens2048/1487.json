  "Explanation": "Changes in the base_price are not reflected unless the object is re-instantiated or calculate_final_price is explicitly called as base_price is set during the instantiation and used to calculate sales_price. Since neither condition is met without execute apply_promotion, the sales_price remains constant.",
