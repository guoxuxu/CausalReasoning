  "Explanation": "Increasing the thermostat_setting does not necessarily mean that the adjusted_temperature will increase. The effect of the adjustment depends on the relation between the current_temperature and the new thermostat_setting. If the current_temperature was already near or above the original setting, increasing the setting might not change the adjusted temperature or might even decrease it if the new setting overshoots.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Increasing the thermostat_setting may lead to an increase in adjusted_temperature, but the actual change depends on the current_temperature. If the current_temperature is far from the thermostat_setting, increasing it will likely cause an adjustment. Otherwise, the adjustment might be minimal or non-existent."
