  "Explanation": "While the function 'drink_water' leads to a decrease in heart rate when more than 2 liters are consumed, observing a decreased heart rate cannot conclusively say whether it was caused specifically by drinking water as different variables such as resting or exercising could also involve interactions affecting the heart rate.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
