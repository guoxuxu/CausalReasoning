  "Explanation": "Reducing sales directly, perhaps by setting base_sales lower or manipulating the economic_factor or marketing investment artificially, does not imply that the economic factor has to reduce naturally. The economic_factor's influence remains independent of direct interventions on sales output unless specifically targeted.",
