  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator { constructor(temperature, humidity, windSpeed) { this.temperature = temperature; this.humidity = humidity; this.windSpeed = windSpeed; } forecastWeather() { if (this.temperature > 20) { if (this.humidity > 50) return 'rainy'; else return 'sunny'; } else if (this.windSpeed > 15) return 'stormy'; return 'cloudy'; } static interveneHumidity(weather, newHumidity) { weather.humidity = newHumidity; return weather.forecastWeather(); } }\",\n\nIf we manually set the humidity to 80% in a scenario where the temperature is over 20 degrees Celsius, will the forecast change to 'rainy'?",
  "Explanation": "Using the interveneHumidity method changes the humidity attribute of the WeatherSimulator instance. When humidity is increased to 80% while the temperature remains over 20, the forecasting logic in forecastWeather method will now result in 'rainy', based on the temperature and updated humidity conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
