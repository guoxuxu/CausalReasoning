  "Explanation": "An increase in predicted_sales could be due to changes in either ad_spend, which could affect the multiplier without any changes in economic growth, or sufficient economic growth reaching or exceeding the 2.0 threshold, regardless of changes in ad expenditure.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
