  "Explanation": "In the code, increasing ad_spend over 50000 alters the sales_multipler from 1.0 or 1.5 to either 2.0 or 2.5. Since the base_sales_volume is constant, this change would directly increase predicted_sales.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
