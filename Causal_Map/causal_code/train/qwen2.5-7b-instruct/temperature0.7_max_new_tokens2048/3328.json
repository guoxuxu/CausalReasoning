  "Explanation": "Setting 'tax_percentage' to zero removes the tax component, thus making 'total_tax' equal to 0. This results in 'final_revenue' equaling 'total_sales', which is simply the sum of 'sales_figures'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Sales data directly determines total sales, which then directly contributes to final revenue; tax rate directly influences total tax, which also directly contributes to final revenue."
