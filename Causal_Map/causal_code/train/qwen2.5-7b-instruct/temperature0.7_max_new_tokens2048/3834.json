  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(items, coupon_code=None):\n    total = sum(item['price'] * item['quantity'] for item in items)\n    discount_rate = 0.1 if coupon_code == '10OFF' else 0.05 if coupon_code == '5OFF' else 0\n    discount = total * discount_rate\n    total_after_discount = total - discount\n    return total_after_discount\",\n\nIf the quantity of an item in the list is increased, will the total cost before applying the discount increase?",
  "Explanation": "In the original code, the total cost before discount is calculated by summing the product of 'price' and 'quantity' for each item. Increasing the 'quantity' will directly increase the product, hence increasing the total sum.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
