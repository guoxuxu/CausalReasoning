  "Explanation": "When the external temperature is below 0, the heatOn flag is set to true. As per the code logic, when heatOn is true, the current temperature is increased by 5. Therefore, the current temperature will increase.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
