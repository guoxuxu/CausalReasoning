  "Problem": "int calculateInterest(int principal, int rate, int time) { int interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100; return interest; } int main() { int principal = 10000; int rate = 5; int time = 3; int interest = calculateInterest(principal, rate, time); int totalAmount = principal + interest; return totalAmount; }\",\n\nIf we set the time parameter to zero, will the totalAmount equal the principal amount irrespective of the principal or rate values?",
  "Explanation": "Setting time to zero results in zero interest (since interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100 and anything times zero is zero), and thus the totalAmount will be equal only to the principal, regardless of the values of principal or rate.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Setting the time parameter to zero reduces the interest, which in turn reduces the totalAmount to equal the principal."
