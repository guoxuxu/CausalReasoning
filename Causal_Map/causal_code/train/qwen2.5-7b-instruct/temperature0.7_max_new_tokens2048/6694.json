  "Explanation": "According to the method willItRain(), rain is more likely when it is cloudy and the temperature is below 20. Decreasing the temperature without altering the cloudy status (assuming it is already true) would increase the probability of meeting both conditions for rain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
