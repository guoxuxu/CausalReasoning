  "Explanation": "Increasing the vaccination rate increases the immunity level according to the calculate_immunity method. Since a higher immunity level can lead to 'pathogen contained' if exceeding a threshold (in this case 100), augmenting the vaccination rate would more likely result in containing the pathogen.",
