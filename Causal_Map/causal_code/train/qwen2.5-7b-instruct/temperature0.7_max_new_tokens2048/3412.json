'Healthy' : 'Unhealthy'; } } const myGarden = new Plant(); myGarden.water(); myGarden.soakSun(); myGarden.dayPasses(); const plantStatus = myGarden.getStatus();\",\n\nIf an operational tweak is made to increase the water added by 'water()' from 5 units to 7 units, will a single call to 'water()' suffice to keep the plant healthy after 'dayPasses()' is called?",
  "Explanation": "Currently, a single call of 'water()' adds 5 units and 'dayPasses()' subtracts 4 units, which barely affects the plant's health positively. Increasing water added by 'water()' to 7 units results in a net gain in water level even after 'dayPasses()' (7-4=3 units). Therefore, this intervention (increasing water units) enables a single watering to maintain or improve the plant's health after a day passes.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Increasing the water added by 'water()' from 5 units to 7 units will raise the water level, which will prevent the water level from dropping below 10 units when 'dayPasses()' is called, thus keeping the plant healthy."
