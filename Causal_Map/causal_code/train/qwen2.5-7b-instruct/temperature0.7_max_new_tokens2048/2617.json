  "Explanation": "While the ability to drive a further distance after observing a reduced capability could imply refueling, it’s not definitive. The car might have had enough fuel for the extended drive from the beginning or there might have been another intervention affecting the outcome, like reduced fuel consumption due to external factors.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
