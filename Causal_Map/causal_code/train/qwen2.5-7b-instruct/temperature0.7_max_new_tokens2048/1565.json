  "Explanation": "By increasing the 'threshold_value' manually to 30, the check_stock function will return false (since the current stock, 5, is less than 30), and thus, a smaller quantity (10 units in this case) will be added to the stock.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Increasing the threshold_value directly causes need_restock to be False, which in turn prevents oranges from being restocked immediately. Order cancellation can also decrease inventory['oranges'], but it is not directly caused by threshold_value."
