  "Explanation": "Setting 'heater_on' to True does not activate the heater or control temperature directly. The code's logic requires that 'increase_temperature' or 'decrease_temperature' be called, which are only triggered under specific temperature conditions. Manually setting 'heater_on' True won't invoke these methods without the right temperature conditions.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Setting 'heater_on' to True directly increases the temperature, which in turn raises the current temperature. Conversely, the current temperature decreases when the temperature is decreased. The desired temperature influences both increasing and decreasing temperature actions."
