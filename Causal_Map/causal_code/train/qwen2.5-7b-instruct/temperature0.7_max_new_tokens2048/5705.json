  "Problem": "class WeatherManager {\n    int forecastTemp;\n\n    public WeatherManager(int currentTemp) {\n        if (currentTemp < 15) {\n            forecastTemp = 10;\n        } else {\n            forecastTemp = 25;\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void applyHeatWave() {\n        forecastTemp += 5;\n    }\n\n    public boolean isCold() {\n        return forecastTemp < 20;\n    }\n}\",\n\nIf a heat wave is applied, will the forecast temperature necessarily be above 20?",
  "Explanation": "Applying a heat wave adds 5 to the `forecastTemp`. If the original `forecastTemp` was set at 10 (under 15 degrees initial temp), adding 5 results in 15; while if it starts at 25 (at least 15 degrees or higher initial temp), it increases to 30. Both scenarios post-heat wave yield a temperature that is still above 20, which indicates it will not be considered 'cold' under the `isCold` condition.",
