  "Explanation": "Setting the year to 2021 triggers the condition that multiplies the sales by 1.1 due to the year being later than 2020 in the code, directly increasing the sales figure by 10%.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
