  "Explanation": "Setting `exercisesRegularly` to true and then updating the diet to 'healthy' will make both `hasHealthyDiet` and `exercisesRegularly` true. As per the logic in `updateHealthStatus()`, this combination guarantees an 'excellent' healthStatus.",

An excellent health status requires both conditions, but setting exercisesRegularly to true and then calling updateDiet('healthy') can achieve it."
