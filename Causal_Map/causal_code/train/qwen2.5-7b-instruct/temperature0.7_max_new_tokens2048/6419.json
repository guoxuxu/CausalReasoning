  "Explanation": "The code establishes a direct relationship where popularity is derived by adding a normal distribution centered at zero to the initial influence. Therefore, increasing influence directly increases the expected value of popularity, depicting a causal relationship from cause (influence) to effect (popularity) without intervention.",
