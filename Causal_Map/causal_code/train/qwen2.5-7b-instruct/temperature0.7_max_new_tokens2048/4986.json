  "Explanation": "With every item showing a price reduction of exactly 25%, the only possible configuration in the given code is where 'is_member' is True (initial discount_rate = 0.05) and 'promo_code' is 'SAVE20' (which adds an extra 0.20 to the discount rate). This combination would result in a total discount_rate of 0.25. There are no other code paths that produce a 25% discount.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If the user is a member, the discount rate is 5%. Using the promo code 'SAVE20' increases the discount rate by 20%. The final price is calculated by applying the discount rate to the original price."
