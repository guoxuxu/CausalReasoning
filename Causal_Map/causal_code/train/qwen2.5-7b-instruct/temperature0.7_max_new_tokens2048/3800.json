  "Explanation": "Adding a heat wave to 25 degrees increases temperature to 30 degrees; setting humidity to 95 triggers the temperature to decrease by 2 degrees due to the humidity adjustment rule. Hence, the temperature falls to 28 degrees, resulting in mild weather according to the report conditions.",
