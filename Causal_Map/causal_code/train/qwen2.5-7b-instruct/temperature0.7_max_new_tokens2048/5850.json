  "Explanation": "The health index not increasing can imply multiple scenarios: the patient may not have had 'fever', the treatment might not have efficacy, or the treatment was not administered at all. As such, we can't conclusively say that it was due to the treatment not being administered or inefficacy without more information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
