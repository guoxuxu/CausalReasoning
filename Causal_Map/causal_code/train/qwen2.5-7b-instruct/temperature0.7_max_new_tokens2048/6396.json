  "Explanation": "Sprinklers activation only occurs if it's not raining and the temperature exceeds 30 degrees. However, there may be other unmodeled reasons for sprinklers to operate, and their activation does not necessarily imply it is not raining without further context, such as a malfunction or manual operation.",
