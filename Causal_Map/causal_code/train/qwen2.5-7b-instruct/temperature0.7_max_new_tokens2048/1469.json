  "Explanation": "Setting the temperature directly to 99 allows the subsequent call to adjust_temperature (+2) to set the temperature precisely at 100. Without setting it to 99, other initial values might have caused different outcomes.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
