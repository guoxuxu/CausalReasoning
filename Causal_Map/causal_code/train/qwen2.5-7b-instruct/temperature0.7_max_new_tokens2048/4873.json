  "Explanation": "Manual increase of `processed_data` by directly adjusting `raw_data` inside `process_data` means that independently `processed_data` increases. Since `evaluate_score` uses `processed_data` to determine `final_score` and when `adjustment` is True, `add_bonus` can further increase `final_score`, ensuring an increase overall.",
