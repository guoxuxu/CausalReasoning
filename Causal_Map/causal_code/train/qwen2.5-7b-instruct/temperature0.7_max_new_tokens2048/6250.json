  "Problem": "Provided in the Description\",\n\nCould observing an increased final_discount imply that the loyalty_discount specifically has increased?",
  "Explanation": "An increase in final_discount can be attributed to multiple factors such as an initial higher base price leading to a high_price_discount, or other promotions reflected in the initial 'discount' value. Without specifically isolating loyalty points, no clear causal inference can be made about the loyalty_discount itself contributing to the observed effect.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in loyalty_discount can lead to an increase in final_discount, but observing an increased final_discount does not necessarily imply that the loyalty_discount specifically has increased."
