  "Problem": "def process_orders(order_data):\n    total_items = sum([order['quantity'] for order in order_data])\n    if total_items > 50:\n        discount = 0.1\n    else:\n        discount = 0\n    total_cost = sum([order['quantity'] * order['price'] * (1 - discount) for order in order_data])\n    return total_cost\",\n\nIf the total cost decreases, can we infer that a discount was applied?",
  "Explanation": "A decrease in total cost cannot definitively confirm that a discount was applied. The total cost might decrease due to a reduction in the quantity or price of the items ordered. Decreased total cost is consistent with but not exclusive to the application of a discount.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If the total number of items ordered exceeds 50, a discount of 10% is applied, which reduces the total cost."
