  "Explanation": "Increasing x will increase y linearly (y = x * 2). As y increases, z also increases linearly (z = y + 3). Whether z > 10 or not, result is always directly dependent on the value of z (either result = z - 5 or result = z + 5). Therefore, as x increases, result also increases.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
