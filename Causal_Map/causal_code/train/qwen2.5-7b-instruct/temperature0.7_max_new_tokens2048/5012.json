  "Explanation": "A decrease in 'current_temp' could be due to 'is_heating_on' being True and the temperature being above the desired temperature plus the threshold. However, the decrease could also happen naturally or due to other unmodeled factors when heating is off, as the code does not explicitly handle the cooling process when 'is_heating_on' is False. Therefore, we cannot conclusively determine the state of 'is_heating_on' solely based on a decrease in temperature.",
