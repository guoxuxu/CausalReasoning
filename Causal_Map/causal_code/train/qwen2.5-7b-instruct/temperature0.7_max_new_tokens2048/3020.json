  "Explanation": "Intervening to set the mood to happy decouples the mood from the actual weather state. Since productivity directly relies on the mood status (is_happy method in the Mood class), this will directly increase productivity regardless of temperature and weather conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
