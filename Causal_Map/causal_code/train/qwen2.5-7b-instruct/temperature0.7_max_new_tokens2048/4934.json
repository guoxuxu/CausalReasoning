  "Explanation": "Given an intervention that reduces the tax rate, and observing a lower tax amount consequently, it is plausible to infer the category might have been changed to 'Book' which attracts a lower tax rate (0.1) compared to other categories (0.15).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If the tax amount is lower, it can be inferred that the product was changed to the 'Book' category, as books have a lower tax rate of 10% compared to 15% for other categories."
