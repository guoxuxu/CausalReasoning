  "Explanation": "The final price can decrease due to other reasons such as changes in item prices, increased quantity of cheaper items, or the addition of more robust discount schemes beyond altering a single discount rule.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
