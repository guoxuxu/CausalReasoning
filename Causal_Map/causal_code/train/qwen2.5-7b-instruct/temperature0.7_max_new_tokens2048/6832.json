  "Problem": "def adjust_temperature(room_temperature, thermostat_setting):\n    if room_temperature < thermostat_setting:\n        heating_status = 'on'\n    else:\n        heating_status = 'off'\n    if heating_status == 'on':\n        room_temperature += 5\n    return room_temperature\",\n\nIf an intervention sets the heating_status to 'on' regardless of the thermostat_setting, will the room_temperature necessarily increase?",
  "Explanation": "Forcing the heating_status to 'on' independently of the thermostat_setting leads to a direct increase of the room_temperature by 5 degrees. This is a direct intervention on the heating system bypassing the natural thermostat control logic.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
