  "Explanation": "From cause to effect without intervention: When the input list is empty, the functions min() and max() will not find any values to operate on, and thus 'minimum' and 'maximum' are set to None. Consequently, the operation to calculate 'range' also fails and 'range' doesn't get added to the dictionary.",
