  "Explanation": "An increase in variance can occur from changes in the original score values themselves, not solely from changes in the quality factor. The variance depends on how spread out the scores are, not just on how they are scaled.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
