  "Explanation": "While the 'car_speed' method sets a car's speed to 0 if its corresponding light is red, a red light does not guarantee that all cars controlled by other lights are stationary. Other lights might be green, allowing associated cars to move.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
