  "Explanation": "In the code, the method 'adjust_humidity' increases humidity and recalculates the cloud_cover based on this new humidity. If humidity reaches above 80, the weather status changes to 'rainy'. Hence, increasing humidity can directly cause a change in the weather status to 'rainy' without any other intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
