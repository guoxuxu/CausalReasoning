  "Explanation": "With the intervention changing the age threshold for categorization to under 20, a 19-year-old would fail the new check of being less than 20 years old, thus labeled as 'minor'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
