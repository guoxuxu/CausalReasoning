  "Problem": "\n    sales = [100, 200, 150, 300]\n    prices = [20, 15, 18, 10]\n    discount_events = [0, 1, 0, 1]\n\n    def calculate_revenue(sales, prices):\n        return [x*y for x, y in zip(sales, prices)]\n    \n    def apply_discount(prices, discount_events, discount_rate=0.1):\n        return [p * (1 - discount_rate) if e == 1 else p for p, e in zip(prices, discount_events)]\n\n    discounted_prices = apply_discount(prices, discount_events)\n    revenue = calculate_revenue(sales, discounted_prices)\n  \",\n\nIf the discount rate is increased, will the revenue decrease?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the discount rate reduces the prices of items during discount events. Since revenue is calculated from sales and prices, reducing the prices due to a higher discount rate will decrease the revenue, should other factors like sales volume remain constant. This is an example of intervening by changing the discount rate to observe its effect on revenue.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Increasing the discount rate leads to lower discounted prices, which in turn results in decreased revenue."
