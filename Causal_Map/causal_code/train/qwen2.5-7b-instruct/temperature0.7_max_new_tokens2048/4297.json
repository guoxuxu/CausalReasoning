  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, demand_increment, advertising, season):\n    base_demand = 50\n    if season == 'high':\n        seasonal_factor = 1.5\n    else:\n        seasonal_factor = 1.0\n    demand = base_demand + demand_increment * seasonal_factor\n    if advertising > 20:\n        demand *= 1.2\n    sales = demand * price\n    return sales\",\n\nIf the value of 'demand_increment' increases, will the 'sales' value also increase without changing other input parameters?",
  "Explanation": "In the code, 'demand_increment' directly increases the 'demand' when the 'seasonal_factor' and other conditions are constant. Since 'sales' is computed as 'demand' multiplied by 'price', an increase in 'demand' caused by an increase in 'demand_increment' naturally results in higher 'sales'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in demand_increment leads to an increase in sales, provided that advertising does not change and is below or equal to 20. An increase in advertising above 20 also leads to an increase in sales."
