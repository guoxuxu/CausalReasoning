  "Explanation": "The function checks if the 'age' key exists and then evaluates whether the age is 18 or over. Since 25 is greater than 18, 'is_adult' is set to True.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
