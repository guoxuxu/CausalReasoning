  "Explanation": "Even though reversing the transformation (i.e., converting back to the original case and adding any stripped spaces) might provide an approximation, if the string was modified outside basic stripping and lowercasing (like interventions or additional modifications prior to input), the original input can't be fully reconstructed accurately.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
