  "Explanation": "The function is designed to check for the substring 'error' in the input data after it is stripped of leading/trailing spaces and converted to lowercase. If 'error' is found, the function returns 'error'. Thus, if 'process_data' returns 'error', it must have found 'error' in the input, assuming there are no other modifications or errors in the function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
