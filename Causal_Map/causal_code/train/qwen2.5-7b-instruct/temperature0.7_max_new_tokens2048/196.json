  "Explanation": "The total price is a result of the prices of all products and the current discount rate, but adjusting the total price calculation itself (e.g., by directly setting a different total) does not affect the discount rate. Any change in total price seen via the 'getTotalPrice' method does not intrinsically alter the discount rate, as these are calculated values, not causal inputs.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Adjusting the total price does not directly change the discount rate. The discount rate influences the product price and total price through adding or changing products, but changes to the total price do not affect the discount rate directly."
