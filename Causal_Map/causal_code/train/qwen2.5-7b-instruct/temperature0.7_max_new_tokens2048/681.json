  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    if 'temperature' in data:\n        temperature = data['temperature']\n        if temperature > 20:\n            mood = 'happy'\n        else:\n            mood = 'sad'\n    return mood\n\nresponse = process_data({'temperature': 25})\",\n\nIf mood is 'sad', can that definitively tell us that the temperature was 20 degrees or less?",
  "Explanation": "In the code, mood is set to 'sad' only if the temperature is 20 degrees or less. Given that there is no other code path setting mood to 'sad', finding mood set to 'sad' points directly to that temperature condition being met, assuming temperature is present in the data.",
