  "Explanation": "Yes, because in the 'increaseHeat' method, the humidity increase does not directly depend on the current temperature value but rather on the source of heat. Thus, even if the temperature is externally fixed, increasing heat from solar energy directly increases humidity.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "When solar energy increases the temperature, it also increases the humidity. Fixing the temperature externally to 25 degrees bypasses this causal relationship."
