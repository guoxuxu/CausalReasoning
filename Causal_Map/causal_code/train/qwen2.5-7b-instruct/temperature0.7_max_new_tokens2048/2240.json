  "Explanation": "A change in 'average' could be due to several factors apart from changes in 'normalize', such as different input data or modifications in 'remove_outliers'. Without specific interventions indicating changes in 'normalize', we cannot infer a causal relationship from 'average' alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "A change in the input data directly affects the cleaned_data, which in turn affects the normalized_data, and ultimately influences the result dictionary. Specifically, changes in the input data can imply changes in the 'average' value within the result dictionary through the normalization and analysis processes."
