  "Problem": "def process_order(product_id, quantity):\n    stock = check_stock(product_id)\n    if stock >= quantity:\n        update_stock(product_id, quantity)\n        log_activity(product_id, quantity)\n    else:\n        print('Insufficient stock for product', product_id)\",\n\nSuppose increased product orders are placed. Will this lead to more frequent logging of reduced stock?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the rate of orders (intervening by increasing the number of times process_order is called) will likely increase the occurrences of update_stock being called, provided there is sufficient stock, hence more frequent logging in log_activity.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
