  "Problem": "def update_stock(item_purchased, current_stock, purchase_history):\n    # Update the item count in stock\n    if item_purchased in current_stock:\n        current_stock[item_purchased] -= 1\n    # Record the purchase\n    if item_purchased not in purchase_history:\n        purchase_history[item_purchased] = 1\n    else:\n        purchase_history[item_purchased] += 1\n\n    return current_stock, purchase_history\",\n\nIf the purchase history of an item increases, does it indicate that the item was definitely purchased?",
  "Explanation": "The code increments the purchase count in 'purchase_history' for the 'item_purchased' when it is purchased. Therefore, an increase in the purchase history directly indicates that the item was purchased, tracing the effect back to its cause (purchase transaction).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
