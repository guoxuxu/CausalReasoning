  "Problem": "class School { constructor(students, teachers) { this.students = students; this.teachers = teachers; this.performance = this.calculatePerformance(); } calculatePerformance() { return (this.teachers.length > 0) ? this.students.length / this.teachers.length : 0; } increaseTeachers(num) { this.teachers.length += num; this.performance = this.calculatePerformance(); } } let mySchool = new School(400, 20); mySchool.increaseTeachers(5);\",\n\nIf ten additional teachers are hired, will the school's performance index be higher than it was before?",
  "Explanation": "In the code, increasing the number of teachers while keeping the student count the same lowers the performance, since the formula students/teachers results in a smaller number when the denominator (teachers) is increased.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
