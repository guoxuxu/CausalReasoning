  "Problem": "def compute_health_scores(age, diet_quality, exercise_freq): \n    risk_factor = age / 2 + diet_quality * 0.5 - exercise_freq \n    if risk_factor > 20: \n        health_score = 100 - risk_factor \n    else: \n        health_score = 80 + (20 - risk_factor / 2) \n    return health_score\",\n\nIf we improve 'diet_quality', will the 'health_score' increase?",
  "Explanation": "Improving 'diet_quality' decreases the 'risk_factor' as 'diet_quality' negatively influences it (diet_quality * 0.5). The reduction in 'risk_factor' leads to an increase in 'health_score', whether by increasing the subtraction from 100 or by increasing the secondary addition in the else clause. This tests causality by intervening to change 'diet_quality' to see the effect on 'health_score'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
