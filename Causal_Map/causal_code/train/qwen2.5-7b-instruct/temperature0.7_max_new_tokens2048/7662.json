  "Problem": "def compute_health_index(age, smoking_status, exercise_freq, diet_quality):\n    base_health = 100\n    age_penalty = age * 0.5\n    smoke_penalty = 20 if smoking_status else 0\n    exercise_bonus = 10 * exercise_freq\n    diet_bonus = 5 * diet_quality\n    health_index = base_health - age_penalty + exercise_bonus + diet_bonus - smoke_penalty\n    return health_index\",\n\nIf the health index is observed to decrease, can we infer that age has increased?",
  "Explanation": "A decrease in the health index could be influenced by several variables besides just an increase in age, such as an increase in smoking status, a decrease in exercise frequency, or a decline in diet quality. Without observing the other variables, a decrease in health index does not necessarily imply an increase in age.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
