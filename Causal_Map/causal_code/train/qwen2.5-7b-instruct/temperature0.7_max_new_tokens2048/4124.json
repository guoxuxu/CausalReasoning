  "Explanation": "Yes, because the risk factor calculation still includes the age multiplied by 1.2 for a 'good' health status. So, manipulating the health status to 'good' and changing the age will still affect the risk factor, though the influence might be reduced compared to if the health status were 'poor'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "age directly influences risk_factor, and health_status directly influences risk_factor. Therefore, even if health_status is changed to 'good', a change in age will still affect the risk_factor."
