  "Problem": "class Employee { constructor(name, isManager) { this.name = name; this.isManager = isManager; this.salary = isManager ? 5000 : 3000; } updateSalary(increment) { if (this.isManager) { this.salary += increment * 1.2; } else { this.salary += increment; } } reportIssue() { if (!this.isManager) { return 'issue reported'; } else { return 'resolve issue directly'; } } }\",\n\nIf an employee receives an increment, will this change the salary differently based on whether they are a manager?",
  "Explanation": "According to the `updateSalary` method, managers and non-managers receive different increment calculations for their salary increases. Managers have their increments multiplied by 1.2, indicating a higher final increment compared to non-managers who receive the increment as is.",
