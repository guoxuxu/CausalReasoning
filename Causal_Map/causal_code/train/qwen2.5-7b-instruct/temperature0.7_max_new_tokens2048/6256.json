  "Problem": "def vaccination_effect(population, vaccinated_percentage, mask_policy): \n    if mask_policy: \n        transmission_rate = 0.05 \n    else: \n        transmission_rate = 0.15 \n\n    vaccinated_population = int(population * vaccinated_percentage / 100) \n    unvaccinated_population = population - vaccinated_population \n\n    vaccinated_infected = vaccinated_population * (transmission_rate / 2) \n    unvaccinated_infected = unvaccinated_population * transmission_rate \n\n    total_infected = vaccinated_infected + unvaccinated_infected \n    return total_infected\",\n\nIf we observe an increase in total_infected, does this imply a reduction in vaccinated_percentage if the mask_policy remains unchanged?",
  "Explanation": "An increase in total_infected under a constant mask_policy could be caused by a higher number of unvaccinated individuals, suggesting a decrease in vaccinated_percentage.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
