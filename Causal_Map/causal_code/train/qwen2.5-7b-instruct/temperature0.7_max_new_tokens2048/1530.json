  "Explanation": "Knowing that 'apply_filter' outputs zeros implies some values are below the threshold after normalization. One could alter the 'normalize' method to scale the data differently (e.g., higher scaling factor) or adjust the data prior to normalization to shift all values upwards, ensuring all normalized values surpass the threshold, thus eliminating zeros in 'processed_data'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The maximum value of the data (max_val) directly influences both the normalization process and the final processed data (processed_data). The threshold value directly influences which elements of the normalized data become zero in the processed data."
