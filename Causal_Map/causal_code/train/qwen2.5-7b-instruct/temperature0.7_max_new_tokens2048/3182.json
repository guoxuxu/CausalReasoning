  "Explanation": "Decreasing product inventory alone (e.g., products expiring or getting lost) does not necessarily increase sales. Sales increase is strictly tied to actual transaction quantities, not just inventory reduction.",

  "causal_map_integration": "Decreasing product inventory can increase sales but only if the price is adjusted, as lowering inventory below 10 triggers a price reduction which then boosts sales."
