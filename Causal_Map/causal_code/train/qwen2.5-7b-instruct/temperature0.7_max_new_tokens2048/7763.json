  "Explanation": "Setting humidity to 85 affects the calculation in feels_like(). Given that the humidity is now always above 80, the temperature will always be adjusted by multiplying 1.04, regardless of what the initial temperature was, thereby always modifying the computed 'feels like' temperature.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
