  "Explanation": "The length of final_result depends on how many elements in data_list remain positive after the processing. Since the values in data_list could be negative or positive, and the transformations applied (multiplying by scale and adding offset) can change their positivity, the final count does not necessarily correlate directly with the original count of elements in data_list.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
