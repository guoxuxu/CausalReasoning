  "Explanation": "Resetting the 'orange' count to 10 is an intervention, but since 'orange' is not sold (its initial count in sold_items is zero), this intervention does not change the behavior of decrement operation in 'update_inventory'. The code decrements the count only if an item appears in sold_items and already has a nonzero count in the inventory.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Resetting the inventory count of 'orange' to 10 (reset_inventory_count) will change the updated inventory (updated_inventory), specifically preventing the decrement of 'orange' (updated_orange_count) since it will be set back to 10 before any decrements occur."
