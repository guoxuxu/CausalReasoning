  "Explanation": "The heartDisease() method checks if the person is a smoker and over 50 or if their cholesterol level is over 200. Both conditions are met here, therefore it returns true.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
