  "Explanation": "Even though the sales dictionary might have an entry for oranges, it's possible that the sale could not be fulfilled due to lack of sufficient stock or oranges not being part of the product list amended prior to the function call. Thus, unchanged inventory does not necessarily mean there were no sales attempts.",
