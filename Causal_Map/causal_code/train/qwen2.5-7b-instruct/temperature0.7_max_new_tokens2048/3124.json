  "Explanation": "Setting 'expenses' to zero will definitely increase the 'profit'. However, whether the performance becomes 'good' depends on the sum of 'sales' being greater than 1000. Without knowing the sales figures, we can’t guarantee a 'good' performance.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
