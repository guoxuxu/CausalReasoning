  "Explanation": "When 'result' is exactly 15, it means no additional points were added from the 'pressure' condition, thus confirming that the pressure was not manipulated to be above 120. If it were, the result would increase by 5, making the total greater than 15.",

If the result is exactly 15, it does not confirm that no pressure manipulation was done above 120, as the initial temp_adjust could have been such that only the additional 5 was added."
