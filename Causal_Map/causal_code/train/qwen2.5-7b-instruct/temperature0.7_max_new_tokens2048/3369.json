  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator {\n    private boolean isRainy;\n    private boolean isWeekend;\n\n    public WeatherSimulator() {\n        this.isRainy = Math.random() < 0.4;\n        this.isWeekend = Math.random() < 0.3;\n    }\n\n    public boolean decideToGoOut() {\n        return isWeekend && !isRainy;\n    }\n\n    public boolean adjustRainProbability(double intervention) {\n        isRainy = Math.random() < intervention;\n        return isRainy;\n    }\n\n    public boolean isItWeekend() {\n        return isWeekend;\n    }\n}\n\",\n\nIf we observe that the simulator did not decide to go out after intervention that set rain probability to 0%, can we conclude it was not the weekend?",
  "Explanation": "After such an intervention, the only remaining factor that affects the decision to go out is whether it is the weekend. Since it was intervened that it's not raining and the simulator still does not go out, it indicates that it is not the weekend.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The decision to go out depends on both whether it is rainy and whether it is the weekend. Adjusting the rain probability influences whether it is rainy. Whether it is the weekend determines if it is considered a weekend."
