  "Explanation": "Unchanged post_increase_prices do not necessarily mean that prices were not increased. It's possible that an increase in prices was exactly offset by an adjustment (possibly an increase) in the discount rates, yielding the same final prices. Without specific knowledge of interventions on discount rates alongside or knowledge about the extent of price increases, one cannot infer whether the 'increase_prices' method was executed based solely on unchanged post_increase_prices.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
