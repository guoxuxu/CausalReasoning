  "Explanation": "Charging the battery (intervention) directly affects the `batteryLevel`. When `batteryLevel` is set above 20, `isFunctional` is set to true. Thus, this intervention on the cause (battery charge) directly ensures the effect (robot functionality).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Charging the battery to a level above 20 may make the robot functional, but it does not guarantee it will remain functional without further conditions. The robot's functionality depends on its battery level staying above 20 after usage."
