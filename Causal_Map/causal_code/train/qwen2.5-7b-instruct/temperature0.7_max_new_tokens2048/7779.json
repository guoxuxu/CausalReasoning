  "Problem": "The above Python code block\",\n\nIf officials could prevent car breakdowns, would this reduce the total travel time?",
  "Explanation": "Car breakdowns add an additional 60 minutes to the travel time as per the given code. Preventing breakdowns would remove this additional time, thereby reducing the total travel time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Officials preventing car breakdowns → Reduced car breakdowns; Reduced car breakdowns → Lower travel disruptions; Lower travel disruptions → Reduced total travel time",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "If officials prevent car breakdowns, it will lead to reduced car breakdowns, which in turn will lower travel disruptions, ultimately reducing the total travel time."
