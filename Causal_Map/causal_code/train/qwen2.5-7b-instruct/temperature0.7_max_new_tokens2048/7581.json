  "Explanation": "In the given function, there is a direct check for the age being greater than 50. If true, the code deducts 10 points from the base score. Therefore, increasing the age beyond 50 will directly decrease the health score.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
