  "Explanation": "The age_squared variable is directly calculated as the square of age. Hence, without any interventions, increasing age will naturally lead to an increase in age_squared.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
