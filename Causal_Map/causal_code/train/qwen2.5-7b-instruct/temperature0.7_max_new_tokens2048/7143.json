  "Explanation": "From cause to effect with intervention: By setting default non-None values for minimum and maximum in the analyze_data function when input_data is empty (e.g., default minimum and maximum to 0), we ensure that 'range' can still be calculated and thus it will always be present in the summary dictionary.",
