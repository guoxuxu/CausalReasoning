  "Explanation": "Optionally setting the 'discount_code' to 'SUMMER20' doesn't necessarily imply the customer had a coupon, as code assignments can be manually manipulated or affected by external logic not reflected in the observable 'has_coupon' value. Hence, we cannot reliably backtrack from the discount application to the possession of a real coupon.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of `has_coupon` determines the `discount_code`, which in turn affects the `final_price`. If `discount_code` is manually set to 'SUMMER20', it implies that `has_coupon` was true, but we cannot definitively determine if the customer actually had a coupon without additional context."
