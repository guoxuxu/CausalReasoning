  "Explanation": "Removing humidifiers and reducing humidity would potentially drop the humidity below the requirement (>80) for 'Rainy'. This could change the weather forecast result potentially to 'Cloudy' or 'Sunny', depending on how the temperature variable is affected or maintained.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
