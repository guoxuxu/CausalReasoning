  "Explanation": "Stopping the storm and observing no rain does not reliably indicate that the temperature is above 20 degrees Celsius because the rain condition in 'willItRain' depends on both the storminess and the temperature being below 20. Without the storm, the lack of rain doesn't necessarily mean that the temperature wasn’t low enough.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The presence of a storm directly causes the forecast to predict rain. A temperature below 20 degrees directly causes the forecast to predict rain. Stopping the storm prevents rain, but only if the temperature is also low enough for rain to occur."
