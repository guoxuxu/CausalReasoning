  "Explanation": "While applying a 'Discount' could result in a lower total shown, the total could also decrease due to other reasons such as removing items. Therefore, a decrease in the 'total' doesn't definitively imply that a discount was applied, predominantly because of the potential intervention by removals.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
