  "Problem": "{\n    \"code\": \"class Initializer { int counter; Initializer() { counter = 0; } void increment() { counter += 1; } boolean isEven() { return counter % 2 == 0; } } Initializer init = new Initializer(); init.increment(); boolean result = init.isEven();\"\n  },\n\nIf we modify the increment method to add 2 instead of 1, then call `increment()` once, will `isEven()` return true?",
  "Explanation": "The modification of the `increment()` method to add 2 instead of 1 means that after one call, `counter` will be 2. The `isEven()` method checks if `counter % 2 == 0`, and since 2 % 2 is 0, it will return true.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
