  "Problem": "Snippet provided above\",\n\nWill increasing the quantity in 'add_inventory' directly affect the return value of 'sell_item' for the same item?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the inventory of an item directly increases the stock available, thereby making it more likely that there will be enough stock to meet a sell request, which in turn affects whether 'sell_item' can successfully complete a transaction (return True) or not.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "add_inventory → sell_item;",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Increasing the quantity in 'add_inventory' may indirectly affect the return value of 'sell_item' for the same item by potentially making more items available for sale, which could influence selling prices or quantities sold."
