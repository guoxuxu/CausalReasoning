  "Explanation": "Setting marketing campaigns to high priority is based on the condition that conversions are already equal to or exceed the priority threshold. The priority setting itself does not influence the number of conversions; it is a response to conversion numbers and does not causally increase them.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
