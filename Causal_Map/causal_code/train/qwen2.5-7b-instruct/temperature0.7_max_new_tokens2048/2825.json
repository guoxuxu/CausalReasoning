  "Explanation": "While setting the cloud cover to 'high' can increase the rain probability to 75, other factors such as changing humidity directly could also affect the probability. The increase to 75 might be due to direct adjustments in humidity or combined settings in cloud cover and humidity, and not solely because of cloud cover intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If the temperature is less than 20 and the humidity is greater than 50, then the cloud cover will be high, which increases the rain probability to 75; alternatively, if the humidity is greater than 80, the rain probability will be 50."
