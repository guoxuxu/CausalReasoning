  "Explanation": "Setting 'profit' to a positive value directly affects 'growth_rate', as per the conditional check in the code that sets 'growth_rate' to 0.1 if 'profit' is positive.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
