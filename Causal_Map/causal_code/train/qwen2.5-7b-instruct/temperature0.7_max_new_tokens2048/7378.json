  "Explanation": "A 'low' tax_bracket implies that either the person is not an adult or the person's income is ≤ 50000. If the individual's age is less than 18 (not an adult), the tax_bracket can be 'low' regardless of the actual amount of income. Thus, a 'low' tax bracket does not necessarily mean a low income.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If data['income'] is less than 50000 and data['is_adult'] is true, then data['tax_bracket'] is set to 'low'. Therefore, having a tax_bracket of 'low' does not necessarily mean the person had a low income, as it could also be due to being a non-adult with income up to 50000."
