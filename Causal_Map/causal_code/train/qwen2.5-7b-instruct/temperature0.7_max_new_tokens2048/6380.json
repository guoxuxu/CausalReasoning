  "Problem": "def complex_computation(x): \n    y = x * 2 \n    z = y + 3 \n    if z > 10: \n        result = z - 5 \n    else: \n        result = z + 5 \n    return result\",\n\nSeeing an increase in the value of result, can we conclude that x has increased?",
  "Explanation": "An increase in result could be due to two reasons: either x has increased, which naturally increases y and then z, or changes in the condition (z node crossing the threshold of 10). If initially z was just below 10 and due to an increase in x, z just crosses 10, the formula for result transitions from z + 5 to z - 5, potentially reducing or minimally changing the result despite an increase in x.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
