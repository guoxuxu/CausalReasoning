  "Explanation": "From effect to cause without intervention: 'z' can also increase if 'y' increases, without any change in 'x'. Additionally, 'z' relies not only on 'x' but also on whether 'x' is positive or negative since that affects the formula used to calculate 'z'.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
