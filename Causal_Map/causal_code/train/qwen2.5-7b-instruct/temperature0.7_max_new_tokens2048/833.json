  "Problem": "class Experiment { int temp; double reactionRate; void increaseTemp() { temp += 5; if (temp > 100) reactionRate *= 2; else reactionRate += 10; } void decreaseReaction() { if (reactionRate > 20) { reactionRate -= 5; temp -= 3; } } }\",\n\nIf the reaction rate has doubled, can we conclude that the temperature went above 100?",
  "Explanation": "Although the temperature exceeding 100 results in the reaction rate doubling, the reaction rate might also increase by other operations or external modifications not shown in the provided code. We don't have evidence that other parts of the program or external factors do not affect the reaction rate, hence we cannot definitively conclude the cause solely based on the effect.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
