  "Explanation": "With an intervention through the updateValues function explicitly setting a and b, the output of the multiply method will be 50, which will be greater than before unless both a and b were already greater than or equal to 10 and 5 respectively. This showcases a causal relationship from cause to effect with intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
