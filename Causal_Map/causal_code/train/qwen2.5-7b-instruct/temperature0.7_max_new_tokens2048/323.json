  "Explanation": "Adding a 'multiply' operation after 'add(5)' would change the intermediate state from 15 to 30 (15 * 2), and following 'subtract(3)', the final output would then be 27 instead of 12. Therefore, intervening by adding a multiplication operation significantly affects the outcome due to the compound effect on the subsequent subtraction.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
