  "Explanation": "The final price can be reduced either by coupon usage or by the total price exceeding $100, which grants an additional discount. Thus, a reduced final price does not unequivocally verify the application of a 'SAVE10' coupon.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If the coupon is 'SAVE10', the discount is set to 0.1; if the total price exceeds 100, an additional 5% discount is applied; the final price is calculated by reducing the total price by the accumulated discount."
