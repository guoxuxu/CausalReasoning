  "Explanation": "A higher feedback score can result from a low system load, which isn't necessarily due to a recent update. The update does increase the score by a constant factor, but other factors like lower system load due to fewer users can also increase the score independently.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
