  "Problem": "def update_inventory(sales, returns): \n    current_stock = 100 \n    for sale_quantity in sales: \n        current_stock -= sale_quantity \n    for return_quantity in returns: \n        current_stock += return_quantity \n    return current_stock\",\n\nIf we manually reduce each sale in the 'sales' list by 10 items, will this result in a higher 'current_stock' at the end of the function?",
  "Explanation": "Reducing each sale quantity results in less stock being deducted per sale, which causes the final 'current_stock' to be higher after all sales and returns have been processed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Decreasing each sale_quantity by 10 items will result in a higher current_stock because fewer items will be subtracted from the stock during each sale iteration."
