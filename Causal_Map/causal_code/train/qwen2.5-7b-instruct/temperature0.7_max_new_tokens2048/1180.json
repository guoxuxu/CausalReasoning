  "Problem": "def calculate_health_effects(smoking, age, exercise, diet):\n    health_score = 100\n    if smoking:\n        health_score -= 30\n    if age > 50:\n        health_score -= 20\n    if exercise:\n        health_score += 20\n    if diet == 'healthy':\n        health_score += 10\n    return health_score\",\n\nIf an individual stops smoking, will the health score increase?",
  "Explanation": "Stopping smoking directly removes the condition that reduces the health score by 30 points in the code, therefore, if an individual stops smoking, their health score will naturally increase.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
