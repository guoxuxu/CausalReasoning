  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, demand, advertisement_expense, season):\n    if season == 'high':\n        season_factor = 1.2\n    else:\n        season_factor = 0.8\n    base_sales = price * demand * season_factor\n    if advertisement_expense > 1000:\n        return base_sales * 1.1\n    else:\n        return base_sales\",\n\nIf we can control advertisement expenses over 1000, does it guarantee an increase in sales?",
  "Explanation": "The code directly multiplies the base sales by 1.1 if the advertisement expenses are over 1000, thereby mathematically guaranteeing an increase in sales from the original base sales calculation. Here, with intervention in advertisement expenses, we can ascertain a definite increase in sales when advertisement exceeds 1000.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Increasing advertisement expenses above 1000 guarantees a 10% increase in sales, while price, demand, and season affect sales through their respective factors."
