  "Explanation": "Profit is directly influenced by both total_sales and expenses, as expressed by the equation profit = total_sales * 0.2 - expenses. If expenses are modified through an intervention while keeping total_sales the same, the profit would change accordingly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Manipulating expenses directly affects profit. Total sales and total views indirectly influence profit through their effects on sales boost, which is then used to calculate profit. Holidays also indirectly affect profit by influencing sales boost."
