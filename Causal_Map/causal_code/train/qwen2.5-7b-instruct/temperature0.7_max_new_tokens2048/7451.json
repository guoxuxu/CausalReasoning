  "Explanation": "Fixing the 'tax_rate' to zero simplifies the calculation of 'taxed_price' to just 'base_price'. An increase in 'demand_factor' increases 'base_price', and because the tax effects are neutralized, the increase more directly influences the 'final_price', even after subtracting the 'discount'.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in demand_factor will affect final_price through its impact on base_price, which then influences final_price. Setting tax_rate to zero removes its effect on taxed_price and final_price."
