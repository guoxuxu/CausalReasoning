  "Problem": "def process_order(amount, discount_code, loyalty_status):\n    discount = 0\n    if discount_code == 'SUMMER20':\n        discount = 0.2\n    elif discount_code == 'VIPCLIENT':\n        discount = 0.25 if loyalty_status == 'Gold' else 0.15\n\n    total = amount - (amount * discount)\n    return total\",\n\nIf we set the discount_code to 'VIPCLIENT' and force the loyalty_status to 'Gold', will this decrease the total more significantly than if the loyalty_status is not 'Gold'?",
  "Explanation": "Setting the loyalty_status to 'Gold' while using 'VIPCLIENT' raises the discount to 0.25 (from 0.15), which significantly reduces the total compared to loyalty statuses below 'Gold'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Setting the discount_code to 'VIPCLIENT' and forcing the loyalty_status to 'Gold' will result in a higher discount compared to when loyalty_status is not 'Gold', which in turn will decrease the total more significantly."
