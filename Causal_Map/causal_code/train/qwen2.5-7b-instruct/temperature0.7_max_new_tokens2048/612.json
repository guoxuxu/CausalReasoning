  "Explanation": "While significant reductions in final_prices suggest a possible increase in the loyalty score above the 5 point threshold, it's not a certain conclusion. Without direct intervention or additional data on the loyalty_score, we cannot rule out other factors, such as potentially lower original prices or external code changes affecting discount computation. Direct manipulation or additional context about the loyalty_score is required for certainty.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "loyalty_score > 5 → discount_rate = 0.15; discount_rate = 0.15 → discounted_prices are significantly reduced; loyalty_score ≤ 5 → discount_rate = 0.05; discount_rate = 0.05 → discounted_prices are less reduced",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "If the loyalty_score exceeds 5, then the discount_rate is set to 15%, which leads to significantly reduced discounted_prices. Conversely, if the loyalty_score does not exceed 5, the discount_rate is set to 5%, resulting in less reduced discounted_prices."
