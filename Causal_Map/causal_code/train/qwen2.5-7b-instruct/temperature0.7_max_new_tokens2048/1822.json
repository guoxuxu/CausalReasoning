  "Explanation": "The checkUmbrellaNeed method bases the need for an umbrella on both rain and temperature being 20 degrees or less. However, needing an umbrella does not confirm the exact temperature unless it's also verified that it is raining—there remains a possibility of temperature being above 20 but still requiring an umbrella due to rain.",
