  "Explanation": "By removing the conditional subtraction from the functionality, the output 'result' becomes solely dependent on the scaled 'warmed_data' value. Since this value is calculated as 0.5 * data * (1.2 + data), which is a monotonically increasing function (all coefficients are positive and increasing with data), increasing 'data_input' directly leads to an increase in 'result'. Thus, making this intervention simplifies the relation and ensures an increase in output with an increase in input.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Increasing 'data' directly causes an increase in 'warmed_data', which in turn directly causes an increase in 'result' when 'data' is greater than 20. Otherwise, increasing 'data' leads to an increase in 'warmed_data', followed by a decrease in 'result' by 10."
