  "Explanation": "For `qualityCheckPassed` to be true, both `hasEngine` and `hasTransmission` need to be true. This condition can only be satisfied if both `installEngine` and `installTransmission` methods have been successfully called, since these are the only methods that set `hasEngine` and `hasTransmission` respectively.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
