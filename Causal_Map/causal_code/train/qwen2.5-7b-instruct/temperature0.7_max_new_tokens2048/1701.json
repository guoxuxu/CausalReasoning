  "Explanation": "By reducing the number of questions to fewer than 5, students are not subjected to the incremental increase in stress specified in the quiz_given function. As a result, stress levels are likely to be lower unless externally influenced by other factors, thus reducing instances where teachers would observe students needing support due to high stress.",
