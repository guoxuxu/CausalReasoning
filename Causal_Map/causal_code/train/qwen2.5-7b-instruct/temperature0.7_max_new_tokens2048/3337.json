  "Explanation": "Directly setting the speed to 20 via an external intervention does not confirm that the start_engine method was called. The engine could still be off while the speed displays a non-zero value due to the external manipulation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
