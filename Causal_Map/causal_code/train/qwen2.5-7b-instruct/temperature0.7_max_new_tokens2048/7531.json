  "Problem": "public class WeatherSystem { int humidity = 70; int getTemperature() { if (humidity > 65) { return 25; } else { return 30; } } void setHumidity(int newHumidity) { humidity = newHumidity; } boolean isRainy() { return humidity > 80; } }\",\n\nIf a dehumidifier is used causing a massive reduction in humidity, will this affect the likelihood of it being rainy?",
  "Explanation": "The isRainy() method checks if humidity is over 80 for rain. Using a dehumidifier to reduce humidity would directly decrease the probability of it being classified as rainy, affecting the output of isRainy().",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Reducing humidity may decrease the likelihood of it being rainy because lower humidity is less likely to meet the threshold for rain."
