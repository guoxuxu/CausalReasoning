  "Problem": "public class WeatherSystem {\n  private boolean isRaining;\n  private int temperature;\n  public WeatherSystem(boolean rain, int temp) {\n    isRaining = rain;\n    temperature = temp;\n  }\n  public void adjustWeather() {\n    if (temperature > 30) {\n      isRaining = false;\n    } else if (temperature < 20) {\n      isRaining = true;\n    }\n  }\n  public boolean willItRain() {\n    return isRaining;\n  }\n  public void increaseTemperature(int increment) {\n    temperature += increment;\n    adjustWeather();\n  }\n  public String getWeatherStatus() {\n    if (isRaining) {\n      return \"Rainy\";\n    } else {\n      return \"Sunny\";\n    }\n  }\n}\",\n\nIf the temperature is increased by 20 degrees from 15 degrees, will the system end up predicting sunny weather?",
  "Explanation": "If the temperature is initially 15 degrees and is increased by 20 degrees, it results in a temperature of 35 degrees. According to adjustWeather, if the temperature exceeds 30 degrees, isRaining is set to false, thus predicting sunny weather.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
