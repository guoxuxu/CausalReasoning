  "Explanation": "Setting isCloudy to true alone does not guarantee rain, as the temperature also needs to be below 20 degrees Celsius. Without knowing the initial temperature or that it is less than 20, it cannot be concluded that willItRain() will surely return true based on isCloudy being true alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
