  "Explanation": "This is a more complex scenario as several factors could modify 'overtime' data — such as changes in the overtime policy condition threshold — without altering input data like 'hours_worked'. Thus, a change in 'overtime' data doesn't necessarily mean 'hours_worked' had changed; it's not a straightforward reverse causal inference with intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
