  "Explanation": "An increase in the returned value could be due to an increase in the overall values in the data list (including through interventions like adding 5 to each element) or simply because more high-value elements were included or because the quantity of data crossed the 50-element threshold. It doesn't directly infer that each element was increased uniformly by 5.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If the length of the data list is greater than 50, then the adjusted mean is increased by 5. The mean value is calculated as the sum of the data divided by its length, which is then multiplied by 1.05 to get the adjusted mean."
