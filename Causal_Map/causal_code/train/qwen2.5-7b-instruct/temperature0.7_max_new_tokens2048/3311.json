  "Explanation": "No, a high growth rate might result from either sunny weather or the application of fertilizer, or both. Thus, high growth doesn't necessarily mean it was sunny, as fertilizer can also independently impact growth.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
