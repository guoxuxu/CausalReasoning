  "Explanation": "The only pathway to obtain a 'processed' status in the response is via the condition in handle_request that checks if 'authenticated' is True. This supports tracing back from effect (processed status) to cause ('authenticated' being True) without intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If 'authenticated' was initially set to True, then the final response status is 'processed'. The authenticated status directly influences whether the request is processed or considered unauthorized. If processed, user_data is modified by process_data, which increments the age."
