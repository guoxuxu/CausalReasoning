  "Explanation": "While a high 'marketing_spend' contributes to higher 'next_year_sales' via the 'marketing_effect', other factors such as 'base_sales' and 'market_growth' also play significant roles in determining 'next_year_sales'. Without controlling for these variables, it cannot be definitively concluded that the observed increase in 'next_year_sales' was stimulated solely by the increase in 'marketing_spend'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in marketing spend leads to a higher marketing effect, which in turn increases next year's sales. Additionally, market growth influences the growth factor, which also contributes to the increase in next year's sales."
