  "Explanation": "Suppose we intervene and discover a specific discounted price of 85. Given the original discount of 15%, this would reverse calculate to a base price of exactly 100 before discount (since 85 is 85% of 100). To have the base price at exactly 100 despite the existence of a random_increase function, we must have intervened to set the random increase to zero, eliminating its effect.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The random increase in base price, followed by a 15% discount, determines the discounted price. Setting the discounted price to exactly 85 does not necessarily suggest that the random increase was reset to zero, as other factors could also affect the price."
