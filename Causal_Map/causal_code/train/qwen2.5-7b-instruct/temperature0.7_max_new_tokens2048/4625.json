  "Explanation": "While the causal logic in `updateDelay` would usually suggest a traffic level between 50 and 79 for a 'Moderate' delay, manually setting the delay does not affect or reflect the actual traffic level in the system as the traffic level and delay updating mechanisms are independent in terms of direct assignments.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The traffic level directly influences the delay, and updating the traffic level triggers an update to the delay. However, setting the delay to 'Moderate' does not directly imply a specific traffic level range; it is the traffic level that determines the delay state."
