  "Explanation": "In this coding scenario, a decrease in sales could either result from the price being increased above 100, or not enough from an external influence not represented within this code. We cannot definitively attribute a drop in sales solely to a price increase without ruling out other possible factors.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
