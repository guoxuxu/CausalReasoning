  "Explanation": "Directly from the code, the pressure is calculated based on the temperature (`this.pressure = (int) (temperature * 1.2)` initially, and `this.pressure = (int) (temperature * 1.1)` after intervention). In both cases, an increase in temperature directly causes an increase in pressure.",
