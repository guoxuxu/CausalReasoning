  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t} \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are real numbers. We are examining the effects of applying a Laplace transformation \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{z(t)\\} \\) which maps \\( z(t) \\) into the s-domain.\n\nIf \\( z(t) \\) evolves freely without any external intervention, does the Laplace transformation \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{z(t)\\} = \\frac{1}{s-(a+bi)} \\) represent the transformed function in the s-domain correctly for all \\( s \\) not equal to \\( a+bi \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transformation of \\( z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t} \\) correctly maps into \\( \\frac{1}{s-(a+bi)} \\) in the s-domain under standard conditions. The formula used correctly accounts for the exponential growth or decay as modified by the complex exponential factor.",

List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
