  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the wave equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is the wave speed. Investigate the effect of introducing a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) = u_0(x) \\\\).\n\nCan we reconstruct the original \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) from \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) accurately at T > 0 without knowing if a Fourier transformation was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the initial Fourier transform, reconstructing the exact initial condition \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) from the evolved state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) is not possible, as the transformation may have altered essential phase or amplitude information of modes.",
