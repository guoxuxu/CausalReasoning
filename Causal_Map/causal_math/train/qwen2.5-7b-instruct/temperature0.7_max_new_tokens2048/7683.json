  "Problem": "Let's consider two complex functions \\( f(z) = e^z \\) and \\( g(z) = \\sin(z) \\) applied to a complex variable \\( z \\). The behavior of these functions under the Laplace transform is studied, where the transformation is denoted \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f\\} \\) and applied as an intervention.\n\nIf, at time \\( t_1 \\), another function \\( g(z) = \\sin(z) \\) is introduced as an intervention affecting the state \\( z(t_1) \\), will the final state \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) still be predicted accurately using only the initial function \\( f \\) and its Laplace transform?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\( \\sin(z) \\) as an intervention modifies the previously computed trajectory under \\( f(z) = e^z \\). The new behavior induced by \\( g(z) \\) modifies the properties of the state due to non-linear transformations involved, leading to a final state \\( z(T) \\) that cannot be solely predicted by the initial conditions and \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f\\} \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The introduction of g(z) at time t1 influences z(t1), which then affects the final state z(T) for T > t1. Therefore, the final state z(T) cannot be accurately predicted solely based on the initial function f(z) and its Laplace transform without considering the impact of g(z)."
