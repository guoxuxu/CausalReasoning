  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\), with \\( M \\) being a complex matrix. Investigate how the Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} = Z(s) \\), affects the dynamics of \\( z(t) \\), where \\( s \\) is the complex frequency variable.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\( M \\) to \\( M' \\) at time \\( t_1 \\), and the Laplace Transform is reapplied, will the system's behavior at time \\( t = T \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) be influenced by the original matrix \\( M \\) or just \\( M' \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The behavior of \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) will reflect the influence of both \\( M \\) and \\( M' \\). The initial segment evolves under \\( M \\) until \\( t_1 \\), and subsequent evolution follows \\( M' \\). Thus, both matrices collectively determine the state at \\( T \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The matrix M determines the dynamics of z(t) through the differential equation dz/dt = Mz up to time t1, while M' influences z(t) from t1 onwards via dz'/dt = M'z. The Laplace transform Z(s) represents z(t) before t1, and Z'(s) represents z(t) after t1. Thus, the system's behavior at t = T (for T > t1) is influenced solely by M' after t1."
