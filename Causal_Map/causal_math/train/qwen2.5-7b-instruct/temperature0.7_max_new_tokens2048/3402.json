  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that satisfies the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), with D being a diffusion coefficient. Analyze the influence of applying a Fourier transform to the function at initial time t = 0, namely \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, 0) = \\\\mathcal{F}[u(x, 0)](k) \\\\).\n\nAfter observing the function \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) at time T (post-evolution), can we accurately retrieve the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) without knowing whether the Fourier transformation was applied beforehand?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Fourier transform is invertible and the evolution is deterministically governed by the given PDE, one can work backward from \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) using the inverse Fourier transform and the known evolution law to precisely recover \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "D → ∂²u/∂x²; u(x, 0) → hat{u}(k, 0); hat{u}(k, 0) → hat{u}(k, T); Fourier transform → hat{u}(k, 0)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The diffusion coefficient D influences the second spatial derivative of u(x, t). The initial condition u(x, 0) determines the Fourier transform at initial time \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, 0) \\\\), which evolves over time to become \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\). Applying the Fourier transform to u(x, 0) results in \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, 0) \\\\)."
