  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Mx\\\\), where M is a skew-symmetric matrix. Analyze the effect of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Nt}x \\\\) over time t, where N is another skew-symmetric matrix.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), is it possible to determine precisely what interventions were applied (whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\), \\\\( j(x) \\\\), or both), solely based on the final state value \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions like \\\\( h(x) \\\\) and \\\\( j(x) \\\\) from the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) alone presents a high degree of ambiguity. The non-commutative nature of skew-symmetric matrix exponentials can lead to overlapping effects, potentially resulting in indistinguishable end-states from different combinations of interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation defined by \\( h(x) = e^{Nt}x \\) and the final state \\( x(T) \\) have a causal relationship such that applying \\( h(x) \\) at time \\( t \\) results in the state \\( x(T) \\). Similarly, if \\( j(x) \\) were applied, it would also result in \\( x(T) \\), making it impossible to determine precisely which transformation was applied based solely on the final state value."
