  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) where \\\\( z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\omega s} ds \\\\). Here, \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant real number.\n\nDoes increasing \\\\( \\omega \\\\) lead to a decrease in the magnitude of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a fixed time \\\\( t \\\\), without any external intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The integral \\\\( z(t) \\\\) represents the area under the curve of the complex exponential. Increasing \\\\( \\omega \\\\) increases the frequency of oscillations within the interval [0, t], which leads to more cancellations in the integral of the sine and cosine components, effectively reducing the magnitude of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Increasing ω leads to changes in z(t), which in turn affects the magnitude of z(t)."
