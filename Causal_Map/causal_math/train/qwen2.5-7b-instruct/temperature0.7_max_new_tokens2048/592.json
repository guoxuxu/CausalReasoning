  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), leading to a transformed function \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - iw} \\\\).\n\nKnowing only the final transformed function \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i(w+u)} \\\\), can we determine specifically whether any interventions were applied and what those exact interventions were?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) only reveals the combined effect of frequency modifications; it does not specify whether it remains the original or includes additional influences such as \\\\( u \\\\). Therefore, the specific intervention cannot be uniquely identified.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
