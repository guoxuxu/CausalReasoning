  "Problem": "Consider a linear algebraic scenario where a random initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in \\\\( \\\\mathbb{R}^n \\\\) undergoes a transformation by matrix \\\\( M \\\\) and then evolves under a linear transformation governed by matrix \\\\( L \\\\), leading to \\\\( z_t = L^t M z_0 \\\\) over discrete time steps \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nDoes the initial application of the matrix \\\\( M \\\\) influence the state \\\\( z_T \\\\) at any future time \\\\( T \\\\) in the case where only \\\\( L \\\\) governs the evolution thereafter?",
  "Explanation": "Since the initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is modified by matrix \\\\( M \\\\) before any evolution takes place, the future states at any time \\\\( T \\\\) are influenced by \\\\( M \\\\). The matrix \\\\( M \\\\) effectively sets the initial state which is then evolved by repeated applications of \\\\( L \\\\), resulting in a state \\\\( z_T \\\\) that is dependent on both \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( L \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial application of matrix M on vector z_0 (M → z_0) directly influences the state z_T at any future time T through the intermediate state z_0 (z_0 → z_T), since z_T = L^T M z_0."
