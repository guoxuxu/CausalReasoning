  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) that satisfies the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( k > 0 \\\\) is a constant. Analyses include transforming the function via \\\\( g(u) = e^{\\\\lambda t}u \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant.\n\nObserving the state of \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) at time T, can we conclusively determine the initial state \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) without knowing if the transformation \\\\( g(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the initial state was transformed by \\\\( g(u) = e^{\\\\lambda t}u \\\\), the original state \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined from the state at time T. The presence of the transformation introduces uncertainty in reconstructing the initial conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state u(x,0) influences the state u(x,t) at any later time t through the heat equation. Applying the transformation g(u) affects the state u(x,t), but knowing u(x,t) at time T alone is insufficient to determine u(x,0) without information about g(u) or its inverse."
