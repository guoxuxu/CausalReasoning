  "Problem": "Evaluate the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) under the influence of Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing components of the complex signal over time t.\n\nIf the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t)) \\\\) is calculated without any additional manipulation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), will the transform adequately capture all the frequency components inherent in \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform is designed to deconstruct a signal into its constituent frequency components, handling both real and imaginary parts, thus capturing the complete frequency spectrum of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
