  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation using the matrix \\\\( L \\\\), which operates in the complex function space by multiplying with the matrix \\\\( e^{i\\omega} \\\\), an operator associated with frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\. The system is analyzed for function \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\lambda z} \\\\), where \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nDoes the application of \\\\( L \\\\) to \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and later evaluation at \\\\( z = Z \\\\) without any other intervention result in the same output as if the transformation was not applied at all?",
  "Explanation": "When applying \\\\( L \\\\) to \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\lambda z} \\\\), the function is fundamentally altered to \\\\( e^{i\\omega}e^{\\lambda z} = e^{(\\lambda + i\\omega)z} \\\\. The result depends on the values of \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\), demonstrating that the frequency modulation changes the system's behavior.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation matrix L to the function h(z) at \\(z_0\\) leads to its transformation, which then evaluates to a specific value at \\(z = Z\\). This outcome is equivalent to the function's original value at \\(z = Z\\) if no transformation had been applied."
