  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution in a rod over time t is modeled by the heat equation \\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\), where k is the thermal diffusivity constant. We analyze the impact of applying a time-dependent heat source \\( S(x,t) = h(t) \\cdot \\cos(\\omega x) \\) along the rod.\n\nIf the heat source \\( S(x,t) \\) is applied to the rod at t = 0, and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\) without further intervention, will the temperature distribution \\( u(x,T) \\) for T = 10 be the same as if no heat source was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the heat source \\( S(x,t) \\) modifies the boundary and initial conditions of the heat equation, introducing additional energy into the system which affects the temperature distribution over time, resulting in a different \\( u(x,T) \\) at t = 10.",
