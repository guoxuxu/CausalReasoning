  "Problem": "The behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) is studied, where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time governed by the coupled differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = ax - by \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = bx + ay \\\\), where a and b are constants. The impact of a transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = e^{ct}z \\\\), where c is a real constant, is examined over time t.\n\nCan the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be precisely recovered after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "If the transformation has been applied, then the observed \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T comes from a scaled version of the initial condition, and without knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), it is impossible to uniquely recover \\\\( z_0 \\\\) since multiple initial conditions (scaled versions) can lead to similar trajectories under the differential equations.",
