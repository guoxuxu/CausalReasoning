  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We explore the effect of an integral transformation given by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant and T is a finite upper limit.\n\nIf \\\\( F(z) \\\\) was computed with a modified function \\\\( z'(t) = z(t) + e^{i\\\\gamma t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) is another frequency, will \\\\( F(z')(T) \\\\) solely depend on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) without being affected by \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( F(z') \\\\) will be affected by both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) due to the addition of the new frequency component \\\\( e^{i\\\\gamma t} \\\\). This modification alters the integration results significantly, resulting in a dependency on both frequencies.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The modification of z(t) to z'(t) introduces a new frequency component which affects F(z')(T); the original frequency ω in z(t) influences F(z)(T) independently; γ introduces a new oscillatory behavior in z'(t) that changes F(z')(T)."
