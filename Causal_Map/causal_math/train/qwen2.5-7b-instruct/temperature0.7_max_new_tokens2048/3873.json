  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system characterized by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We investigate the effect of the operator \\\\( F(x) = S^{-1}e^{Kt}Sx \\\\) over time t, where K is another diagonalizable matrix and S is the transformation matrix that diagonalizes D.\n\nIf \\\\( F(x) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) without further intervention, does \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T equal the evolution of \\\\( x_0 \\\\) under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) directly to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The operator \\\\( F(x) \\\\) modifies the initial state by applying \\\\( S^{-1}e^{Kt}S \\\\), which changes the system's trajectory. The dynamics are driven by both matrices D and K through the transformation, resulting in a state at time T that differs from that obtained by evolving \\\\( x_0 \\\\) directly under D.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the operator F(x) to x_0 at t=0 and allowing it to evolve under the dynamics defined by D from t=0 to t=T results in x(t) which is equivalent to the direct evolution of x_0 under D from t=0 to t=T, assuming K and S are chosen such that F(x) correctly represents the system's evolution."
