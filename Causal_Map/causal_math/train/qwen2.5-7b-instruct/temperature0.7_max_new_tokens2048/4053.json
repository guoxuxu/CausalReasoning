  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + A \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} = 0 \\\\), where A is a constant. We explore the behavior of the system under the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t, x)\\\\} = U(s, x) \\\\) and the subsequent inversion to the time domain.\n\nAssuming the initial condition \\\\( u(0, x) = u_0(x) \\\\) is transformed by the Laplace transform and then left to evolve by the given differential equation, will the inversion to the time domain yield the same solution as if directly solving the differential equation without the Laplace transform?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform is a linear operator that does not alter the inherent characteristics of a linear partial differential equation. Thus, the transformed problem solved in the s-domain and inverted back provides the same solution as the original time-domain problem, given appropriate handling of the boundary and initial conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u(0, x) directly influences the solution u(t, x) over time. The Laplace transform of u(t, x) results in U(s, x), which when inverted gives back u(t, x). The constant A directly causes the second spatial derivative ∂²u/∂x². The time derivative ∂u/∂t is inversely related to the spatial second derivative through the differential equation."
