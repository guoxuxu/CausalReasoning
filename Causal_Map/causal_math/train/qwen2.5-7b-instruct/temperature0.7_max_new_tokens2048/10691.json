  "Problem": "Evaluate the relationship between a Fourier transform given by the equation \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i \\\\omega t} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) and its impact on the system's behavior described by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} + a\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + bu = f(t) \\\\), where a and b are constants.\n\nIf an intervention is made by changing the value of \\\\( a \\\\) in the differential equation at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the end solution \\\\( u(t) \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) reflect only changes due to the new \\\\( a \\\\) value and not be influenced by transformations applied to \\\\( f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The solution \\\\( u(t) \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) will reflect both the history of the system (including any transformations to \\\\( f(t) \\\\)), and the immediate effects of the changed value of \\\\( a \\\\). Both the characteristics of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and the parameters of the equation influence the resultant behavior of the system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
