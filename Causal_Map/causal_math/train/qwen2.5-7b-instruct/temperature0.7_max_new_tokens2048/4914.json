  "Problem": "Consider the behaviour of the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\in \\mathbb{R} \\\\), under the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\\\). Analyze how transformations affect causality in the complex function mapping and their implications on the frequency domain.\n\nGiven the Laplace Transform output \\\\( \\mathcal{L}[z](s) \\\\), can we reliably infer the precise time-domain signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without knowing the exact value of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\( \\mathcal{L}[z](s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-i\\\\omega} \\\\) only indicates the presence of a frequency component at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), but without additional information about \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), multiple time-domain signals could correspondingly generate similar features in the Laplace domain, making exact inference of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) uncertain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
