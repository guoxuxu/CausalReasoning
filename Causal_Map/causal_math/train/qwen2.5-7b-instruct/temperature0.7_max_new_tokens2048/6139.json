  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical scenario where a signal x(t) undergoes a Fourier Transform, defined as \\\\(\\\\hat{x}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} x(t) e^{-i \\\\omega t} dt\\\\). Further, this transformed signal is modified via a filter function H(ω), and the composite effect \\\\(y(t)\\\\) is obtained by applying the Inverse Fourier Transform to \\\\(H(\\\\omega) \\\\hat{x}(\\\\omega)\\\\).\n\nIf at time t_1, an additional filter K(ω) is applied to the system, will the output y(t) at T > t_1 solely rely on the original filter H(ω) without considering K(ω)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of a new filter K(ω) alters the system's behaviour by potentially modifying the frequency components of the existing system state. The final output y(T) depends on the composite effects of both H(ω) and K(ω), not merely the original H(ω).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "x(t) → \\(\\hat{x}(\\omega)\\); \\(\\hat{x}(\\omega)\\) → \\(H(\\omega) \\hat{x}(\\omega)\\); \\(H(\\omega) \\hat{x}(\\omega)\\) → \\(y(t)\\)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input signal x(t) Fourier transforms to become the frequency domain representation \\(\\hat{x}(\\omega)\\), which is then filtered by H(\\omega) to produce the intermediate signal H(\\omega) \\(\\hat{x}(\\omega)\\), which inverse Fourier transforms back to the time domain to yield the output y(t). Applying an additional filter K(\\omega) at t_1 does not affect the output y(t) for T > t_1 if it is not incorporated into the filtering step."
