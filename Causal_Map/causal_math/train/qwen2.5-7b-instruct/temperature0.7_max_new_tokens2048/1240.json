  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with an inductor, capacitor, and resistor (LCR circuit) where its behavior is described by the differential equation \\\\(L \\\\frac{d^2i}{dt^2} + R \\\\frac{di}{dt} + \\\\frac{1}{C}i = 0\\\\). An external voltage source \\\\(V(t) = V_0 e^{st}\\\\) is considered as a function transformation applying to the system.\n\nConsidering the observed current \\\\(i(T)\\\\) at T, can we precisely determine which voltage sources were used during the time interval from t = 0 to T?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the linear superposition principle and the potential overlap in the effects caused by different frequencies 's' and 'r' of the voltage sources, it is impossible to explicitly discern the impact and presence of each voltage source merely by observing \\\\(i(T)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
