  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\) evolved under the differential system \\( \\dot{z} = z^2 + c \\) where \\( c \\) is a non-zero complex constant. Investigations include the effect of executing a transformation given by the integral transform \\( \\mathcal{F}(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt \\), with \\( s \\) being a complex parameter.\n\nIf \\( \\mathcal{F}(z) \\) is computed for \\( z(t) \\) initially at t=0 and then allowed to evolve under \\( \\dot{z} = z^2 + c \\) without any further transformation, does \\( z(t) \\) at t=T, calculated directly from the differential system, result identically to using \\( \\mathcal{F}(z) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Convolving \\( z \\) with \\( e^{-st} \\) under \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) would alter \\( z \\)'s evolution trajectory due to the incorporation of the exponential decay term from the integral transform, even if no explicit intervention is applied after \\( \\mathcal{F} \\). This manipulation changes how \\( z \\) evolves over time according to the differential equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial value z(0) directly influences z(t) which then evolves to z(T) under the differential system. The constant c directly causes changes in z(t). The parameter s influences the integral transform F(z), but this transform does not directly cause z(T) in the absence of further transformations."
