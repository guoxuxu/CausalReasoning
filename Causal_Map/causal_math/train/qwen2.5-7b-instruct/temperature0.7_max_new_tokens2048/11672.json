  "Problem": "Analyze a continuous-time signal processing system where an input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is first transformed via a Fourier transform, generating \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\), and is then processed by a system with a frequency response function \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\). The output is \\\\( Y(\\\\omega) = H(\\\\omega)X(\\\\omega) \\\\) and it undergoes an inverse Fourier transform to produce the output signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\).\n\nCan we determine the specific changes made to \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) by observing the differences in \\\\( y(t) \\\\) after the intervention, without knowing the exact nature of the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "While changes in the output signal might indicate that an intervention occurred, determining the exact nature or specifics of the intervention in \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) purely from \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is not typically feasible because multiple alterations to \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) could produce similar effects in the output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map_integration": "The input signal x(t) is transformed by the Fourier transform to generate X(ω), which is then processed by the frequency response function H(ω) to produce Y(ω). The inverse Fourier transform of Y(ω) yields the output signal y(t). Changes in H(ω) will affect Y(ω), which in turn will alter y(t)."
