  "Problem": "Assume a function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) represents a complex-valued function where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time. This function is transformed by a complex exponential \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was simply evolved to t = T without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies both the amplitude and phase of the original function \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The factor \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) introduces a continuous rotation in the complex plane, altering the trajectory and thus the final state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any later time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial value z_0 at t=0 influences z(0), which evolves to z(T) under the transformation f(z) = e^(iωt)z(t). The constant ω determines the transformation f(z), which in turn affects z(T)."
