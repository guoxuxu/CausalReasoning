  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We look into the effect of a transformation described by \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) applied to the complex plane.\n\nCan we determine the initial value \\\\( z(0) \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any time \\\\( t \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) occurred, it is not possible to accurately deduce \\\\( z(0) \\\\). The quadratic transformation could have altered the magnitude and phase trajectory, leading to ambiguity in inferring the initial state.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial value z(0) influences z(t) through the function z(t) = e^(it), and applying the transformation h(z) = z^2 to z(t) results in z(t). Knowing z(t) and the transformation h(z) allows us to trace back to z(t-1), but determining z(0) without this information is not possible."
