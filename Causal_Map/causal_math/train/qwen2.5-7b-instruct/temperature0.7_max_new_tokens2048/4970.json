  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant complex matrix. We evaluate the impact of the Fourier Transform and its inverse defined by the function \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-2\\\\pi i \\\\xi t} z(t) dt \\\\) and \\\\( F^{-1}(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{2\\\\pi i \\\\xi t} z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nAfter observing the Fourier Transformed state \\\\( F(z)(T) \\\\) at t = T, can we accurately infer the original state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without knowing if and when transformations were applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation by the Fourier Transform may alter fundamental attributes of the system, such as phase and amplitude in ways that are non-reversible without additional information on when and how transformations took place because they fundamentally change the depiction of the system in frequency space versus time space.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map_integration": "The Fourier transform of the state at time T (F(z)(T)) causally influences the original state at time 0 (z(0)), through the intermediate state z(t) which is directly caused by the constant complex matrix A."
