  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant complex number and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. This function describes a circular motion in the complex plane. We analyze whether certain transformations can infer causal relationships or predict the system's behavior accurately.\n\nGiven the observed data for \\\\( z'(T) \\\\) without prior knowledge of \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\), can we determine exactly the original phase shift applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the specific value of \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) applied at t = 0, it's impossible to distinguish the effect caused by the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from the modified \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) based solely on observing \\\\( z'(T) \\\\). The observed data could emerge from various initial phase shifts due to the periodic nature of the function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
