  "Problem": "Consider a complex integral transformation of a function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) defined as \\\\( G(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}g(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable and the integral transformation is the Laplace Transform. We study the effect of a linear differential operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) applied to \\\\( g(t) \\\\) defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}g = \\\\frac{d^2g}{dt^2} - 2\\\\frac{dg}{dt} + g \\\\).\n\nGiven the Laplace Transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\) of a function after applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), can we determine the original function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), it's impossible to correctly rewind to the original form of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) as transformations induced by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) (like damping and frequency shifts) significantly alter the original function’s characteristics which are not directly reversible solely from \\\\( G(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace Transform G(s) of a function g(t) after applying the differential operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) is causally related to the original function g(t) through the transformation process, but determining g(t) from G(s) without knowing if \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) was applied is not possible."
