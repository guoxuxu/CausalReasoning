  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}w \\\\) describes the time evolution of a complex vector \\\\( w \\\\) under a complex transformation, where A is a constant matrix and i represents the imaginary unit. The effect of an integral transformation characterized by the operator \\\\( T(t) \\\\) which modifies the vector by \\\\( T(t)w = w + itAw \\\\) is analyzed over time t.\n\nCan we unambiguously determine the times and nature (whether \\\\( T(t) \\\\) or \\\\( e^{iAt} \\\\)) of interventions used during the system's evolution to \\\\( z(T) \\\\), based solely on the knowledge of the state at time T?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping influences of \\\\( e^{iAt} \\\\) and any uses of \\\\( T(t) \\\\) complicate retroactively discerning specific interventions. Multiple configurations and timings of applying \\\\( T(t) \\\\) and the evolution under \\\\( e^{iAt} \\\\) can lead to the same final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), making it impossible to uniquely identify the interventions and their times.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The constant matrix A and the imaginary unit i directly cause the time evolution of the complex vector w through the function z(t). The operator T(t) directly causes the modification of the vector w, leading to the state z(T) at time T."
