  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. We examine the effects of an integral transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{Ct}z dt \\\\), where C is another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the given dynamics \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) without any further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T using the original dynamics?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) changes the initial conditions by adding an integral effect that modifies the paths of x and y, influenced by matrix C. This generally produces a different evolution at time T, as the integral accumulation distinctly alters the trajectory.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial values x(0) and y(0) directly cause x(T) and y(T) respectively through the dynamics defined by matrices A and B. The matrix C influences the integral transformation f(z), which in turn affects z(T). The initial function z(0) determines the input for the integral transformation f(z), and the result of this transformation, f(z), directly causes the value of z(T) after evolving according to the given dynamics."
