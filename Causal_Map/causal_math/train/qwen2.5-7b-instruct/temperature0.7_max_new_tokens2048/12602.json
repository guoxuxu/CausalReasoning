  "Problem": "Assume a system of partial differential equations governing heat flow in a rod, described by \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where u is the temperature and k is the diffusion constant. Explore the consequences of applying a temperature-dependent transformation \\\\( f(u) = e^{\\\\lambda u} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf a new transformation \\\\( g(u) = e^{\\\\mu u} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\) is another constant) is applied at a particular time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention, will the final temperature profile \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the heat equation parameter k and not on \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention \\\\( g(u) \\\\) alters the temperature distribution again in a non-linear manner similar to \\\\( f(u) \\\\). Thus, the final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) will be affected by both interventions (\\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\)) along with the diffusion constant k. All these factors cooperatively determine the end temperature profile.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
