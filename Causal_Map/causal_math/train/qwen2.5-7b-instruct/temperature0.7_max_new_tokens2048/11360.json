  "Problem": "Examine a system governed by a complex function \\\\( g(z) = z^2 + c \\\\) where c is a complex constant. Let's focus on its behavior under the mapping \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z \\), where \\\\( \\omega \\) is a real constant representing an angular frequency, and t represents time.\n\nCan the type of intervention (rotation versus inverse rotation) or the parameters (like \\\\( \\omega \\\\)) used be unequivocally back-calculated from the final observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the impact of non-linear transformations and rotational dynamics, multiple different interventions or parameter values might lead to the same resulting state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The ambiguity in transformation effects due to complex dynamics prevents a unique determination of the interventions from the final state alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
