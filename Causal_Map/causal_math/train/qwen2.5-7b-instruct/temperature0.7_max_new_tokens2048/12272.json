  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing dynamic states of a system, governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. A transformation defined as \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) where C is a complex constant matrix is introduced.\n\nWithout further intervention, if \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and allowed to evolve under the system's original dynamics, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\), the state at a later time T, be equivalent to the result of evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) directly under the combined original dynamics of x and y?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) changes the initial condition by multiplying \\\\( z_0 \\\\) with \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\), thus introducing a new dynamic dependent on the properties of C alongside A and B. The time evolution of both parameters leads to a state at time T that deviates from the original trajectory without the transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state x(t) and y(t) together determine z(t); applying the transformation f(z) to z_0 at t=0 and allowing it to evolve under the original dynamics results in z(T) which reflects the combined effect of the original dynamics on z_0."
