  "Problem": "Consider a complex function given by \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\) where \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) are real functions of time \\( t \\), obeying the differential equations \\( \\dot{u} = Au \\) and \\( \\dot{v} = Bv \\), respectively, with constant matrices A and B. We explore the effect of an integral transformation \\( \\mathcal{T}(z) = \\int_0^t e^{-\\lambda s} z(s) \\, ds \\) on this complex function over time.\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), an intervention applying a new transformation \\( \\mathcal{S}(z) = \\int_0^t e^{-\\mu s} z(s) \\, ds \\) (where \\( \\mu \\) is a constant) is introduced, will the endpoint \\( \\mathcal{T}(z)(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depend only on the differential equations and not on \\( \\lambda \\) or \\( \\mu \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\( \\mathcal{S}(z) \\) as an intervention modifies the evolution of \\( z(t) \\), making the final transformed function dependent on both \\( \\lambda \\) and \\( \\mu \\), as these parameters dictate the nature of their respective transformations and influence the overall result at time \\( T \\).",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The value of T(∫_0^t e^(-λs) z(s) ds) at time T depends on u(t), v(t), A, B, and λ, while the value of T(∫_0^t e^(-μs) z(s) ds) at time T depends on u(t), v(t), A, B, and μ. Introducing the transformation S(z) at t1 does not affect the dependency of T(∫_0^t e^(-λs) z(s) ds) on λ."
