  "Problem": "We consider a system where the current at any time t in an electrical circuit is determined by the integral transformation \\\\( I(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-(t - \\\\tau)}V(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where \\\\( V(t) \\\\) represents the voltage source function. We also consider a time-dependent change in resistance modeled by the function \\\\( R(t) = 1 + \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\) affecting the voltage source.\n\nIf we adjust the system by applying an intervention that stabilizes resistance (\\\\( R(t) = R_0) \\\\) at a certain moment t_1, will the current \\\\( I(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the voltage source \\\\( V(t) \\\\) and not on the original resistance function?",
  "Explanation": "The adjustment modifies the system's dynamics from t_1 onwards, changing how the voltage affects the current and the system’s history with its original varying resistance still influences \\\\( I(t) \\\\) up to t_1. Therefore, I(T) is affected by both the historical and intervened dynamics.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The current I(t) is directly influenced by the voltage source V(t), and the voltage source V(t) is indirectly influenced by the resistance function R(t). Stabilizing the resistance R(t) at a constant value R_0 after t_1 will remove the indirect influence of R(t) on V(t) for t > t_1, but I(t) for T > t_1 will still depend on V(t)."
