  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\) within the context of complex functions, where A is a constant matrix and x is an initial vector. The operation \\\\( H(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{B(t-s)}z(s) ds \\\\), where B is another constant matrix, defines an integral transformation on z(t).\n\nCan the original vector \\\\( x \\\\) be deduced directly from the output of \\\\( H(z) \\\\) after time T without knowing the matrix A?",
  "Explanation": "The operation \\\\( H(z) \\\\) integrates the effect of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over an interval influenced by matrix A. Without knowledge of A, the specific effects of A on the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and subsequently on \\\\( H(z) \\\\) are unclear, preventing the direct deduction of x.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
