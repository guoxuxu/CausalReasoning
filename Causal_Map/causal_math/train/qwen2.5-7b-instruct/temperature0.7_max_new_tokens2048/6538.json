  "Problem": "Consider the integration transformation \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-zt} f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a given function and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. This transformation maps a function from the time domain to the Laplace transform in the complex domain.\n\nGiven the transform \\\\( G(z) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without knowing any prior modifications such as substitutions or alterations at specific points?",
  "Explanation": "Without precise information about modifications to \\\\( f(t) \\\\), it is not possible to uniquely reverse engineer \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from \\\\( G(z) \\\\) alone. The inverse transform may yield multiple valid functions that could differ at unobserved or unspecified points, especially if localized alterations are undetected in the given domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
