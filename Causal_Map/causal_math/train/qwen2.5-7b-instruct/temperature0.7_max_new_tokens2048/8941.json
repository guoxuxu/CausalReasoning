  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution over a rod of length L is governed by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. The transformation considered is applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) to the initial temperature distribution \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u(x,0))\\\\) is applied to the initial function and then allowed to evolve under the heat equation without further intervention, will the resulting temperature distribution \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) was directly evolved to T under the heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform changes the initial condition from \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) to a different function, altering the initial spectrum of temperature distribution. This change in the spectral composition modifies how heat propagates along the rod, leading to a different temperature profile at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial temperature distribution u(x,0) directly causes the temperature distribution u(x,t) at any time t. Applying the Fourier transform to u(x,0) and then evolving it under the heat equation directly causes the same temperature distribution u(x,t) at any time t as directly evolving u(x,0) under the heat equation."
