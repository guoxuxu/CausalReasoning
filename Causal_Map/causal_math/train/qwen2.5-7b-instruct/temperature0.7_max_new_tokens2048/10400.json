  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation governed by the transformation matrix \\\\( L \\\\) and given an initial condition \\\\( x_0 \\\\) in a vector space. We evaluate the effect of an operator \\\\( T \\\\) which applies an integral transformation with kernel \\\\( K(s, t) \\\\) affecting the system's evolution.\n\nGiven the final state of the system at t = T, can we determine exactly which transformations were applied (\\\\( T \\\\), \\\\( M \\\\), or both), solely based on the final state?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying distinct transformations from the final state alone is challenging due to the potential for different transformations to yield equivalent effects, especially when they involve integral and linear transformations that can compensate or mask each other's influence on the system's trajectory.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
