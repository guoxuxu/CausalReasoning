  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We analyze the effect of a linear transformation given by matrix \\\\( M \\\\) on this function over time t.\n\nAt t = T, observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) under the transformation \\\\( M \\\\), can we determine the original function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without knowing \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of \\\\( M \\\\), the transformation applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) could have various possible effects (rotations, scaling), making it impossible to reliably trace back to \\\\( z(0) \\\\) as multiple different transformations could yield the same observed outcome at \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation matrix M changes z(0) into z(T), and z(0) directly influences z(T) through this transformation."
