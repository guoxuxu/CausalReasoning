  "Problem": "Examine a system described by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We investigate how the application of the Laplace transform, denoted as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\), affects the system's evaluation over time.\n\nIf the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(u)\\\\) is applied to an initial function \\\\(u_0\\\\) and the transformed function is then evolved according to the modified equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\hat{u}}{\\\\partial s} = \\\\mathcal{L}(L(u))\\\\), will the inverse transform of \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(s,T)\\\\) at time T yield the same result as evolving \\\\(u_0\\\\) directly under the original PDE to time T?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform changes the domain of the problem and modifies how the differential operator L acts in the transformed space. When evolving \\\\(\\\\hat{u}\\\\) under \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(L(u))\\\\), and then applying the inverse Laplace transform, the interaction effects in the transformed domain can lead to different outcomes than direct evolution under the original PDE.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial function u_0 directly causes u(t) through the original PDE, and directly causes hat{u}(s) through the Laplace transform. The operator L transforms u to L(u), which is then transformed by the Laplace transform to give hat{u}(s). The evolution of hat{u}(s) under the modified equation leads to u(t) through the inverse Laplace transform, which at time T gives u(T)."
