  "Problem": "Consider a thermal system where the temperature distribution over a rod is described by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), with k being the thermal conductivity. Study the effect of a Fourier Transform \\\\( F(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty u(x,t) e^{-i\\\\omega x} dx \\\\) applied to the temperature distribution, especially when analyzing the system's response to external heat sources.\n\nAfter observing the Fourier-transformed temperature distribution \\\\( F(u(x,T)) \\\\) at time T, can we accurately trace back to determine \\\\( F(u(x,0)) \\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the evolution of temperature adheres strictly to the heat equation, and the transformation properties of the Fourier Transform under this differential operator are well-defined, it is entirely feasible to reconstruct \\\\( F(u(x,0)) \\\\) from \\\\( F(u(x,T)) \\\\) using the inverse operation and back-calculating based on the equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_map": "u(x,t) → F(u(x,t)); F(u(x,t)) → F(u(x,T)); T → F(u(x,T)); F(u(x,0)) ← F(u(x,T)); thermal conductivity (k) → u(x,t); external heat sources → u(x,t)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The temperature distribution u(x,t) is influenced by the thermal conductivity k and external heat sources. Applying the Fourier transform to u(x,t) yields F(u(x,t)), which remains consistent over time T. Therefore, F(u(x,0)) can be traced back from F(u(x,T)) if no additional information is lost during the transformation process."
