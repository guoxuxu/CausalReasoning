  "Problem": "Consider the integration transformation of a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) defined on a contour in the complex plane. The contour integral \\\\( \\\\int_C f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\) is analyzed over a closed path C. Let \\\\( a \\\\) be a complex constant.\n\nGiven the value of the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C e^{az} \\\\, dz \\\\), can we determine the specific value of \\\\( a \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The value of the integral alone, especially in complex function contexts, does not uniquely determine \\\\( a \\\\), as different values can lead to the same integral due to the periodic properties of the exponential function and the specific geometry of C.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
