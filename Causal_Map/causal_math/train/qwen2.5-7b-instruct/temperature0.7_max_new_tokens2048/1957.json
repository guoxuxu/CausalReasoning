  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time, representing the real and imaginary parts respectively. An integral transformation defined as \\\\( w(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At}z(s) ds \\\\), where A is a constant complex number is applied.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is given for t = 0 and allowed to evolve according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Az \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( w(T) \\\\), calculated directly using the transformation be the same as if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was simply evolved to t = T and transformed?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( w(t) \\\\) integrates the effect of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time, accumulating differences that arise due to the exponential multiplier \\\\( e^{At} \\\\), which depends on A and the interval [0, T]. These differences are not captured by merely evolving \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to t = T and then applying the transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial value of z at t=0 influences its evolution over time according to the differential equation \\(\\dot{z} = Az\\), which in turn determines w(T) through the integral transformation."
