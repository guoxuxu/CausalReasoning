  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions describing the system's state over time. We analyze the impact of a Hilbert transform \\\\( H \\\\) which transforms a real function into another real function, typically shifting each frequency component by \\\\(-\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}\\\\).\n\nGiven the system’s state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to definitively determine which transforms (\\\\( H \\\\), \\\\( G \\\\), or both) were applied, based solely on the observed state at that time?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific interventions applied (either \\\\( H \\\\), \\\\( G \\\\), or both) just from the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is challenging due to the possible overlaps in effects and the non-reversible nature of certain transformations. Each intervention, altering phase or other properties, contributes cumulatively and potentially non-distinguishably to the final state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
