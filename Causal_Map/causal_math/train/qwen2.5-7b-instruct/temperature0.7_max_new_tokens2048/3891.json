  "Problem": "Consider a complex function represented by \\\\( z = x + yi \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are real numbers and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The function to analyze is \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant complex number. The transformations are evaluated for their effect on the magnitude and phase of \\\\( z \\\\) over a variable \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf, at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{bz} \\\\) (where \\\\( b \\\\) is another constant complex number) is applied as an intervention, will the characteristics of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be determined solely by \\\\( a \\\\) and not \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional intervention with \\\\( g(z) = e^{bz} \\\\) introduces another variable influencing the trajectory of \\\\( z \\\\). The characteristics of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on both \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), as each exponential transformation contributes uniquely to the resultant magnitude and phase changes.",
