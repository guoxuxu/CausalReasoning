  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. For this scenario, let's investigate the effects of a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) defined as an integral transformation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), changing the function from \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( F(z(t)) \\\\), can the final form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for t > t_1 be solely determined by the original equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without considering effects of \\\\( F \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( F \\\\) changes the function to its spectrum which carries different properties based on frequency components of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), influenced beyond just the growth rate stipulated by \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\). This spectral transformation will fundamentally alter the dynamics and thus cannot be solely resolved by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Fourier transform F(z(t)) does not directly cause changes in z(t) after time t_1; the evolution of z(t) for t > t_1 is governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\) without considering the effect of F."
