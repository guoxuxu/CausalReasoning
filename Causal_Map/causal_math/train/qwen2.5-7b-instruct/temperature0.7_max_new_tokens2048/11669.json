  "Problem": "Analyze a continuous-time signal processing system where an input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is first transformed via a Fourier transform, generating \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\), and is then processed by a system with a frequency response function \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\). The output is \\\\( Y(\\\\omega) = H(\\\\omega)X(\\\\omega) \\\\) and it undergoes an inverse Fourier transform to produce the output signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed into \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) and processed by \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\), then inverted back to time domain to get \\\\( y(t) \\\\), without any modifications to \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\), will the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) be affected solely by the characteristics of \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) and the initial \\\\( x(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is directly affected by the initial input \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and the characteristics of \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) through the Fourier and inverse Fourier transformations, maintaining a causative flow from input to output affected only by these factors.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
