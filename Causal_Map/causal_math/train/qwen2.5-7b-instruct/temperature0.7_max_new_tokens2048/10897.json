  "Problem": "Consider a complex mapping scenario given by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), where z is a complex variable. We examine the behavior of the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = z + a \\\\), where a is a complex constant, over the complex plane.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in the complex plane and then \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is evaluated at this new point without further intervention, will \\\\( f(g(z_0)) \\\\) be the same as \\\\( f(z_0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) = z + a \\\\) shifts the point in the complex plane, and since \\\\( e^{z} \\\\) is not a periodic function except along the imaginary axis, the outcome of \\\\( f(g(z_0)) = e^{z_0 + a} \\\\) will generally differ except in special cases where \\\\( a \\\\) is purely imaginary and a multiple of \\\\( 2\\\\pi i \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying g to z_0 first shifts its position in the complex plane, then applying f to the result of g(z_0) transforms it via the exponential function, which is different from directly transforming z_0 with f without the intermediate shift by g."
