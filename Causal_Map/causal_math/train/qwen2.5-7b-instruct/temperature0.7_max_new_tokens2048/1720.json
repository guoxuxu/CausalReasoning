  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = w(u) \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex function of the complex variable \\\\( u \\\\). Now investigate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](u) = \\\\int_C f(v)e^{-uv} dv \\\\), where C is a contour in the complex plane, and \\\\( f \\\\) is a complex function.\n\nKnowing the result after applying transformations \\\\( S \\\\) and \\\\( T \\\\) on \\\\( w(u) \\\\), can we discern if either or both transformations were applied, or revert to the original \\\\( w(u) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the combined effects of \\\\( S \\\\) and \\\\( T \\\\) through complex contour integrals and their nontrivial composition, pinpointing exactly which transformations were applied or reverse-engineering to the original function \\\\( w(u) \\\\) without more specific data about the contours or nature of exponential modifiers is highly challenging.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying transformations T and S successively on w(u) results in a Result that may not uniquely identify whether T or S was applied, or allow reverting back to w(u)."
