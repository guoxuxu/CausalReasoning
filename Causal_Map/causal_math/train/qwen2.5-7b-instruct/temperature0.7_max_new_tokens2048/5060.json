  "Problem": "Consider the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k \\\\Delta u \\\\) in a domain \\\\( D \\\\) with boundary conditions prescribed on \\\\( \\\\partial D \\\\). An input function \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\) represents the external heat added per unit time. We consider the impact of the integral transformation \\\\( T[u](x,t) = u(x,t) + \\\\int_0^t h(x, \\\\tau) \\\\, d\\\\tau \\\\) on the system over time t.\n\nCan we precisely deduce both the original heat input function \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( j(x,t) \\\\) from the final temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) given at time T, by only observing \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\) and \\\\( j(x,t) \\\\) can lead to the same final state \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\), particularly if their effects are overlapping or similar in nature. This non-uniqueness makes it impossible to disentangle the contributions of \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\) and \\\\( j(x,t) \\\\) solely based on the final temperature distribution.",
