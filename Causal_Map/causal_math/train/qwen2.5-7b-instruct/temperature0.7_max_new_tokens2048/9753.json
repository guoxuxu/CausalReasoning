  "Problem": "Consider a system where the variable \\\\(z\\\\) is transformed by the complex function \\\\(f(z) = e^{iz}\\\\). We analyze the outcome of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a sequence \\\\(z_n\\\\) where \\\\(n = 0, 1, ..., N-1\\\\) and its implications on the transformation defined by \\\\(f(z)\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\(f(z_n)\\\\) is applied to each element in the sequence, and then the DFT is taken of this transformed sequence, will the spectrum be the same as if the DFT was directly applied to the original sequence \\\\(z_n\\\\) without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(f(z_n) = e^{iz_n}\\\\) before the DFT transforms each element by adding a phase shift dependent on the value of each \\\\(z_n\\\\). This alteration changes the magnitude and phase of the spectrum, resulting in a different frequency representation compared to applying the DFT directly to the untransformed sequence.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the function f(z_n) to each element in the sequence z_n results in a transformed sequence, which when subjected to the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) produces DFT_transformed_sequence; applying the DFT directly to the original sequence z_n produces DFT_original_sequence."
