  "Problem": "Consider a differential equation representing the rate of change in the electrical potential V across a capacitor in an RC circuit, given by \\\\( \\\\dot{V} = -\\\\frac{1}{RC}V \\\\). A step function intervention via a voltage source modifies the potential by adding a function \\\\( h(t) = He^{Dt} \\\\), where H, D are constants and t is time.\n\nIf an additional intervention \\\\( k(t) = Ke^{Mt} \\\\) (where K, M are constants) is applied at time t = t_1, will the final voltage \\\\( V(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 solely depend on the original differential equation without the effects of H or K?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of interventions \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( k(t) \\\\) at different times adds complexity to the system dynamics, causing the final state \\\\( V(T) \\\\) to depend not just on the original constant R and C but also on the parameters and forms of H, D, K, and M. Each intervention adjusts the trajectory and the final state in a unique way.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
