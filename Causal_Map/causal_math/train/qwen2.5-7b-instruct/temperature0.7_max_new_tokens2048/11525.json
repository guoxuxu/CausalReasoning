  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) by applying a complex Fourier transform defined as \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty f(x) e^{-i\\\\omega x} \\\\, dx \\\\). Analyze the impact of a linear differential operator \\\\( L = \\\\frac{d}{dx} \\\\) on the function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and how it affects the transformed function \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\).\n\nIf the operator \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) before applying the Fourier transform, will the result \\\\( F_L(\\\\omega) \\\\) from \\\\( Lf(x) \\\\) match the Fourier transform of \\\\( f(x) \\\\) after modification by the operator?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the differential operator \\\\( L \\\\) to \\\\( f(x) \\\\) first alters the function to \\\\( Lf(x) \\\\). The Fourier transform of the resulting function \\\\( Lf(x) \\\\) is not the same as \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\); instead, it introduces a multiplicative factor of \\\\( -i\\\\omega \\\\) due to the differentiation theorem in Fourier analysis, leading to \\\\( F_L(\\\\omega) = -i\\\\omega F(\\\\omega) \\\\).",
