  "Problem": "Suppose we have a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonal matrix. Consider the effect of applying a linear transformation \\\\( T(x) = Mx \\\\) where M is a square matrix, at various times.\n\nKnowing only the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time T, can we accurately determine which transformations were applied (\\\\( T(x) \\\\), \\\\( U(x) \\\\), or both), and their specific time of application?",
  "Explanation": "The state at \\\\( x(T) \\\\) can arise from various combinations of initial transformations, their order, and timing. Without more information about when and which transformations were applied, it is impossible to reverse-engineer the exact sequence of transformations and timings just based on the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying a linear transformation T(x) or U(x) at time T changes the state x to x(T). Knowing x(T) at time T allows us to infer that some transformation was applied, but does not uniquely determine which transformation(s) were applied or when."
