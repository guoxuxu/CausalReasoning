  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the temperature distribution over a rod of length L is governed by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where k is the thermal diffusivity. We explore the impact of an initial heat distribution described by \\\\( u(x, 0) = h(x) \\\\), a predefined function, and the influence of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{h}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega x}h(x) dx \\\\) on this distribution.\n\nIf \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is initially applied as \\\\( u(x, 0) = h(x) \\\\) and the system evolves based on the heat equation without further intervention, will the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at a later time t > 0, only depend on \\\\( h(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution of the temperature distribution in the heat equation is directly dependent on the initial condition \\\\( h(x) \\\\). The solution \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) for t > 0 is determined entirely by \\\\( h(x) \\\\) and the properties of the heat equation, assuming no additional external influences alter the system.",
