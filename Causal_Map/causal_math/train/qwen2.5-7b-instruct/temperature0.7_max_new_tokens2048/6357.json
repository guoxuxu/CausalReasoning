  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the complex differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z + \\lambda z^2 \\), where \\( \\omega \\) and \\( \\lambda \\) are constants. We will explore the effects of applying the transformation defined by \\( g(z) = e^{kt}z \\), where \\( k \\) is a constant, on the behavior of \\( z(t) \\) over time.\n\nIf \\( g(z) \\) is applied to a complex number \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z + \\lambda z^2 \\) without further intervention, will \\( z(t) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( z_0 \\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z + \\lambda z^2 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Transforming \\( z_0 \\) by \\( g(z) \\) at t = 0 modifies the initial condition, which alters the path that \\( z(t) \\) follows. The transformation \\( e^{kt} \\) scales the initial condition and can change magnitude and phase, particularly influenced by the nonlinear term \\( \\lambda z^2 \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation g(z) = e^(kt) to z at t=0 and allowing it to evolve under the differential equation ˙z = iωz + λz^2 results in z(t) at any time t being equivalent to directly evolving z_0 under the same differential equation from t=0 to t."
