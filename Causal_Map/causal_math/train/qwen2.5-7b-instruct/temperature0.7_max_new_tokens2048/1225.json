  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) where L is a linear differential operator. We explore the impact of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) applied to \\\\(u\\\\), resulting in \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t)\\\\), and its subsequent evolution.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) at t = 0, and then the transformed function \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t)\\\\) is evolved under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\hat{u}}{\\\\partial t} = L\\\\hat{u}\\\\) without any intervention, will \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) at T = t be the same as if \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) was directly transformed at T = t?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution of \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t)\\\\) after the Fourier transform and its direct transformation at any later time T will yield the same results due to the linearity of the differential operator and the properties of the Fourier transform preserving the dynamics of the system under linear operations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u(x, 0) Fourier-transformed at t=0 (hat{u}(k, 0)) evolves over time according to the differential equation to produce hat{u}(k, T), which is equivalent to directly transforming u(x, t) at any time t=T (hat{u}(k, t))."
