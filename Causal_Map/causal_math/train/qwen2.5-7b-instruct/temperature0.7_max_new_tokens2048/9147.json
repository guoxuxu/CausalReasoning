  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the integral equation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} K(t,s) x(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( K(t,s) \\\\) is a given kernel function and \\\\( x(s) \\\\) is the input function. Analyze the behavior when applying a transformation \\\\( g(x) = x + h(t) \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is another function.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention modifies the input function from \\\\( x(s) \\\\) to \\\\( x(s) + j(s) \\\\) where \\\\( j(t) \\\\) is a new function, will the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at time T be influenced solely by the original kernel \\\\( K(t,s) \\\\) and not by the previous transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention introducing \\\\( j(s) \\\\) adds another layer of modification to the input, which affects the overall outcome. Therefore, the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at time T will reflect the combined influences of the original kernel \\\\( K(t,s) \\\\), the initial transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\), and the subsequent intervention, making it dependent on all modifications.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
