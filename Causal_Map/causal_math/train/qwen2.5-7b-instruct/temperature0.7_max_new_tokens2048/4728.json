  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We are examining how the Laplace transform, which transforms \\\\( z(t) \\\\) into \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i} \\\\) with complex s, affects our causal understanding of this system.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i} + \\\\frac{1}{s + 1} \\\\) at time T, can we decisively conclude whether the system experienced the specific intervention \\\\( z(t_1) = e^{-t_1} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the Laplace transformed function indicates additional components, this does not necessarily imply a precise intervention type. The presence of \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s + 1} \\\\) could result from various interventions or modifications; hence we cannot specify the exact intervention type or condition change at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) based solely on \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The original function z(t) influences its Laplace transform Z(s), and a specific value z(t1) influences the same Z(s)."
