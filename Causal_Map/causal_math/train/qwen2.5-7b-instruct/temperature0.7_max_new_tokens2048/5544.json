  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system represented by a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) where \\\\( L(z) = Az + B \\\\), with \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) as matrices. We explore the role of a linear transformation represented by matrix \\\\( M \\\\) that modifies the input \\\\( z_0 \\\\) by the function \\\\( f(z) = Mz \\\\).\n\nKnowing the outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we ascertain what transformations were applied (whether \\\\( M \\\\), \\\\( N \\\\), or both) only from the final value \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) might result from various sequences of the transformations, and the overlapping effects of \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) can yield the same endpoint through different intermediary states. Hence, it's often not possible to definitively determine the applications of \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) solely based on the end result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
