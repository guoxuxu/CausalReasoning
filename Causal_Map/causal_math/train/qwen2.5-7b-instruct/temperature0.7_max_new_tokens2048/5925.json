  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a linear partial differential equation (PDE) of the form \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + L(u) = 0\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear operator. We examine the effect of applying a Fourier transform, denoted as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), that changes the representation of \\\\(u\\\\) from the time domain to the frequency domain.\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\(u_0\\\\) is transformed by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) and evolved under the transformed PDE without any additional manipulation, will the resulting function at time \\\\(T\\\\), after applying the inverse Fourier transform, be identical to the function obtained by directly solving the original PDE with \\\\(u_0\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Fourier transform is a linear isomorphism in this context, applying it to the initial condition and then evolving under the transformed PDE conserves the relationships and properties across the transformation. Solving in the frequency domain and converting back gives the exact solution as solving in the original time domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u_0 directly causes u(T) through the transformation and evolution process, which involves applying the Fourier transform, evolving under the transformed PDE, and then applying the inverse Fourier transform. This process indirectly causes Δu(T), which is the change in u from the initial condition to time T. The operator L directly influences Δu(T) through the evolution of u in the frequency domain."
