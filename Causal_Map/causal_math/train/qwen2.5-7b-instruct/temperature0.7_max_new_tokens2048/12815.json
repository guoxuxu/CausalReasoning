  "Problem": "Imagine a scenario in which a heat distribution in a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) represents the temperature, \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant, and subscripts denote partial derivatives. We explore the implications of an initial condition changed by a function \\\\( f(x) = u(x, 0) e^{\\lambda x} \\\\), where \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), can we accurately determine what specific interventions were applied at intermediate points (whether \\\\( f(x) \\\\), \\\\( g(x) \\\\), or both) by only analyzing the state at time T?",
  "Explanation": "The terminal state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) can result from various combinations of initial and intermediate interventions due to the linearity and superposition principle in the heat equation. This makes it impossible to uniquely determine whether the modifications were due to \\\\( f(x) \\\\), \\\\( g(x) \\\\), or a combination of both without additional information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition function f(x) directly influences the initial temperature distribution u(x, 0), which in turn directly influences the temperature distribution u(x, T) at a later time T."
