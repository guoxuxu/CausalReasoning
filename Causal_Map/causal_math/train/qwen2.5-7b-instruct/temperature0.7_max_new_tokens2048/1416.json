  "Problem": "Consider a system subject to periodic external force, modeled by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + p\\\\dot{x} + qx = f(t)\\\\) where p and q are constants and \\\\(f(t)\\\\) represents the forcing term. We examine the effect of applying a transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(x) = Ax^2 \\\\) to the state x, where A is a constant.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can it be inferred with certainty which transformations (\\\\( g(x) \\\\), \\\\( h(x) \\\\), or both) were initially applied, just by observing \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specifically which transformations were applied based solely on the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is generally impossible due to the non-linearity introduced by the transformations and potential similarities in the resultant states from different initial applications. Without additional constraints or information, the final state can be reached from varying initial transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An external force f(t) influences the state x over time, and the final state x(T) is the result of this influence. Applying the transformation g(x) = Ax^2 to x changes x, but knowing x(T) alone does not allow inferring with certainty whether g(x) was applied, h(x) was applied, or both were applied."
