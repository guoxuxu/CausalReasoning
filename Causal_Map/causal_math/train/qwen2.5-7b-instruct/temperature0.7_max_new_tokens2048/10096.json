  "Problem": "Consider a heat equation \\\\(u_t = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta u\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\kappa\\\\) is the heat conductivity coefficient, and \\\\(\\\\Delta\\\\) is the Laplacian operator. Let's analyze the introduction of an external heat source \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\), which varies over time and space, via the modification of the equation to \\\\(u_t = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta u + h(x, t)\\\\).\n\nFrom knowing only the end temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) can we uniquely determine the specific times and nature (both \\\\(\\\\kappa\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\kappa'\\\\) values) of any conductivity interventions and the exact form of the heat source \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\) used?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of conductivity changes and heat source applications might yield the same final temperature distribution, leading to non-unique inferences about intervention timings and characteristics based solely on the endpoint distribution.",
