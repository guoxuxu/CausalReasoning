  "Problem": "Assess the impact of applying a matrix transformation defined as \\\\( g(x) = P^{-1}APx \\\\) to a vector spacetransformed using the base vector change matrix \\\\( P \\\\), and then evolving this system under a linear transformation \\\\( x' = Bx \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constant matrices and represent different transformations.\n\nIf an intervention altering the evolution rule to \\\\( x' = Dx \\\\) (where \\\\( D \\\\) is another constant matrix) is applied at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of transformations \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( P \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The impact of the earlier change of basis and transformation under \\\\( A \\\\) via \\\\( g(x) \\\\) still influences the state at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), and hence, the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) will depend on both the initial operations via \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( P \\\\), and the subsequent transformation by \\\\( D \\\\). Each transformation interplays to shape the final state through compositional effects.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation P^{-1}APx directly causes the transformed_vector, which then directly causes the evolved_state. The evolution rule x' = Bx directly causes the evolved_state, and if changed to x' = Dx, it also directly causes the evolved_state."
