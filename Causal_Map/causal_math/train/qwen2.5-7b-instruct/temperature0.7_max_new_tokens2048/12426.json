  "Problem": "Given the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant and \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit, we examine the effects of an integral transformation defined by \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt \\), where \\( s \\) is a complex parameter.\n\nIf a modification \\( \\hat{z}(t) = e^{kt}z(t) \\) (where \\( k \\) is a real number) is applied at time \\( t = 0 \\) and \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{\\hat{z}(t)\\} \\) is evaluated, will the resulting transformation depend only on the original \\( \\omega \\) and not \\( k \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by multiplying \\( z(t) \\) with \\( e^{kt} \\) alters the function to \\( \\hat{z}(t) = e^{(i\\omega + k)t} \\), changing the Laplace transform to \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{\\hat{z}(t)\\} = \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega - k} \\). Therefore, the transformed result is dependent on both \\( \\omega \\) and \\( k \\), affecting the outcome.",
