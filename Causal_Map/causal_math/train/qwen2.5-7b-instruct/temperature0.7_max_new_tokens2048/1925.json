  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where D is a diffusion coefficient. An integral transformation \\\\( T(v) = \\\\int e^{-sx} v(x) \\\\, dx \\\\) is applied to investigate the behavior of \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( T(v) \\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under the differential equation without further action, will the transformed solution at time \\\\( T \\\\) be identical to directly evolving \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) under the differential equation and then applying \\\\( T(v) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The linearity and commutative properties of the differential operator and the integral transformation allow applying the transform to the initial condition or after evolving the function to yield the same result. This follows from the properties of linear operators and transforms under the given partial differential equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the integral transformation T(v) to the initial condition u(x, 0) and allowing it to evolve under the differential equation results in a transformed solution at time T that is equivalent to transforming the solution u(x, T) directly evolved from u(x, 0) under the differential equation."
