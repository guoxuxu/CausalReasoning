  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(A+iB)t} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are real numbers and represent the real and imaginary components of the exponent, respectively. The transformation is studied in the context of its Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is defined at t = 0 and subsequently allowed to evolve naturally without any external manipulation, will the Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) at \\\\( \\\\omega = A \\\\) be zero?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(A+iB)t} \\\\) has a Fourier Transform that is a delta function centered at \\\\( \\\\omega = B \\\\). Since \\\\( \\\\omega = A \\\\) does not equal \\\\( B \\\\) assuming \\\\( A \\\\neq B \\\\), the Fourier Transform at \\\\( \\\\omega = A \\\\) is not affected directly by the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under its defined conditions without intervention.",
