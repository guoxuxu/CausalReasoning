  "Problem": "Analyze a continuous-time linear system controlled by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\) where M is a constant matrix. Consider the application of the Laplace transform on the function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Nx} \\\\), where N is another constant matrix, and study its effects over time.\n\nFrom observing the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine the initial configuration \\\\( x_0 \\\\), unaware whether the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge about the application of \\\\( h(x) \\\\), determining the initial state directly from the end state is nontrivial. The potential changes caused by \\\\( e^{Nx} \\\\) could vary in transformation effects, significantly altering the trajectory starting points uniquely.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The matrix M directly causes the rate of change of x over time (dx/dt). The matrix N directly causes the function h(x) which transforms x. The state x at time T (x(T)) directly causes the initial configuration x_0 (assuming no transformation applied). Transformation h(x) directly causes the state x at time T (x(T))."
