  "Problem": "Analyze a linear time-invariant system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Lx\\\\), where L is a matrix representing the system's dynamics. We consider the effect of introducing a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) to the initial state, which alters the state's frequency components.\n\nIf a corrective linear transformation \\\\(H\\\\), another matrix, is applied at some time \\\\(t_1\\\\) post original transform, will the state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the initial application of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) and not on the properties of H?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\(H\\\\) as a corrective measure adds another layer of transformation, thereby making the final state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) dependent on both the effects of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) and the actions of \\\\(H\\\\). This intervention modifies the trajectory and hence the final state, depending on how H interacts with the evolved components of the Fourier-transformed state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The system dynamics L determine the state x(T) at any time T. The Fourier transform F and the corrective transformation H both influence the state x(t_1) at time t_1, but once the state evolves past t_1, it depends only on the dynamics L and not on F or H."
