  "Problem": "Examine the impact of a Fourier transform on the system governed by the partial differential equation describing heat conduction \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\kappa \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) represents temperature distribution along a rod and \\\\(\\\\kappa\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. The Fourier transform of \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) with respect to space is defined as \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx} u(x,t) dx\\\\).\n\nGiven the final Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\), is it feasible to distinguish whether the alteration in the system was due to natural evolution under the heat equation or due to the added function \\\\( g(x, t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of additional spectral components in \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) due to \\\\( g(x, t) \\\\) makes it unclear whether changes are solely due to the native heat diffusion equation or to the intervention, especially without explicit information about intervention's nature and magnitude.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The temperature distribution u(x, t) directly causes changes in its time derivative ∂u/∂t and spatial second derivative ∂²u/∂x²; the Fourier transform of u(x, t) with respect to space directly causes the transformed function u(k, t); an additional function g(x, t) directly causes changes in the time derivative of u(x, t)."
