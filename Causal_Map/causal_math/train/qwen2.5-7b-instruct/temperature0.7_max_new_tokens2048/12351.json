  "Problem": "Let's consider a functional transformation subject to the Laplace Transform (\\\\( L \\\\)) and Inverse Laplace Transform (\\\\( L^{-1} \\\\)) when applied to an ordinary differential equation (ODE) \\\\( y'' + py' + qy = 0 \\\\\\\\, where \\\\( p \\\\) and \\\\( q \\\\) are constants.\n\nCan we identify precisely what interventions (e.g., variable substitution in the Laplace domain) were made by only analyzing the final solution obtained after applying the Inverse Laplace Transform?",
  "Explanation": "The final solution in the time domain can often satisfy multiple differential equations or reflect various interventions in the transformation stage, due to the way different parameters can influence the systems in similarly resulting behaviors. Without additional information about the transformations or interventions applied in the Laplace domain, identifying them solely from the final solution is ambiguous.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace Transform (L) of an ODE transforms it into a simpler algebraic equation, which can then be solved for the transformed solution. Applying the Inverse Laplace Transform (L^{-1}) to this solution yields the final solution in the time domain."
