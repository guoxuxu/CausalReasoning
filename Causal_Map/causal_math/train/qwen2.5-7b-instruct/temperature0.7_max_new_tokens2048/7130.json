  "Problem": "Consider the impact of a linear transformation \\\\( T(x) = Mx \\\\) on a vector space, where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant matrix. Further, analyze how the Fourier transform affects the signal when represented as \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int e^{-2\\\\pi ist}x(t) dt \\\\). We examine the transformation sequences and their reversibility in different intervention scenarios.\n\nCan you infer the original vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\) directly by knowing the result of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) from \\\\( Mx(t) \\\\) without having details of \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing only \\\\( F(s) \\\\) from the transformed data provides no direct way to uniquely reconstruct \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without additional information about \\\\( M \\\\), especially if \\\\( M \\\\) is not invertible or its effect on the frequency domain isn't uniquely determinable.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The Fourier transform F(s) of a signal x(t) is influenced by the linear transformation Mx(t), but knowing F(s) alone does not allow for direct inference of x(t) without knowledge of M."
