  "Problem": "Consider an electrical network where the voltage across a circuit element is governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( V(s) = H(s)I(s) \\\\), where \\\\( H(s) \\\\) represents the complex impedance of the element and \\\\( I(s) \\\\) is the transformed input current. The effect of an intervention by adding a parallel impedance \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) to the system is studied.\n\nIf the transformed input current \\\\( I(s) \\\\) is changed at time 0 without other interventions, will the resulting voltage \\\\( V(s) \\\\) solely depend on the original complex impedance \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Prior to intervention by adding \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), the voltage \\\\( V(s) \\\\) across the element depends solely on the predefined function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and the input current \\\\( I(s) \\\\). Changing \\\\( I(s) \\\\) will modify \\\\( V(s) \\\\) based solely on the existing impedance \\\\( H(s) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
