  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a linear transformation over complex functions, where the input function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed via a convolution with a kernel \\\\( K(t) \\\\), resulting in output \\\\( y(t) = (K * z)(t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty K(t-\\\\tau)z(\\\\tau)d\\\\tau \\\\). The impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to both the kernel and the input function is considered.\n\nKnowing the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we uniquely determine whether a Fourier or Laplace transform, or both, were applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) or \\\\( K(t) \\\\), especially considering an intervention occurred?",
  "Explanation": "Due to potential overlaps and interactions between the effects of Fourier and Laplace transforms on the convolution output, and the non-trivial inverse problem of deconvolution, it is challenging to specify exactly which transformations were applied or their order based solely on the output data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "z(t) → y(t); K(t) → y(t); Fourier(K(t)) → y(t); Fourier(z(t)) → y(t); Laplace(K(t)) → y(t); Laplace(z(t)) → y(t)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input function z(t) and the kernel K(t) directly cause the output y(t) through convolution. Applying either the Fourier transform to K(t) or z(t), or the Laplace transform to K(t) or z(t), indirectly influences y(t) by altering the form of K(t) or z(t) before convolution."
