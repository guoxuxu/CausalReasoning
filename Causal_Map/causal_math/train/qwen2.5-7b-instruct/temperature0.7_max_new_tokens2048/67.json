  "Problem": "Consider a differential equation governing heat distribution \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\), with initial heat distribution function \\\\(u(x, 0) = f(x)\\\\). An operation \\\\(g(u) = e^{wt}u\\\\) is applied, where \\\\(w\\) is a constant, which alters the heat distribution dynamically.\n\nIf an additional operation \\\\(h(u) = e^{-wt}u\\\\) is applied at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the heat distribution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) depend solely on the initial heat equation dynamics and not on the transformations applied (\\\\(g(u)\\\\) or \\\\(h(u)\\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "The subsequent application of \\\\(h(u) = e^{-wt}u\\\\) further alters the trajectory initiated by \\\\(g(u)\\\\). The modifications due to \\\\(g(u)\\\\) and \\\\(h(u)\\\\) collectively influence the evolution of the distribution, making it dependent on all transformations and not just the original heat dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The heat distribution u(x, t) is influenced by the initial condition u(x, 0) and the diffusion process u_t → u. The operations g(u) and h(u) temporarily alter u but do not affect the long-term heat distribution u(x, T) for T > t_1."
