  "Problem": "Let's consider a linear system governed by the matrix equation \\\\( dx/dt = Lx \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear operator. We examine the system's behavior under the Fourier transform defined by \\\\( F(x(t)) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty x(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nCan we recover the exact original function \\\\( x(0) \\\\) after evolving it under \\\\( L \\\\) and observing its Fourier transform \\\\( F(x(\\Omega)) \\\\) without knowing the details of the transformation applied?",
  "Explanation": "Recovering the original function from its transformed state under these conditions is highly uncertain without specific knowledge about the linear transformations \\\\( L \\\\) and the initial application of the Fourier transform. The evolution under \\\\( L \\\\) could affect various frequencies differently, complicating the back-calculation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The linear operator L influences the function x(t), which in turn determines its Fourier transform F(x(t)). Knowing F(x(Ω)) allows us to infer x(0) without needing the explicit details of L."
