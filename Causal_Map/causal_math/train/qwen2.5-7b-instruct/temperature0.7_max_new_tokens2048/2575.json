  "Problem": "Consider the time evolution of a quantum state in the presence of a magnetic field. Let the system be described by the Schrödinger equation \\\\( i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{d\\\\psi}{dt} = H\\\\psi \\\\), where H is the Hamiltonian of the system affected by the magnetic field B, given as \\\\( H = -\\\\gamma \\\\vec{B} \\\\cdot \\\\vec{S} \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) being the gyromagnetic ratio and \\\\( \\\\vec{S} \\\\) the spin operator. The transformation \\\\( f(\\\\psi) = e^{-i\\\\theta S_z} \\\\psi \\\\) represents a rotation around the z-axis by an angle \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(\\\\psi) = e^{-i\\\\phi S_y} \\\\psi \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) is a rotation angle around the y-axis) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on H and not on \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions with \\\\( g(\\\\psi) \\\\) and previously with \\\\( f(\\\\psi) \\\\) alter the state's evolution by affecting its orientation relative to the magnetic field's direction. Thus, the final state \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\) depends critically on both angles \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\), as well as the Hamiltonian H, due to their effects on the state's alignment and phase.",
