  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing scenario involving a sequence of functions \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and its transformations. The Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{x(t)\\\\}(s)\\\\) and a convolution operation with an impulse response \\\\(h(t)\\\\) are used. Analyze the impact of the convolution \\\\(y(t) = x(t) * h(t)\\\\) on the transformed signal over frequency domain \\\\(s\\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed output \\\\(Z(s)\\\\) after multiple operations, can we precisely backtrack to identify whether the operations included convolution with \\\\(h(t)\\\\), filtering with \\\\(g(t)\\\\), or both?",
  "Explanation": "Reversely identifying the specific operations from \\\\(Z(s)\\\\) is typically not feasible without distinct characteristics or additional information about \\\\(g(t)\\\\) and \\\\(h(t)\\\\). Multiple operation sequences can yield the same frequency domain representation, making it challenging to deduce the exact process steps or their order.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The input signal x(t) and the impulse response h(t) together cause the transformed signal Z(s) in the frequency domain. Similarly, the filter response g(t) also causes Z(s)."
