  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. We investigate the impact of applying a Fourier transform, represented by the function \\\\( F(u) \\\\), to the function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) and how this affects the behavior over time.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at time T, can we conclusively determine if \\\\( F(u) \\\\) was applied initially without knowing the specifics of the operator \\\\( L \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the operator \\\\( L \\\\) and how it interacts with transformed initial conditions, it's challenging to trace back and definitively state whether \\\\( F(u) \\\\) was applied. The transformation could yield a similar state at time T under different operational characteristics of \\\\( L \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Fourier transform F(u) to the function u(x, t) changes its representation, while the linear differential operator L governs the temporal change of u(x, t). The application of F(u) before time T influences the observed u(x, T), and without knowledge of L, it's not possible to conclusively determine if F(u) was applied based solely on u(x, T)."
