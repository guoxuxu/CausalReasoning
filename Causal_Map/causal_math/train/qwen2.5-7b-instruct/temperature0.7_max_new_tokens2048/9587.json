  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex-differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + Az\\\\) where \\\\(z\\\\) is a complex function, \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant, and A is a constant matrix. We explore the impact of an integral transform \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Bs}z(s) ds \\\\), where B is a constant matrix, over different times t.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^{t_1} e^{Cs}z(s) ds \\\\) (where C is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\) and A, not B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) as an intervention introduces additional dynamics, making the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent not just on \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\) and A but also the effects of B and C. The transform states and the combined influence of these matrices modify the trajectory leading up to time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z at time T depends on the differential equations governing its change (iωz and Az) and the initial conditions and integrals up to t1 (f(z) and g(z)), but after t1, only iω and A influence z(T)."
