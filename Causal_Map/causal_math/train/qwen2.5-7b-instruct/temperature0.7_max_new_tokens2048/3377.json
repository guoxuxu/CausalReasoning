  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}x(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent real function and \\\\( w \\\\) is a constant frequency. We explore the influence of this transformation where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is a complex function having both amplitude modulation and phase shift properties based on the parameter \\\\( w \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}x(t) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is permitted to evolve under its original dependency on \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without any intervention, will the form of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) exactly track the form of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from t = 0 to T under the same conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation introduces a phase rotation by \\\\( wt \\\\), which distorts the original behavior of \\\\( x(t) \\\\). Even if \\\\( x(t) \\\\) follows a simple path, the multiplication by \\\\( e^{iwt} \\\\) modifies both the phase and amplitude, resulting in a trajectory that does not simply mirror \\\\( x(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
