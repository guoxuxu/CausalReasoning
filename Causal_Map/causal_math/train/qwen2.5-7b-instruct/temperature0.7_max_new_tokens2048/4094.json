  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is an operator. We examine the behavior under the Fourier transformation \\\\( F(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega x} u(x, t) dx \\\\).\n\nAfter observing the transformed system state \\\\( F(u(x,T)) \\\\) at time T, can we uniquely determine the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) without knowing whether a Fourier transform was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Fourier transform is invertible and preserves all necessary information about the function, we can uniquely determine \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) by inverting \\\\( F(u(x,T)) \\\\), regardless of the prior application of the Fourier transform.",
