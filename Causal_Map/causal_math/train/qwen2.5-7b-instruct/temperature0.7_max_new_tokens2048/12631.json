  "Problem": "Consider the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax \\\\) governing a system, where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix. A Fourier transform \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}x(t) dt \\\\) is applied to transform the function over time.\n\nGiven the Fourier transformation result \\\\( F(T) \\\\), can we determine exactly what operations or interventions were made on \\\\( x(t) \\\\) during the evolution from 0 to T?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform aggregates the information in a non-reversible way, especially when interventions alter the state in a non-trivial manner. Without additional constraints or information about the nature of operations (e.g., values of \\\\( B \\\\)), pinpointing exact interventions from \\\\( F(T) \\\\) is not feasible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
