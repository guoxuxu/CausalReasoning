  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) where \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) are solutions to the differential equations \\( \\dot{x} = Ax \\) and \\( \\dot{y} = By \\) respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. We analyze the impact of a Fourier transform on \\( z(t) \\), defined by \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z\\}(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-ist}z(t) dt \\).\n\nIf an additional function \\( h(t) \\) is applied to \\( z(t) \\) before computing \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z\\}(s) \\), such as \\( \\tilde{z}(t) = h(t)z(t) \\), will the result of the Fourier transform depend solely on A and B?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the function \\( h(t) \\) modifies \\( z(t) \\) before the Fourier transform, changing the nature and distribution of frequency components in \\( \\tilde{z}(t) \\). Therefore, the Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{\\tilde{z}\\}(s) \\) will reflect characteristics of \\( h(t) \\) in addition to the impacts of A and B, making the results dependent on more factors than just A and B.",
