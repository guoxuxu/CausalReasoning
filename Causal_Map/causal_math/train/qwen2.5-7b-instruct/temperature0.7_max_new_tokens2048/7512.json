  "Problem": "Analyze the effects of a function \\( h(z) = e^{i\\omega t}z \\) on a complex variable \\( z \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = kz \\), where \\( k \\) is a complex constant, and \\( \\omega \\) is a real number representing angular frequency.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\( z(T) \\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\( h(z) \\), \\( j(z) \\), or both), merely by knowing the value of \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\( z(T) \\) might be achieved from different combinations and timings of interventions due to the nature of exponential multiplication and phases in the complex plane. Without more specific information about the evolution timeline and transformations, the particular interventions cannot be precisely identified from \\( z(T) \\) alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
