  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. The function transforms according to another complex function \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\), applied at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\). The system's development is examined over time under the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\), and the results are compared to an untransformed approach.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 = e^{i0} \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), and then allowed to change naturally without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) had evolved to \\\\( t = T \\\\) without applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) changes the initial form from \\\\( e^{i0} \\\\) to \\\\( e^{i0}^2 = 1^2 = 1 \\\\). Without this transformation, \\\\( z(t) \\\\) will evolve as \\\\( e^{iT} \\\\), which generally differs remarkably for most values of T from the result \\\\( 1 \\\\) obtained after applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\).",
