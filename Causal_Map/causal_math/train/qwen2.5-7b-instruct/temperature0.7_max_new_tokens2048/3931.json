  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature of an object (T) varies in time and can be modeled by the function \\\\( T(x, t) = u(x) + v(x,t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(x) \\\\) is the initial temperature profile and \\\\( v(x,t) \\\\) represents the effect of external forces changing the temperature over time t. Suppose the effect of an external force is described by the integral transform \\\\( v(x,t) = \\int_0^t e^{A(t-s)} f(s) ds \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and f(t) varies non-linearly with time.\n\nIf we intervene by altering the external forces through another nonlinear function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) at time t=5, will the temperature \\\\( T(x,T) \\\\) for T>5 depend solely on the initial profile \\\\( u(x) \\\\) and not on \\\\( f(t) \\\\) or \\\\( g(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(t) \\\\) adds additional complexity to the external forces, affecting the temperature profile. Since both \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\) interact through their respective impacts folded into the integral transform, \\\\( T(x,T) \\\\) will be affected by both, aside from just the initial profile.",
