  "Problem": "Examine the effect of integrating a complex function using different contours in the complex plane. We consider the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{e^{z^2}}{z - a} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( z \\\\) varies over different contours.\n\nIf we integrate \\\\( f(z) \\\\) over a closed contour that does not enclose \\\\( a \\\\), will the result still be zero due to Cauchy's integral theorem?",
  "Explanation": "Cauchy’s integral theorem states that the integral of a holomorphic function over a closed curve that does not enclose any singularity (like \\\\( a \\\\) in this case) is zero. The function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{e^{z^2}}{z - a} \\\\) is holomorphic except at \\\\( z = a \\\\), and if the contour does not enclose \\\\( a \\\\), the integral will indeed be zero.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
