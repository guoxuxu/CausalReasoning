  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the wave function \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t)\\\\) evolves according to the Schrödinger equation with a potential \\\\(V(x)\\\\). The impact of a Fourier transform on the wave function is studied to see how it affects the system's evolution.\n\nCan we infer the original wave function \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t = 0)\\\\) after observing \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t = T)\\\\) without knowing whether a Fourier transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Regardless of whether the Fourier transform was applied initially, the linearity and time-reversibility of the Schrödinger equation and the invertibility of the Fourier transform allow the reconstruction of \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t = 0)\\\\) from \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t = T)\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The potential V(x) influences the wave function ψ(x, t), which in turn evolves from ψ(x, t = 0) over time. A Fourier transform can alter the wave function ψ(x, t)."
