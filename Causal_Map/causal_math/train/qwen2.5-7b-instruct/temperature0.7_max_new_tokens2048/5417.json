  "Problem": "Consider a complex function z(t) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az + B\\\\overline{z}\\\\), where A and B are constants and \\\\(\\\\overline{z}\\\\) represents the complex conjugate of z. We explore the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is also a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve according to the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az + B\\\\overline{z}\\\\) without further intervention, will the value of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be equal to what it would have been if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was evolved directly under the same differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) modifies the initial condition in a manner dependent on C. Since the differential equation involves non-linear interactions between z and its complex conjugate, the initial modification can significantly alter the trajectory and the resulting state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation f(z) = e^(Ct)z applied to z_0 at t=0 changes z's behavior over time such that A and B in the differential equation dz/dt = Az + B\\overline{z} directly cause the evolution of z(t) leading to z(T). Without f(z), z_0 evolves differently under the same differential equation, potentially resulting in a different z(T)."
