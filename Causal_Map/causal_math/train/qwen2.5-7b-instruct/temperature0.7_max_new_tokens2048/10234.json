  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t is time. We explore how different transformations influence this function, specifically transformations \\\\( T_1(z) = e^z \\\\) and \\\\( T_2(z) = z^2 \\\\), applied at different times.\n\nGiven observation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time t = T, can we deduce whether \\\\( T_1(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0 without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if \\\\( T_1(z) \\\\) was applied, the observed state can result from various potentials, like different initial conditions or natural evolutions. The form and properties of \\\\( e^{e^{it}} \\\\) differ significantly from simply \\\\( e^{it} \\\\), making it challenging to discern the presence of \\\\( T_1 \\\\) transformation retrospectively.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
