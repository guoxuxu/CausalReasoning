  "Problem": "Consider a linear space of functions where the kernel operator K is defined on a function y(x). The relationship between y and its image under K is described through a convolution, i.e., \\\\( K*y = \\\\int h(t) y(x-t) dt \\\\), where h(t) is an impulse response function. We are interested in how the application of Fourier Transform (\\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\)) might influence this relationship.\n\nGiven the Fourier Transform of the convolution result \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(K*y) \\\\), can we uniquely recover the function \\\\( y(x) \\\\) without prior knowledge on the usage of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The recovery of \\\\( y(x) \\\\) from \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(K*y) \\\\) requires knowledge of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(h) \\\\). Without information on whether \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) or another operation altered \\\\( y(x) \\\\), and the particular form of h(t), the original function y cannot be uniquely determined.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The impulse response function h(t) determines the convolution K*y, the Fourier Transform of K*y provides information about the frequency content which can be used to potentially recover y(x) if h(t) is known and invertible."
