  "Problem": "Consider a reaction-diffusion system expressed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\Delta u + k(u)\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\Delta\\\\) is the Laplacian operator and \\\\(k(u)\\\\) is a nonlinear function of u. We study the effects of applying a Laplace transformation \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) over the spatial variable x.\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) is transformed by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) and is used to evolve the system according to the given PDE, will the transformed state \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}u(x,T)\\\\) at time T be identical to applying \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) after evolving \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) up to time T under the original conditions?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) initially modifies the spectrum of the initial condition. The evolution of this transformed condition under the PDE with diffusion and a nonlinear term can result in a different redistribution of energy across modes compared to transforming after the evolution. The nonlinearity and the diffusion influence the new distribution differently.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u(x,0) directly causes the evolved state u(x,T) through the Laplace transformation L; applying L to u(x,0) before evolution leads to a state L[u(x,T)], which is equivalent to applying L to the evolved state u(x,T) directly."
