  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = h(x, y) = x^3 + iy^2 \\\\) in the complex domain, where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are real numbers. Analyzing this as a complex function involves studying transformations such as \\\\( z \\\\) undergoing a rotation and a stretching described by \\\\( g(z) = e^{At}z \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what transformations were used (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( f(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could potentially result from various transformations and combinations thereof, considering the nonlinear and complex nature of the transformations involved. The ambiguity and complexity of the effects induced by the transformations make it challenging to uniquely identify the sequence or types of interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
