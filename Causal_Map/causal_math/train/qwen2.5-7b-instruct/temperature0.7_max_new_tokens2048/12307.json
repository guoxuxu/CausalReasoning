  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system where \\\\(z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0\\\\), representing a rotation in the complex plane, with A being a real constant. We explore how the function \\\\(f(z) = e^{iBt}z\\\\), where B is another real constant, affects this system over time t.\n\nCan we precisely identify which transformations (\\\\(f(z)\\\\), \\\\(g(z)\\\\), or both) were applied by only observing the system's final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of transformations and their timings (B and C values) could potentially lead to the same final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\), due to the rotational symmetries and the possibility of overlaps in the outcomes generated by different sequence of transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
