  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{ f(t) \\\\}(s) = F(s)\\\\). We evaluate how a convolution with a function \\\\( g(t) = e^{-at} \\\\) (where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real constant) impacts the transform at a later time \\\\( T \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( g(t) \\\\) to \\\\( h(t) = e^{-bt} \\\\) at some intermediate time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), will the final Laplace transform still simply be \\\\( G(s) = F(s + a) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the convolution function to \\\\( h(t) \\\\), thereby changing the resulting Laplace transform to \\\\( H(s) = F(s + b) \\\\). This modifies the outcome from what would have been just with \\\\( g(t) \\\\) alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function g(t) = e^(-at) influences F(s) through the Laplace transform, and similarly, h(t) = e^(-bt) does so as well. An intervention changing g(t) to h(t) at time t1 < T affects F(s) at time T via the modified function."
