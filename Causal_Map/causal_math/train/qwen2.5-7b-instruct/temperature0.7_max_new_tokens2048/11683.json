  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model in which the flow (\\\\( f(x) \\\\)) through a nonlinear system is described by a complex function \\\\( f(x) = e^{iz} \\\\), where \\\\( z = Ax + B \\\\), and A, B are matrices. We examine the impact of an integral transformation applied to \\\\( f(x) \\\\): (\\\\( T[g(x)] = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-ixt} g(x) dx \\\\)), for a function \\\\( g(x) \\\\).\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( H(x) = x^2 \\\\) is applied at a certain time during the transformation process, will the final result of \\\\( T[f(x)] \\\\) at the end of all transformations depend only on the original function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and not on the interventions?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( H(x) = x^2 \\\\) introduces an additional nonlinear modification to the system which affects both the magnitude and phase characteristics of \\\\( g(x) \\\\). Thus, the final output will reflect changes due to both the original and intervened transformations, making the result dependent on the introduced functions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
