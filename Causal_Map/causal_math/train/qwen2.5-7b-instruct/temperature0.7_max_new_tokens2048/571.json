  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow through a variable area duct governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dQ}{dx} = -a(x)Q \\\\), where \\\\( Q \\\\) represents the flow rate and \\\\( a(x) \\\\) is a variable coefficient dependent on the position \\\\( x \\\\). We analyze the impact of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(Q) = e^{Bx}Q \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf at a certain position \\\\( x_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(Q) = e^{Cx}Q \\\\) (where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the flow rate \\\\( Q(X) \\\\) for X > x_1 depend only on \\\\( a(x) \\\\) and not on \\\\( B \\\\) or \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(Q) \\\\) introduces additional dynamics affecting the flow rate. Consequently, the final state \\\\( Q(X) \\\\) depends not only on the function \\\\( a(x) \\\\) but also on the effects of \\\\( e^{Bx} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Cx} \\\\), which alter the flow rate at different sections of the duct.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The flow rate Q changes due to the variable coefficient a(x), and this change is reflected in the derivative dQ/dx. Applying the functions f(Q) and g(Q) does not alter the dependency of Q on a(x) for X > x_1."
