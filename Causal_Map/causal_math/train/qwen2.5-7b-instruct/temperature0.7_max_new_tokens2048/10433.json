  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u + iv \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z + cz^2 \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\) are constants. We explore the behavior when subjected to an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s}z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from the initial condition \\\\( z(0) = z_0 \\\\), and then the function is allowed to evolve under the given differential equation without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for some T > t be the same as if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was evolved from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under the differential equation alone?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) integrates the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) with a decaying exponential which modifies its original path. The alteration of the integral path changes the conditions under which the differential equation operates, thus affecting the function at any subsequent time T.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial value z(0) directly influences z(t) through the differential equation, and T(z) transforms z(t) over time. Constants ω and c also directly cause changes in dz/dt. The evolution of z(t) under the differential equation determines z(T), which may differ from the direct evolution from z(0) without the integral transformation."
