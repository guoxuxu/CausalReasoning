  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We explore the impact of applying a Fourier transform to this function, represented as \\\\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\} \\), which converts it from the time domain to the frequency domain.\n\nGiven the frequency domain representation \\\\( \\delta(\\xi - \\omega) \\\\), is it possible to exactly reconstruct the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) as \\\\( e^{i \\omega t} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Fourier transform of \\\\( \\delta(\\xi - \\omega) \\\\) precisely recovers the original function \\\\( e^{i \\omega t} \\\\). The delta function in the frequency domain specifies a single, unambiguous frequency component, allowing for exact reconstruction of the time-domain signal.",
