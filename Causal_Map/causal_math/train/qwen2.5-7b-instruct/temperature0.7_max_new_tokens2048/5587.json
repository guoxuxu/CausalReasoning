  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( u_t + Au_x = 0 \\\\), where A is a constant coefficient. We analyze the impact of a Fourier transformation \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int e^{-ikx}u(x, t)\\\\, dx \\\\) over time t.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new Fourier transform reflecting a function modification \\\\( g(u) = u + h \\\\), where h is another function of x and t, is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on A?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) is influenced by both the characteristic properties of the differential equation and the modification introduced by \\\\( h \\\\). The addition of \\\\( h \\\\) can alter the wave's characteristics, and thus the effect of A on the system—which solely governs unmodified wave propagation—is no longer isolated in determining the transformed state at T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
