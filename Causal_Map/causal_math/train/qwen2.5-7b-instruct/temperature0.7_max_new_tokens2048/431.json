  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We investigate the effects of applying a transformation defined by \\\\( g(x) = Ux \\\\), where U is an orthogonal matrix, on the solution at different time points.\n\nIf a different transformation \\\\( h(x) = Vx \\\\) (where V is another orthogonal matrix) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on M and not on U or V?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(x) = Vx \\\\) introduces additional transformation dynamics into the system. The final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) will potentially depend on the actions of both U and V transformations as well as the matrix M. The interaction between these matrices, especially if they do not commute, affects the final state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
