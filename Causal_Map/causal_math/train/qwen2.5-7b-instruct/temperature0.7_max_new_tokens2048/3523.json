  "Problem": "A system is controlled by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We assess the effect of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), where D is another constant matrix, on the system's behavior over time t.\n\nIf at some specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another function \\\\( k(z) = e^{Ft}z \\\\) (where F is a constant matrix) is introduced as an intervention, is the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 solely dependent on M and not on D or F?",
  "Explanation": "Implementing an intervention with \\\\( k(z) \\\\) adds an additional layer of complexity, modifying the trajectory and thus making the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on D, F, as well as M. The nature of these matrix transformations means that their effects are compounded and cannot be separated by merely observing the outcome at T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
