  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t, governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. Analyze the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{C\\\\tau}z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to definitively trace back and determine which transformations (\\\\( F(z) \\\\), \\\\( G(z) \\\\) or both) were applied solely by knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can result from multiple possible applications of the transformations \\\\( F(z) \\\\) and \\\\( G(z) \\\\), due to the potential overlapping effects and non-uniqueness in the way the transformations interact with the system. Hence, knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone does not suffice to determine the specific transformations applied.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The values of u(t) and v(t) at time T are determined by the initial conditions and the constants A and B through their respective differential equations. The integral transformation F(z) depends on the function z(τ) over the interval [0, T], which includes the contributions from u(t) and v(t). Knowing z(T) allows tracing back to u(t) and v(t) through their differential equations, but not uniquely to specific transformations F(z) or G(z) without additional information."
