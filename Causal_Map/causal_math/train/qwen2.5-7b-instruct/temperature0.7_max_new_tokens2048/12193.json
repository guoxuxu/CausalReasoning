  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = \\\\Delta u \\\\), where \\\\( u(t,x) \\\\) is the temperature distribution over a domain. We investigate the effect of introducing a source term \\\\( S(x) \\\\) applied from time t = 0, described mathematically as \\\\( u_t = \\\\Delta u + S(x) \\\\).\n\nGiven the temperature distribution \\\\( u(T,x) \\\\) at time T, can we determine whether a source term \\\\( S(x) \\\\) was applied at t = 0 without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Without extra information about the base conditions or the exact characteristics of \\\\( S(x) \\\\), it is challenging to distinguish if the observed temperature distribution at \\\\( u(T,x) \\\\) arose purely due to diffusion or due to the influence of \\\\( S(x) \\\\). The presence of natural fluctuations and boundary effects in \\\\( u(t,x) \\\\) complicates deducing the presence of the source term from the final state alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Introducing a source term S(x) at t=0 affects the temperature distribution u(t,x) through its impact on the time derivative u_t, which in turn influences the spatial distribution Δu."
