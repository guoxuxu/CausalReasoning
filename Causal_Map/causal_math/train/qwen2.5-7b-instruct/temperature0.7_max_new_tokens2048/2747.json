  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on the complex plane \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) and a transformation defined by the integral transform \\\\( g(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-sz} f(z) dz \\\\). Suppose we further investigate how other transformations like multiplication by a complex constant affect this scenario.\n\nIf a transformation \\\\( h(z) = kz \\\\) (where k is a complex constant) is applied to \\\\( f(z) \\\\) before transforming it to \\\\( g(s) \\\\), will the resulting function solely be influenced by the parameter k in terms of change in singularities and their nature?",
  "Explanation": "While the scaling transformation by k affects the nature of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), its impact when computing \\\\( g(s) \\\\) involves an interaction between the original singularities of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and the scaling factor. This interaction makes the resultant transformation depend on both the nature of f and the scaling parameter k.",
