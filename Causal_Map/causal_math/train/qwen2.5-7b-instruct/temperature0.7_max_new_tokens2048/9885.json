  "Problem": "Let \\\\( z(w) \\\\) be a complex function defined as \\\\( z(w) = w^2 + 2iw \\\\), mapped over the complex plane. We are interested in examining the changes in the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C z(w) dw \\\\) where \\\\( C \\\\) is a closed contour in the w-plane, particularly under the transformation \\\\( T(w) = e^{iw}w \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T(w) \\\\) is applied to a variable \\\\( w_0 \\\\) in the contour \\\\( C \\\\) and then \\\\( C \\\\) is evolved under \\\\( z(w) \\\\) without further intervention, will the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C z(w) dw \\\\) change?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( T(w) = e^{iw}w \\\\) changes the nature of the contour \\\\( C \\\\) in the complex plane, which alters the values of \\\\( w \\\\) along \\\\( C \\\\). Since \\\\( z(w) = w^2 + 2iw \\\\) depends explicitly on \\\\( w \\\\), the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C z(w) dw \\\\) will indeed be different as the function values \\\\( z(w) \\\\) are transformed.",
