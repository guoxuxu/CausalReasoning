  "Problem": "We consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\) where L is a linear differential operator. We investigate the effects of applying Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(u(t)) \\\\) to the system, with its inverse transform typically denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\).\n\nCan we conclusively determine which operator governed the system at any time before T, given only the state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) and knowing an intervention might have occurred?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific information about the timing and nature of the intervention, one cannot deduce with certainty the operator (L or M) that was active at any moment before T. Multiple configurations of L, M, and t_1 could lead to the same final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\), particularly if the operators have overlapping spectral properties.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state of u at time t influences its state at time T, L governs the change in u over time, applying the Laplace transform to u results in U(s), and L also affects U(s)."
