  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where a linear time-invariant (LTI) system characterized by its impulse response h(t) is being studied. The signal s(t) is processed, and we analyze the influence of convolution with the impulse response and a Fourier transform applied to the signal.\n\nGiven the signal s(t) is input to an LTI system with impulse response h(t) resulting in output y(t) = s(t) * h(t), if a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is applied to s(t), will the Fourier transform of y(t), \\\\( \\\\hat{y}(\\\\omega) \\\\), be the product of the Fourier transforms of s(t) and h(t) without any intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of a convolution is the product of the Fourier transforms of the operands. Thus, \\\\( \\\\hat{y}(\\\\omega) = \\\\hat{s}(\\\\omega) \\\\cdot \\\\hat{h}(\\\\omega) \\\\), demonstrating that the effect on the output in the frequency domain is a direct multiplication of the transformed inputs, consistent with the convolution theorem.",
