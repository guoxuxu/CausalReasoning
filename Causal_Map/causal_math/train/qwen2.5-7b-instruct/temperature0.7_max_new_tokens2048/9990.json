  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. This function represents an oscillatory behavior in the complex plane. We explore the effect of a transformation \\\\( T(z) = z^n \\\\), where \\\\( n \\\\) is a positive integer, on the function's behavior.\n\nGiven the observed function \\\\( z'(t) = e^{i n \\omega t} \\\\) can we deduce the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied, it is not definitive whether the observed higher frequency \\\\( n \\omega \\\\) comes from an original frequency of \\\\( \\omega \\\\) or another scenario. The observed \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) could correspond to multiple potential original functions with different transformation parameters.",
