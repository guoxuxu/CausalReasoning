  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by the integral equation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(t-s)A}x(s) \\\\, ds \\\\), where A is a constant matrix. We study the effect of applying a transformation \\\\( f(x) = e^{Bt}x(t) \\\\) over time t, where B is another constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) used at t = 0 after observing \\\\( y(T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation applied by \\\\( f(x) \\\\) might have changed \\\\( x(t) \\\\) in a way that impacts the entire future trajectory of the integral. Without knowing the effect of \\\\( B \\\\) or whether it was applied, retracing to the exact \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from \\\\( y(T) \\\\) is obscured, given potential multiple solutions or modifications.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "y(T) is influenced by A and B through the integral equation, and observing y(T) at t=T allows deduction of x(0) if no transformation f(x) = e^(Bt)x(t) is applied."
