  "Problem": "Suppose we have a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that satisfies the integral equation \\\\( z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{A(t-s)} B u(s) \\, ds \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent control function.\n\nIf at time t = t_1 an adjustment \\\\( u(t) = u(t) + v(t) \\\\), where v(t) is another controlled function, is applied, will the system's state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be determined exclusively by the original control function u?",
  "Explanation": "The adjustment by adding v(t) introduces a new component to the control function, changing the integral input to \\\\( e^{A(t-s)} B (u(s) + v(s)) \\\\). This results in a modified state trajectory not solely determined by the original \\\\( u(t) \\\\).",
