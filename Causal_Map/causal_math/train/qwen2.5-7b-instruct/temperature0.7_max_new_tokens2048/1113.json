  "Problem": "Analyze a signal processing system where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed by a Fourier transform, subjected to a filter \\\\( H(s) \\\\), and then converted back using the inverse Fourier transform. Let's denote the output signal as \\\\( y(t) = \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}(H(s) \\\\mathcal{F}(x(t))) \\\\).\n\nIf the signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a sinusoidal function without any initial alteration before applying the Fourier transform, will the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) be solely determined by the filter \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) undergoes a Fourier transform, the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is determined by how the filter \\\\( H(s) \\\\) alters the transformed signal in the frequency domain. The nature of the filter defines the characteristics of the output, assuming no additional interventions modify the signal processing path.",
