  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where the analysis focused on the effect of a complex integration transformation \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{a}^{z} f(w) dw \\\\) on a function \\\\( f(w) \\\\), which is analytic in a domain D. Assume \\\\( a \\\\) is a fixed point within D.\n\nIf the function \\\\( f(w) \\\\) is known, and the transformation \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is applied without any further function manipulation, will the behavior of \\\\( F(z) \\\\) on the boundary of domain D be solely determined by \\\\( f(w) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is an integral of \\\\( f(w) \\\\) from a fixed point to \\\\( z \\\\), its values and behavior are directly determined by the properties and behavior of \\\\( f(w) \\\\). Complex integration is a linear operator, and there are no intervening variables altering \\\\( f \\\\) beyond its given nature in the domain D.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
