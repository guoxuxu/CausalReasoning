  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions and their derivatives are effected by the Laplace Transform. Here, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ u(t) \\\\} = U(s) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ v(t) \\\\} = V(s) \\\\), with s representing the complex frequency domain.\n\nCan the original functions \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) be uniquely determined from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at a future time T without knowing their transformed states U(s) and V(s)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of U(s) and V(s), multiple combinations of u(t) and v(t) could result in the same z(T) due to potential ambiguities in the inverse Laplace Transform, especially if u(t) and v(t) have non-unique or shared frequency components.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The original functions u(t) and v(t) are derived from z(t) through real and imaginary parts respectively, and their Laplace transforms U(s) and V(s) can be used to recover u(t) and v(t) if known."
