  "Problem": "Consider a complex function described by \\\\( g(z) = e^{az^2} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. To analyze the transformations, we introduce the Laplace transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\) applied to a different function resulting from the initial function \\\\( g(z) \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce whether the function \\\\( h(z) = z^a \\\\) was applied or not just by examining the outcome of the Laplace transform of \\\\( f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The overlap in potential Laplace transform results induced by various combinations of powers and exponentials in the complex plane can lead to ambiguity. The properties of the exponential and power functions under transformation could create similar outputs, obscuring the specific intervention applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
