  "Problem": "Consider a periodic signal described by the function \\\\( v(t) = A \\\\sin(\\\\omega t + \\\\phi) \\\\). The signal undergoes various modifications using a linear operator represented by \\\\( L \\\\) that performs a convolution with a kernel \\\\( h(t) \\\\), specifically designed to alter phase and amplitude.\n\nBased on the observed final signal \\\\( u(T) \\\\), can we determine which operations were applied (whether \\\\( L \\\\), \\\\( M \\\\), or both), merely by analyzing the signal characteristics at T?",
  "Explanation": "Given that both \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\) could modify phase, amplitude, and possibly other signal characteristics, determining which specific operations were applied from the final signal form alone is challenging. The convolution effects could overlap, making it impossible to distinguish the contributions solely by final signal analysis.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input signal v(t) is transformed by the linear operator L (which involves convolution with h(t)) to produce the output u(T). Similarly, the input signal v(t) can also be transformed by another operator M to produce the same output u(T) at time T."
