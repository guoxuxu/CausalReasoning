  "Problem": "Assume we are dealing with a circuit system characterized by a linear transformation given by a matrix product \\\\( R = MC \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a matrix representing the Maxwell's equations and \\\\( C \\\\) represents electrical properties of materials like capacitance and resistance.\n\nIf the material properties matrix \\\\( C \\\\) is initially set and then the system evolves under Maxwell's equations without any modification in \\\\( C \\\\), will the system's response represented by matrix \\\\( R \\\\) at some later time be identical to the initial Maxwell's formulated response?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( C \\\\) is constant and the system evolves according to Maxwell's equations without any external intervention, \\\\( R \\\\) retains its initial formulation, reflecting the defined material properties modulated by unchanged Maxwell's dynamics across time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The material properties matrix C and the matrix M (representing Maxwell's equations) directly cause the system's response matrix R. If C remains constant and M does not change, then R will remain unchanged over time."
