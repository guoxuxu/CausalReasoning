  "Problem": "Let us consider a complex function initially defined on the real axis: \\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\), where \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\) are real functions representing components in the complex plane. A transformation \\(f(z) = e^{At}z\\), where A is a complex constant and t is time, is applied.\n\nGiven the complex value \\( z(T) \\), can we uniquely determine which transformations were applied (either \\( f(z) \\), \\( g(z) \\), or both) based only on the outcome?",
  "Explanation": "Different combinations of A and B, or a single application of either, can result in the same \\( z(T) \\) due to the multifaceted influence of complex exponential scaling on the trajectory. Determining specifics of interventions from the endpoint alone is not feasible without additional contextual or sequential information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
