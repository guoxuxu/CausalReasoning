  "Problem": "Consider a Fourier Transform applied to a time-dependent signal modeled as \\\\( x(t) = e^{i\\\\omega_0 t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) is a constant frequency. The transform changes the signal into frequency domain as \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\). We further introduce a modulation by multiplying the transformed signal with a function \\\\( g(\\\\omega) = e^{-\\\\alpha |\\\\omega - \\\\omega_0|} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a decay constant.\n\nIf a compensatory function \\\\( h(\\\\omega) = e^{\\\\alpha |\\\\omega - \\\\omega_0|} \\\\) is applied at some intermediate frequency point after the modulation, will the final transformed signal \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) remain independent of \\\\( g(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the compensatory function \\\\( h(\\\\omega) \\\\) effectively neutralizes the attenuation caused by \\\\( g(\\\\omega) \\\\). This restores the original magnitude of the Fourier components at each frequency, thus making the final signal independent from the initial modulation.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The original signal x(t) transforms into X(ω) via Fourier Transform; multiplying X(ω) by g(ω) results in X'(ω); applying h(ω) to X'(ω) yields X''(ω); h(ω) and g(ω) are inverses, thus X''(ω) remains equivalent to X(ω)."
