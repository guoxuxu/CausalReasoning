  "Problem": "Consider a linear system of equations represented in matrix form as \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), where A is a invertible matrix. We explore the effects of applying a matrix transformation \\\\(T = e^{Mt}\\\\) to the vector \\\\(b\\\\), where \\\\(M\\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\(t\\\\) is a time variable.\n\nIf a new transformation \\\\(S(x) = e^{Nt}x\\\\) (where \\\\(N\\\\) is another constant matrix) is introduced as an intervention after solving \\\\(Ax = e^{Mt}b\\\\), will the result depend exclusively on the matrix \\\\(A\\\\) and not on \\\\(M\\\\) or \\\\(N\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a new transformation \\\\(S(x)\\\\) further alters the vector \\\\(x\\\\) after it has already been modified by \\\\(T(b)\\\\). Therefore, the end result is dependent on all three matrices, \\\\(A\\\\), \\\\(M\\\\), and \\\\(N\\\\), with each contributing to how the vector propagates across transformations and how interactions between \\\\(M\\\\) and \\\\(N\\\\) may impact the resultant vector.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformed vector \\(S(x)\\) depends on the initial solution \\(x\\) which is determined by matrix \\(A\\), and the transformation \\(e^{Mt}\\) applied to \\(b\\). The matrix \\(N\\) used in the subsequent transformation \\(S(x) = e^{Nt}x\\) does not depend on \\(M\\) or \\(A\\), but rather introduces an additional transformation independent of the previous ones."
