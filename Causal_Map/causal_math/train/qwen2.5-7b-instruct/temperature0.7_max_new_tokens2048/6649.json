  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature dynamics in a reactor is controlled by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{T} = k(T_e - T) + S\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a rate constant, \\\\(T_e\\\\) is the external temperature, \\\\(T\\\\) is the reactor temperature, and \\\\(S\\\\) is a source term due to a reaction. The transformation \\\\(f(T) = T^2\\\\) is considered at a time instant to study the impact on the reactor's thermal behavior.\n\nIf \\\\(f(T)\\\\) is applied to the reactor temperature \\\\(T_0\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\), then the system is allowed to evolve according to \\\\(\\\\dot{T} = k(T_e - T) + S\\\\) without further intervention, will the temperature at time \\\\(T(t)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\) be identical to what it would have been if \\\\(T_0\\\\) had not been squared initially?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\(f(T) = T^2\\\\) changes the initial reactor temperature drastically by squaring it, leading to a different starting point for the dynamics described by the differential equation. This different initial condition will affect the entire trajectory of the temperature over time, resulting in a different temperature profile at any subsequent time \\\\(t = T\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial temperature T_0 directly influences the reactor temperature T, which evolves over time according to the differential equation. The external temperature T_e and the source term S also directly cause changes in T. Applying the transformation f(T) = T^2 at t=0 affects the initial condition but does not change the dynamics described by the differential equation, so T(t) at t=T will be different unless T_0 was already such that T^2 did not alter its evolution."
