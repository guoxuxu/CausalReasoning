  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time representing the real and imaginary parts of the complex signal, respectively. Analyze the effects of a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\\\( M = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\\\\\ 2 & 3 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\) on the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t)) \\\\) of the signal.\n\nCan we accurately deduce the initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(T)) \\\\) without knowing if the transformation \\\\( M \\\\) was applied at the start?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the initial application of \\\\( M \\\\), the changes induced by the matrix in the real and imaginary components aren't evident from the final Fourier transform alone. This lack of information prevents the exact back-calculation of \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The matrix M transforms the initial vector z_0 into z(t), which then undergoes a Fourier transform resulting in the Fourier transform of z(t). Observing the Fourier transform of z(T) does not directly allow deducing z_0 without knowledge of M's application."
