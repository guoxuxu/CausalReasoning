  "Problem": "Suppose we have a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t. Assume the dynamic of the function is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), with M being a constant 2x2 real matrix.\n\nIf an initial condition \\\\( z(0) = z_0 \\\\) undergoes evolution defined by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\) for time T, and then the complex transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Mt}z \\\\) is applied, does \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after transformation match \\\\( z(T) \\\\) evolved directly by the differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the transformation and the differential equation are aligned in structure (both involve the same matrix M), applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) after evolving \\\\( z(t) \\\\) will end in the same state as directly evolving \\\\( z(t) \\\\), since \\\\( e^{MT} z_0 \\\\) effectively encapsulates both the transformation and the natural dynamics of the system.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition z(0) directly causes z(T) through the differential equation dz/dt = Mz. The matrix M directly causes the rate of change of z with respect to time. Applying the transformation f(z) = e^(Mt)z to z(T) directly causes z(T) to be transformed."
