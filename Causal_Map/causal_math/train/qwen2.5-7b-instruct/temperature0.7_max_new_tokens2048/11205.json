  "Problem": "In a complex analysis setting, consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency and t represents time. The impact of the integral transformation defined by a convolution integral \\\\( g(t) = (h * z)(t) \\\\) over time t, with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) being another function, is analyzed.\n\nIf the convolution \\\\( g(t) = (h * z)(t) \\\\) is applied initially and allowed to evolve over time without intervention, will the transformed function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) at time T be equivalent to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time T transformed by \\\\( h \\\\) applied at that instant?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution alters the time evolution of the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by integrating effects of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) over the past, leading to different outcomes at time T than a direct application at time T due to the cumulative nature of the convolution.",
