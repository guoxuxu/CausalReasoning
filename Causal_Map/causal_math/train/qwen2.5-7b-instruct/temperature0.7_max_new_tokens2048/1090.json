  "Problem": "Consider a system where the heat distribution over a rod is modeled by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\) with a thermal diffusivity constant k. The Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) is applied as a functional alteration, impacting the system's response to thermal inputs.\n\nAfter observing the thermal distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at time T, can we deduce the original distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) without knowing whether the Fourier Transform was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on whether the Fourier Transform was applied, reconstructing the initial distribution accurately is not feasible. The Fourier Transform could have modified the initial state in a way that impacts backward calculation uniquely, especially since the heat equation's effects in frequency space can vary significantly.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of temperature with respect to time (u_t) directly causes the second derivative of temperature with respect to space (u_xx). Applying the Fourier Transform alters the system's response (altered_u), and observing the thermal distribution at time T (u(x, T)) allows us to infer the original distribution (u(x, 0)), assuming the inverse Fourier Transform is applied."
