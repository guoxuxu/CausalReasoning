  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We explore the effect of the transformation \\\\(h(u) = e^{Mt}u\\\\), where M is another linear differential operator, on the evolution of function u over time t.\n\nIf \\\\(h(u)\\\\) is applied to a function \\\\(u_0\\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(u(t)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\(u_0\\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(h(u)\\\\) at t=0 modifies the initial condition from \\\\(u_0\\\\) to \\\\(e^{Mt}u_0\\\\), and the evolution under L from this altered state is generally different due to the differential properties of L and M, leading to a different state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial function u_0 evolves to u(t) under the differential operator L. Applying the transformation h(u) = e^(Mt)u to u_0 at t=0 results in a new function that also evolves to u(t) under L. The operators M and L interact through the transformation h(u), affecting the evolution of u(t)."
