  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( w(z) = z^2 \\\\) where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. We assess the effects of the integral transformation \\\\( T[f](z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-zt} f(t) dt \\\\), applied to a function \\\\( f(t) = t^k \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a positive integer.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( G[f](z) = \\\\partial^m (T[f](z)) \\\\) (m-th derivative with respect to \\\\( z \\\\)) is applied at a specific time, will the result at \\\\( z \\\\) for \\\\( T[f] \\\\) still only depend on the original \\\\( k \\\\) value?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the derivative as an intervention modifies the resulting function by increasing the negative power of \\\\( z \\\\) and potentially altering coefficients, resulting in dependency not only on \\\\( k \\\\) but also on the degree \\\\( m \\\\) of the derivative applied. The intervention changes the structure of the dependency on \\\\( z \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The original function f(t) determines T[f](z), which in turn influences G[f](z) through its m-th derivative with respect to z. The value of k (the exponent in f(t) = t^k) directly affects T[f](z), and consequently, G[f](z)."
