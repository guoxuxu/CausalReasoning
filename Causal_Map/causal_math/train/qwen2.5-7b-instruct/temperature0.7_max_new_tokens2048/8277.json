  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system where the complex function is \\\\( z(t) = w(t) + iu(t) \\\\), with \\\\( w(t) \\\\) representing the real part and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) the imaginary part governed by \\\\(\\\\dot{w} = Cw\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{u} = Du\\\\), here C and D are constant matrices. Analyze the system after applying the Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(z(t)) = \\\\mathcal{L}(w(t)) + i\\\\mathcal{L}(u(t)) \\\\) and then conducting an inverse transform.\n\nIf the Laplace transform followed by an inverse transform is applied to \\\\( z_0 = w_0 + iu_0 \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{w} = Cw\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{u} = Du\\\\) without further intervention, will the \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the original system?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform followed by the inverse transform is mathematically designed to reconstruct the original function, leaving \\\\( z(t) \\\\) unchanged theoretically. Thus, the system's state at any later time T would follow its intended trajectory had no transformation occurred.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial conditions w(0) and u(0) directly cause the values of w(t) and u(t) respectively over time through the differential equations Cw → w(t) and Du → u(t). These values then combine to determine z(t) = w(t) + iu(t). Applying the Laplace transform followed by an inverse transform does not change the outcome of the system's evolution from t=0 to t=T under the given differential equations."
