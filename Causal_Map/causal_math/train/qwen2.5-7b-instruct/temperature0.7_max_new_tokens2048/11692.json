  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where a function's domain and range are controlled by differential equations \\\\(dx/dt = Px\\\\) and \\\\(dy/dt = Qy\\\\), where P and Q are constant matrices. We investigate the effects of applying an integral transformation \\\\(T[x(t)] = \\\\int_0^t e^{Rs}x(s) ds\\\\) on x(t), where R is a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the end state x(T), can we determine precisely what operations were used (whether \\\\(T[x(t)]\\\\), \\\\(U[x(t)]\\\\), or both), merely by knowing the state at x(T)?",
  "Explanation": "Different combinations of the operations \\\\(T[x(t)]\\\\) and \\\\(U[x(t)]\\\\), alongside their interacting matrices R and M, could lead to the same state x(T). Since these operations involve nontrivial matrix exponential effects and integration, it is not possible to uniquely determine the applied operations just by observing the end state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of x with respect to time (dx/dt) directly influences the state of x at time T; similarly, the rate of change of y with respect to time (dy/dt) directly influences the state of x at time T; applying the integral transformation T[x(t)] directly influences the state of x at time T."
