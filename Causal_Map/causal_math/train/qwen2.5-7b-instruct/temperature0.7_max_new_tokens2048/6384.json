  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. The function describes a rotation in the complex plane over time t. We analyze the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\).\n\nGiven the computed results of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) followed by \\\\( h(z) \\\\) up to time U, can we determine if \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied after \\\\( g(z) \\\\) by analyzing the state at time U?",
  "Explanation": "Post-application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) integrates the function up to T, and then \\\\( h(z) \\\\) transforms this by derivation from T to U. The derived state at U reflects recent information influenced by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and t, effectively masking whether the integral or derivative, or both, were applied prior since the latest operation dominates the resulting state.\"  ",
