  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z = f(x, y)\\\\) defined on the complex plane, where \\\\(f(x, y) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y)\\\\) and \\\\(u\\\\) and \\\\(v\\\\) are harmonic functions. The transformation considered here is the complex exponential transformation \\\\(g(z) = e^z\\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can it be determined precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\(g(z)\\\\), \\\\(h(z)\\\\), or both) just by knowing \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) does not uniquely determine which interventions were applied because different parameters and sequences of transformations can lead to the same final state due to the properties of the exponential function and the dynamics under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = az\\\\). Multiple possible scenarios could result in the same endpoint, creating ambiguity in back-tracing the exact interventions used.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Knowing z(T) allows us to trace back the transformations applied, specifically whether g(z) or h(z) or both were used, since z(T) is the result of applying either g(z), h(z), or both to z."
