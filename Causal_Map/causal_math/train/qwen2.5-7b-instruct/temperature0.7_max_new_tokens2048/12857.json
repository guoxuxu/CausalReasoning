  "Problem": "Examine the impact of a Fourier transform on the system governed by the partial differential equation describing heat conduction \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\kappa \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) represents temperature distribution along a rod and \\\\(\\\\kappa\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. The Fourier transform of \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) with respect to space is defined as \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx} u(x,t) dx\\\\).\n\nCan we accurately retrieve the original temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, t=0) \\\\) by inverse transforming \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) without knowledge of correct phase shifts introduced during transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Successful reconstruction of \\\\( u(x, t=0) \\\\) from \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) requires accurate phase information which is dictated by the original conditions and evolution; missing or incorrect phase shift information may result in significant reconstruction errors.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Fourier transform → \\(\\hat{u}(k, t)\\); \\(\\hat{u}(k, t) → u(x, t)\\); \\(t = 0 → u(x, t)\\); inverse Fourier transform → \\(u(x, t)\\)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The Fourier transform of the temperature distribution u(x, t) with respect to space results in \\(\\hat{u}(k, t)\\), which can be inverse transformed to retrieve u(x, t) at any time t, including t=0, provided correct phase shifts are accounted for."
