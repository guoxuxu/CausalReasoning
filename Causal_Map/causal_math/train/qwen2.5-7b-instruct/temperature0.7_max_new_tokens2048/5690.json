  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) representing a solution to the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u) \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. We investigate the effect of applying the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at different times \\\\( t \\\\), denoted by \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t)) \\\\).\n\nCan we infer the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) uniquely by only analyzing \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, T) \\\\) at some later time T, assuming the transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the Fourier transform is invertible and transforms linearly, knowing \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, T) \\\\) allows us to uniquely reconstruct the transformed initial condition \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, 0) \\\\), and subsequently \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) through the inverse Fourier transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "u(x, 0) → u(x, t); u(x, t) → L(u); u(x, t) → hat{u}(ω, t); hat{u}(ω, 0) → hat{u}(ω, T)",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
