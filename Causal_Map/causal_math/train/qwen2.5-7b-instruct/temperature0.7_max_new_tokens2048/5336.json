  "Problem": "Consider a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\nabla^2 u\\\\), where c is the speed of sound in a medium. We explore the effect of a Fourier transform, defined as \\\\( F(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\omega t} u(t) dt \\\\), on the transformation of the equation.\n\nCan we determine the original function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = 0 after applying a filtering process \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) and undergoing natural system evolution, by only analyzing the solution at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the filter alters specific frequency components, which changes the solution dynamics. Without precise knowledge of the filter characteristics and the initial form of \\\\( u(t) \\\\), reconstructing the exact initial state at t = 0 from observations at t = T becomes ambiguous due to potential alterations in the frequency domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Fourier transform to the function u(t) results in U(ω), then applying a filtering process H(ω) transforms it into U_f(ω), which evolves over time to become U_T(t), and finally, this transforms back into u(T) at time T."
