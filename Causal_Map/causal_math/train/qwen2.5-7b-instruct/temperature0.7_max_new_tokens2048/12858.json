  "Problem": "Examine the impact of a Fourier transform on the system governed by the partial differential equation describing heat conduction \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\kappa \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) represents temperature distribution along a rod and \\\\(\\\\kappa\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. The Fourier transform of \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) with respect to space is defined as \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx} u(x,t) dx\\\\).\n\nIf a control function \\\\( g(x, t) = \\\\alpha x^2 \\\\) is added into the system such that \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\kappa \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} + g(x,t)\\\\) and its Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(k, t) \\\\) influences the evolution, will the system's behavior at time T still follow the original heat equation model?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( g(x, t) \\\\) modifies the system dynamics and adds additional components to the heat equation. This intervention alters the trivial reflection of pure diffusion as it contributes additional spatial terms affecting temperature distribution.",
