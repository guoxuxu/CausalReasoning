  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u + iv \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z + cz^2 \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\) are constants. We explore the behavior when subjected to an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s}z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention changes the function form to \\\\( \\\\tilde{z}(t) = z(t) + \\\\alpha e^{\\\\beta t} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) are constants) at time \\\\( t = t_1 \\\\), will the new transformed function \\\\( T(\\\\tilde{z}(T)) \\\\) at T > t_1 depend only on the parameters \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention distinctly changes the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by adding a component \\\\( \\\\alpha e^{\\\\beta t} \\\\), which significantly influences the response under the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\). Therefore, the output \\\\( T(\\\\tilde{z}(T)) \\\\) will depend on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), as well as \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
