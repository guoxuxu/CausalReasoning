  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\) with variable \\\\(t\\\\) representing time. We study the effects of a transformation \\\\(g(z) = z^2\\\\) and explore causal relationships and interventions in the temporal evolution of \\\\(z(t)\\\\).\n\nCan the original complex value \\\\(z_0\\\\) at \\\\(t = 0\\\\) be deduced after observing \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\) without knowing whether \\\\(g(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\(g(z) = z^2\\\\) was applied, determining \\\\(z_0\\\\) just from \\\\(z(T)\\\\) is infeasible. The transformation could alter the evolution making \\\\(z_0\\\\) ambiguous because of the potential change in frequency (phase shift) and magnitude.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
