  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations evolving over time given by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear operator. The impact of a Laplace Transform, denoted by \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(u(t))(s) \\\\), is investigated, where s represents a complex variable.\n\nIf the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(s) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and it evolves under the original differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) without further intervention, will the transformed state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(s, T) \\\\) just reflect the impact of \\\\( L \\\\) over time T?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform converts the time domain problem into the s-domain, where the evolution governed by L reflects how the system behaves under this transformation. The linear operator L continuously applies in the s-domain, thus \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(s, T) \\\\) indeed reflects the impact of \\\\( L \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "u(t) → Lu; u(t) → ∂u/∂t; u(0) → hat{u}(s); hat{u}(s) → hat{u}(s, T)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state u(t) of the system is transformed by the linear operator L, resulting in Lu. This transformation leads to the evolution of u(t) according to the partial differential equation ∂u/∂t = Lu. Applying the Laplace Transform to u(0) yields hat{u}(s), which then evolves to hat{u}(s, T) reflecting the impact of L over time T."
