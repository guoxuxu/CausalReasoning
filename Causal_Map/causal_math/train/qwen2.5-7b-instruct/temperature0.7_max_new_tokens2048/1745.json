  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit that can be modeled as a linear system governed by \\\\( Ax = b \\\\), where A is a matrix representing the circuit parameters, x is the voltage across various components, and b is the input current source vector. An integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(x) = \\\\int_a^b x(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) is applied to observe accumulated voltage responses over time.\n\nIf the input current source vector \\\\( b \\\\) is modified at time t = 0 and then allowed to evolve through the system without further adjustments, will the transformed output \\\\( T(x) \\\\) from a to b be the same as if \\\\( b \\\\) were not modified?",
  "Explanation": "Changing \\\\( b \\\\) alters the system's response, thus modifying the voltage outcomes across the components. The integral transformation \\\\( T(x) \\\\) accumulates these effects over time, leading to a different accumulation of voltage response as compared to the unmodified input condition.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Modifying the input current source vector \\( b \\) at time \\( t = 0 \\) changes the voltage across various components \\( x \\), which in turn affects the accumulated voltage response \\( T(x) \\) from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\). Therefore, the transformed output \\( T(x) \\) will differ if \\( b \\) is modified compared to when it remains unchanged."
