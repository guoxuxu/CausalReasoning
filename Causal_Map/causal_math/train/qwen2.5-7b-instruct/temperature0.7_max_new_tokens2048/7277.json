  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\( u_t + au_x = 0 \\) where \\( a \\) is a constant. Study the effect of a Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}[u(x,t)] \\) on the variable \\( u \\).\n\nIf \\( u(x, 0) \\) is transformed by \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) and then allowed to evolve according to \\( u_t + au_x = 0 \\) without further intervention, will \\( u(x, T) \\) at \\( t = T \\) be the same as if \\( u(x, 0) \\) was directly evolved to \\( t = T \\) under \\( u_t + au_x = 0 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) changes the representation of the function from the spatial domain to the frequency domain. Although the evolution under \\( u_t + au_x = 0 \\) still holds, the initial conditions are altered by the Fourier transform, thus affecting the system's state at any later time \\( T \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "u(x,0) → u(x,T); Fourier transform[u(x,0)] → u(x,T)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u(x,0) directly influences u(x,T) through the evolution equation u_t + au_x = 0. Applying the Fourier transform to u(x,0) at t=0 and then evolving it according to the same equation also leads to u(x,T), showing that the Fourier transform does not change the outcome of the evolution."
