  "Problem": "Consider a scenario involving a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined as \\\\( z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{As}x(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent vector function and A is a constant matrix. The transformation used is \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), with B also being a constant matrix.\n\nDoes the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) to \\\\( z_0 \\\\), the integral of \\\\( x(s) \\\\) from 0 to t, and then letting the system evolve without further intervention, result in the same outcome as if the original function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is integrated up to time T under the influence of A only?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) modifies the integrated value of \\\\( x(s) \\\\), potentially changing the growth pattern or direction influenced by the matrix B in addition to A. Therefore, the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be different due to the compounded effect of B and A.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input vector function x(t) directly influences the function z(t) through integration. The transformation f(z) depends on z(t) and the matrix B. Matrix A directly causes z(t) through its role in defining the integral function. The evolution of f(z) over time is influenced by B."
