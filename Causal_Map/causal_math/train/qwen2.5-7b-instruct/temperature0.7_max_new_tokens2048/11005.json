  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant. The system undergoes analysis under the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\omega z\\\\) without further intervention, will the resultant \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) evolved directly under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\omega z\\\\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at t = 0 modifies the initial condition to \\\\( e^{kT}z_0 \\\\), which evolves differently under the given differential equation compared to the unmodified \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The factor \\\\( e^{kT} \\\\) introduces an exponential growth or decay and phase shift dependent on the real and imaginary parts of \\\\(k\\\\), respectively, leading to a different outcome at time T.",
