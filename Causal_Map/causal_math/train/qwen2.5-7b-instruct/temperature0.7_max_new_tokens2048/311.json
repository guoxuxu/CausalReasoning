  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) where A is a complex number. Analyze the mappings when transformed by this exponential function in the complex plane, considering different paths in the complex plane.\n\nIf the function is modified at a particular point z by multiplying with another function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bz} \\\\) (where B is another complex number), will the resultant integral \\\\( \\\\int_C f(z)g(z) \\\\, dz \\\\) be solely influenced by A?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying by \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces a new dynamic into the path integral. The resultant function \\\\( f(z)g(z) = e^{(A+B)z} \\\\) shows dependency on both A and B, which means the outcome of the integral over C is influenced by both.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
