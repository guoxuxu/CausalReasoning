  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( t \\\\) is time. The impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( \\mathcal{F}(z)(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\, dt \\\\) over time is studied, where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nCan the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) be determined from the output \\\\( \\mathcal{F}(z')(s) \\\\) after an unknown intervention changed \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to some \\\\( z'(t) = e^{i\\omega' t} \\\\), knowing only \\\\( \\mathcal{F}(z')(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "With the transform output \\\\( \\mathcal{F}(z')(s) \\\\) alone, it is impossible to deduce the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) because the intervention fundamentally alters the function to \\\\( z'(t) \\\\), and the transformation output reflects only the properties of the modified system.",
