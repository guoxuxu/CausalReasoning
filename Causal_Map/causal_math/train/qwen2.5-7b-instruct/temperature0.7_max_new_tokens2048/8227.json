  "Problem": "Investigate the relationship between two complex functions \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}w \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where A and B are complex constant matrices, considering the integral transformations over a time interval [0, T].\n\nAssuming another transformation \\\\( q(t) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) (where C is a constant matrix) is intervened at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the final expression of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 solely rely on the effects of A?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing an intervention \\\\( q(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) adds a layer of complexity involving matrix C, thereby making the trajectory and the final state at time T dependent not only on A but also on the effects introduced by C and the previous effects of B. The transformations compose non-trivially, influencing the entire evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
