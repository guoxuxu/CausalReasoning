  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( u(x, t) \\) representing a heat distribution over a rod along the spatial variable x and time t, governed by the heat equation \\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\), where \\( k \\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We explore the effects of applying a source term \\( S(x,t) \\), which varies along x and t.\n\nIf at time \\( t_1 \\), heat insulation (an intervention halting any heat exchange) is applied at a specific location \\( x_1 \\) on the rod, will the resulting distribution \\( u(x, T) \\) at \\( t = T > t_1 \\) only depend on the thermal diffusivity \\( k \\) without being affected by the source \\( S(x,t) \\) or the initial conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of heat insulation modifies the boundary conditions and hence the distribution \\( u(x, T) \\) post \\( t_1 \\). Although it relies heavily on the diffusivity \\( k \\), the final temperature distribution at \\( t = T \\) still reflects the cumulative effects of initial conditions, the source term \\( S(x,t) \\), and the localized insulation.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying heat insulation at a specific location x1 on the rod at time t1 halts any further changes in temperature at that point, making the heat distribution u(x, T) at a later time T solely dependent on the thermal diffusivity k and the state of the system just before the insulation was applied, independent of the source term S(x,t) and initial conditions after t1."
