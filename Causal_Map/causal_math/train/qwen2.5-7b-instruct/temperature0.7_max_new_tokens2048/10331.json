  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a temperature distribution in a rod, modeled by the heat equation \\\\(u_t = k u_{xx}\\\\), where \\\\(u(t,x)\\\\) represents the temperature at position x and time t, and k is a constant diffusion coefficient. Consider a Fourier transform \\\\(F(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-iwx} u(x) dx\\\\) being applied as a transformation.\n\nIf a Fourier transform is applied to \\\\(u(t_1, x)\\\\) at some intermediate time t_1 and then the results are fed into the heat equation until time T > t_1, will the end temperature distribution \\\\(u(T, x)\\\\) only be governed by the original heat equation constant k and not influenced by the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The intermediate application of the Fourier transform alters the condition of the system in frequency space, possibly emphasizing certain frequencies which behave differently under the heat equation. Hence, the final state at time T will carry traces of this transformation, making the output reliant on both k and the effect of the Fourier transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The temperature distribution's time evolution is governed by the heat equation constant k, and the Fourier transform influences the initial condition but does not change the fundamental time evolution described by the heat equation."
