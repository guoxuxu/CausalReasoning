  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\) where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are complex variables and the function is defined as \\\\( f(x, y) = e^{Ax + By} \\\\). Here, A and B are constant matrices. We assess how the sequence of partial differentiation with respect to \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) and their integrations influence the outcome.\n\nIf partial derivatives \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial x} \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial y} \\\\) are calculated sequentially and then integrated back, does the result equal to original \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\) assuming no other transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The integration process introduces constants of integration that may not necessarily align with the original function's parameters, especially considering non-commutativity of the matrices A and B in exponents. The result depends on paths of integration and initial conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
