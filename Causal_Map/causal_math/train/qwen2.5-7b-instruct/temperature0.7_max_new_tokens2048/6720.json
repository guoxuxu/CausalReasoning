  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{st} x(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is an input time-dependent function and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable. We examine the causal relationships when manipulating the input \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and analyzing its impact on the output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) using different transformations.\n\nCan we deduce from the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) whether a change in input function occurred at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and what the nature of that change was?",
  "Explanation": "The integration and complex exponential potentially obscure the details of when and how the input function was changed. Multiple different scenarios could lead to the same or similar cumulative output in \\\\( z(T) \\\\), making it difficult to isolate and identify with certainty specific changes in input function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
