  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where A is a complex matrix and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex vector. We study the role of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = Ce^{Bt}z \\\\), where B and C are also complex matrices.\n\nBy observing the vector \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T, can we infer the initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) exactly, without information about whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The possible application of transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\), which compounds effects of matrices C and B, makes it impossible to precisely deduce \\\\( z_0 \\\\) if the possibility of their influence is unknown. The exponential and complex nature of B and C can obscure or alter initial conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
