  "Problem": "Consider a system function defined by \\\\(z(x) = \\int_{0}^{x} e^{y} dy\\\\) representing an integral transformation of the exponential function. The focus is to analyze the derivative and anti-derivative relationships between transformations.\n\nKnowing the function outcome \\\\(z(x) = \\int_{0}^{x} e^{2y} dy\\\\) and its derivative, can we conclude that the scaling intervention function \\\\(h(x) = 2x\\\\) was used initially, without other information?",
  "Explanation": "While we can calculate the derivative to be \\\\(e^{2x}\\\\) and identify the form of the integrand as \\\\(e^{2y}\\\\), without knowing the precise modifications or absence of other potential transformations, we cannot be certain that exactly \\\\(h(x) = 2x\\\\) was applied. Other similar transformations could potentially yield the same derivative or functional form.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function z(x) is the antiderivative of the function h(x) scaled by e^(2y), and z'(x) is directly related to h(x) through the exponential scaling."
