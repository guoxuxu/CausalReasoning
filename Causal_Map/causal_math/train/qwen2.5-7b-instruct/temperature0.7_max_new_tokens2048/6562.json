  "Problem": "Investigate a signal processing model driven by a linear time-invariant system with impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) governed by its Laplace Transform \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+a} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a positive constant. The impact of a Fourier transform modulation \\\\( m(t) = e^{i\\\\omega_0 t} \\\\) on the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is analyzed.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) of the system, can it be inferred if the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) was modulated by \\\\( m(t) = e^{i\\\\omega_0 t} \\\\), assuming no additional knowledge about \\\\( x(t) \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific information on the original input \\\\( x(t) \\\\) or the modulation frequency \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\), numerous combinations of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) could result in the same output \\\\( y(t) \\\\), due to the transformation properties and convolution with \\\\( h(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The modulation m(t) directly influences the input signal x(t); the impulse response H(s) determines the output y(t) based on the input x(t)."
