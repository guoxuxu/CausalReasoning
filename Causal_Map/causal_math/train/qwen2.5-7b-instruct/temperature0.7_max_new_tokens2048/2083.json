  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\) where \\\\(\\omega\\) is a real constant representing the angular frequency. We are interested in observing how an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](t) = \\int_0^t f(s) ds \\\\) affects this function over time t.\n\nIf a differential operation represented by \\\\( D[f](t) = f'(t) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) at t = T/2, will the resulting function at t = T be solely dependent on the initial function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and not influenced by the transformation \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the differential operation as an intervention modifies the transformation output by differentiating the accumulated function. This derived function is dependent on both the behavior of the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and the effects of the transformation \\\\( T \\\\), hence influenced by both.",
