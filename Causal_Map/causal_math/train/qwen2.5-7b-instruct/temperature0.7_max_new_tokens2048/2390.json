  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iAz + B \\\\cos(t)z \\\\), where A and B are constant real numbers. The study involves a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{-Ct}z \\\\) applied to \\\\( z \\\\), where C is also a constant real number.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T, can we infer unambiguously the initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The presence or absence of the initial transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{-Ct}z \\\\) significantly affects the trajectory. Without clear knowledge if the transformation was applied, there can be multiple plausible initial values \\\\( z_0 \\\\) leading to the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\), especially as the influence of C intertwines with the oscillatory behavior induced by \\\\( B \\\\cos(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
