  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature \\( T \\) across a rod varies over time and can be described by the heat equation \\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2} \\) where \\( k \\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. An external heat source modifies the initial temperature distribution as \\( f(T) = T_0 + h \\\\sin(\\\\omega x) \\) where \\( T_0 \\) is the initial uniform temperature, \\( h \\) is the amplitude, and \\( \\\\omega \\) the frequency of the heat variation.\n\nIf \\( f(T) \\) sets the initial temperature distribution and the system evolves according to the heat equation without further alteration, will the temperature distribution at a later time \\( t = T \\) replicate the initial pattern introduced by \\( f(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the diffusion nature of the heat equation, the initial sinusoidal variation introduced by \\( f(T) \\) will diminish over time. The temperature distribution will tend to become uniform, with variations decreasing as \\( t \\) increases.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial temperature distribution set by f(T) influences the temperature T, which then changes over time according to the heat equation, with thermal diffusivity k determining the spatial rate of change of temperature."
