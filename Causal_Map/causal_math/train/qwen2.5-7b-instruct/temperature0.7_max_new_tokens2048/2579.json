  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency. The function \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) is considered over time t, with \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) being a real constant.\n\nIf we apply an intervention \\\\( q(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a real constant) at a particular time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resulting \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) given that the system continues to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state of the system \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is affected by both \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) from the initial transformation and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) from the intervention due to cumulative scaling effects that alter the magnitude of \\\\( z \\\\) over time, in addition to the rotational dynamic imparted by \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
