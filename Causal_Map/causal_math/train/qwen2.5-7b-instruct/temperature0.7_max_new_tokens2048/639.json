  "Problem": "Consider a fluid dynamics system where the velocity field is described by \\\\( v(x, t) \\\\) and evolves according to the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial v}{\\\\partial t} = -\\\\nabla p + \\\\nu \\\\nabla^2 v \\\\), where \\\\( p \\\\) is the pressure field and \\\\( \\\\nu \\\\) is the viscosity. We examine the effect of an applied external force \\\\( F(x, t) \\\\) represented by \\\\( F(x, t) = e^{Mt}x \\\\), where M is a constant matrix.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another force \\\\( G(x, t) = e^{Nt}x \\\\) (where N is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( v(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of M or N?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of another modifying force \\\\( G(x, t) \\\\) introduces additional dynamics into the velocity field, making the final state \\\\( v(x, T) \\\\) reliant on both M and N, as well as the fluid dynamics itself. The combined effects of these forces influence the trajectory of \\\\( v(x, t) \\\\) in a complex manner.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An applied external force F(x, t) and another force G(x, t) both influence the velocity field v(x, T) through their respective time-dependent expressions. Pressure p and viscosity ν also directly cause changes in the velocity field v(x, t). The introduction of an intervention at time t_1, represented by force G(x, t), does not independently affect the endpoint v(x, T) beyond its direct influence on v(x, t) via the same causal mechanisms as F(x, t)."
