  "Problem": "We consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) where A is a constant matrix. The system is subjected to an integral transform defined by \\\\( g(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{B\\\\tau}x(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where B is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( x_0 \\\\) is transformed at t = 0 by \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) for a period T without any other intervention, will the outcome \\\\( x(T) \\\\) be identical to the evolution of \\\\( x_0 \\\\) under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) for the same period?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) alters the initial state by integrating the effect of \\\\( e^{B\\\\tau} \\\\) over time, changing the trajectory of the system from that point onward. Since \\\\( g(x) \\\\) incorporates a convolution with a matrix exponential, the original dynamics governed solely by A are fundamentally modified.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition x_0 directly influences x(t) through the differential equation \\(\\dot{x} = Ax\\), and x(t) evolves to become x(T) after time T. Applying the integral transform g(x_0) results in a new initial condition that directly influences x(T) under the same differential equation."
