  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( u_t = Lu \\\\) where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. We review the effect of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) = \\\\hat{u} \\\\), and how it translates to solve the equation in the transformed domain.\n\nGiven the system's state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether the Fourier transform, operator \\\\( M \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions from the system's state at \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) is complicated by the potential overlap in the effects of the Fourier transform and operator \\\\( M \\\\). The transformations could yield similar results through different pathways, creating ambiguity in backtracking the exact interventions used.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
