  "Problem": "Consider a complex function mapping operation where \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) evolves over time under the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t} z \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a constant real number and \\\\( i \\\\) representing the imaginary unit.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( k(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real number) is applied as an intervention, does the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) only depend on \\\\( c \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The multiple transformations (both \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and subsequently \\\\( k(z) \\\\)) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) modify the evolution path and final state at different rates and directions in the complex plane, making \\\\( z(T) \\\\) reliant on all parameters (\\\\( c, \\\\omega, \\\\alpha \\\\)), not just \\\\( c \\\\).",
