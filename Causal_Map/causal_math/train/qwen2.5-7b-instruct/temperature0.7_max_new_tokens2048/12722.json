  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolving in time according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), where P is a constant complex number. The system's evolution is further examined under an integral transformation represented by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-Ps} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( U(z) = \\\\int_0^{t_1} e^{-Qt}z(t) dt \\\\) (where Q is another constant complex number) is applied as an intervention, will the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on P and not on Q?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( U(z) \\\\) introduces a cumulative effect influenced by Q, altering how the function is integrated and evolves, which affects the final state at time T, making it dependent on both P and Q.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of z with respect to time is determined by P, while the application of U(z) at t1 introduces Q which affects the integral transformation but does not directly influence the final state z(T) for T > t1."
