  "Problem": "Consider the linear transformation defined by the matrix operator \\\\( L[y] = p(t) \\\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + q(t) \\\\frac{dy}{dt} + r(t) y \\\\), where \\\\( p(t), q(t), r(t) \\\\) are continuous functions. We examine the application of an integral transform \\\\( T[y] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty k(t, s) y(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( k(t, s) \\\\) is the kernel of the transform.\n\nIf \\\\( T[y] \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( y(t) \\\\) satisfying the differential equation \\\\( L[y] = 0 \\\\) with initial conditions, and then the result is allowed to evolve under \\\\( L[T[y]] \\\\), will the transformed result \\\\( y'(t) \\\\) solve the same differential equation, i.e., does \\\\( L[y'] = 0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T[y] \\\\) generally alters the properties of the function \\\\( y(t) \\\\). Unless \\\\( k(t, s) \\\\) is specifically designed to commute with the differential operator \\\\( L \\\\), the transformation will likely change the differential properties, making \\\\( L[y'] \\\\neq 0 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the differential operator L to a function y that satisfies L[y] = 0 results in 0, and the integral transform T applied to y results in y', so applying L to y' also results in 0."
