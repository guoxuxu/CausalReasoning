  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the equation \\\\( z = f(x) = x^3 + 3x^2 + 2 \\\\) and its Laplace Transform, which transforms the function into the s-domain as \\\\( F(s) \\\\). We explore whether the transformed system under differently parameterized transformations still retains causal relationships.\n\nIf an intervention is made in the s-domain by adding a function \\\\( G(s) = s \\\\) at some point \\\\( s_0 \\\\) before reverting via inverse transform, will the causal effect of \\\\( x_0 \\\\) on z at specific time points remain unchanged?",
  "Explanation": "Adding \\\\( G(s) = s \\\\) in the s-domain modifies the transformed function in a manner not directly equivalent to any operation in the x-domain under \\\\( f(x) \\\\). The intervention alters the original pathway, and thus the effects will not mirror the unaltered system's behavior.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of x_0 directly influences z. The transformation to the s-domain via Laplace Transform (F(s)) and the addition of G(s) at s_0 do not change the direct causal relationship between x_0 and z. Reverting back through the inverse transform does not alter this relationship either."
