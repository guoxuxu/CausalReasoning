  "Problem": "Considering a signal processing scenario where a continuous-time signal \\( x(t) \\) undergoes a Fourier transform to produce \\( X(f) \\), and then a filter characterized by a function \\( H(f) \\) is applied to \\( X(f) \\).\n\nIf a signal \\( x(t) \\) is transformed to \\( X(f) \\) and then filtered by \\( H(f) \\) without any modification to \\( H(f) \\), will the output signal \\( y(t) \\), obtained by the inverse Fourier transform of \\( Y(f) = H(f)X(f) \\), reflect the characteristics imposed by \\( H(f) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output signal \\( y(t) \\) will indeed reflect the characteristics of \\( H(f) \\), as it directly modifies \\( X(f) \\) in the frequency domain, effectively shaping the output \\( y(t) \\) based on \\( H(f)'s \\) properties, like bandwidth or cut-off frequencies.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The continuous-time signal x(t) is transformed to its frequency domain representation X(f), which is then multiplied by the filter function H(f) to produce H(f)X(f). The resulting frequency domain signal H(f)X(f) is inverse-Fourier transformed to yield the output signal y(t)."
