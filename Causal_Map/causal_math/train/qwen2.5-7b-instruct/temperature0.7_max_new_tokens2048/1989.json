  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\ = \\ e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We examine the effect of a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\\\( M \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at different times.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( Mz(t) \\\\) is applied to the function at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve naturally under \\\\( z(t) \\ = \\ e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) without further intervention, will the resultant function at t = T still obey the initial transformation rule set by \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( Mz(t) \\\\) modifies the initial function at t = 0, influencing the trajectory of function evolution. As \\\\( z(t) \\ = \\ e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) evolves, the angle of rotation due to \\\\( \\omega \\\\) might interact differently when scaled or rotated initially by \\\\( M \\\\), resulting in a function that does not strictly adhere to just \\\\( M \\\\) applied to the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\) path over time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
