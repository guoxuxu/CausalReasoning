  "Problem": "Imagine a mechanical system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} = -kx\\\\), where k is a positive constant, representing a simple harmonic oscillator. We explore the use of the operator transformation \\\\( L(x) = x + at \\\\), where a is a constant, to analyze perturbations in motion over time t.\n\nAfter observing the position \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at time t, can we infer the initial position \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( L(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( L(x) \\\\), determining the exact initial position \\\\( x_0 \\\\) is not feasible because the transformation may have altered the true starting condition. The additional term introduced by \\\\( L(x) \\\\) obscures the original state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
