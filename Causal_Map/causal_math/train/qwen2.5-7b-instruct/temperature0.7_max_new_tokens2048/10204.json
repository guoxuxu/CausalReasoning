  "Problem": "We examine the impact of a complex transformation given by \\\\( z \\mapsto w(z) = e^{i\\pi z} \\\\) on the real and imaginary components of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) satisfy the coupled differential equations \\\\( \\dot{x} = -y \\\\) and \\\\( \\dot{y} = x \\\\).\n\nCan we precisely deduce whether the initial transformation \\\\( w(z) \\\\) and/or the later intervention \\\\( v(z) \\\\) were applied, based solely on observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the harmonic nature of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)’s evolution and multiple transformations adding complex shifts and adjustments, different combinations of transformations and interventions can produce equivalent final states. Without additional information, it is impossible to uniquely identify which transformations or interventions were deployed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
