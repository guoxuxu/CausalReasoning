  "Problem": "We consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\) in the complex plane. An integral transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) with complex variable s is applied.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) initially and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T = \\\\( \\\\pi \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) was directly evolved to T = \\\\( \\\\pi \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) represents a Laplace-type transformation, which does not affect the real-time evolution under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\). Since \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) is a solution to this differential equation, any application of \\\\( f \\\\) will not alter the real-time behavior or outcome at any specific T, thus \\\\( z(\\\\pi) = -1 \\\\) in both cases.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z at time T is determined by its initial form and the evolution equation. Applying the integral transformation f(z) does not change the eventual value of z(T) when the system is allowed to evolve according to \\(\\dot{z} = iz\\) from the same initial condition."
