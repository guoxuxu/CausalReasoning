  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit where the output voltage \\\\( V(t) \\\\) across a capacitor depends on the input current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) according to the integral transformation \\\\( V(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-(t-s)/RC} I(s) \\\\, ds \\\\), where R and C are constants representing the resistance and capacitance, respectively.\n\nIf an intervention changes the input current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) midway at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to a different constant function, will the output voltage at any later time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) still depend on the original input current before \\\\( t_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Despite the change in the input current at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the output voltage at any time T > \\\\( t_1 \\\\) still reflects the influence of the initial segment of \\\\( I(t) \\\\) from 0 to \\\\( t_1 \\\\) due to the integral's dependence over the entire interval from 0 to T. Each part of the input current contributes to the final output voltage.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input current I(t) directly causes the output voltage V(t). An intervention changing I(t) at t_1 will affect V(T) for T > t_1, thus V(T) still depends on the original I(t) before t_1."
