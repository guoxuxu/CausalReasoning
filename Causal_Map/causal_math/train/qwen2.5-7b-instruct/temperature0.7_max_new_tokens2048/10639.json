  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex system where the temperature \\( T(x,t) \\) at a point \\( x \\) and time \\( t \\) is governed by the heat equation \\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2} \\), where \\( k \\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. The system undergoes an intervention where for \\( t \\geq t_0 \\), an external source \\( S(x,t) = A e^{-\\\\omega t} \\\\sin(\\\\omega x) \\) (where \\( A \\) and \\( \\\\omega \\) are constants) heats the system.\n\nIf the external source \\( S(x,t) \\) starts influencing the system at \\( t = t_0 \\), will the final state \\( T(x,T) \\) be independent of the initial temperature distribution \\( T_0(x) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\( T(x,T) \\) depends both on the initial distribution \\( T_0(x) \\) and the external source \\( S(x,t) \\). The source adds heat according to its defined function, altering the natural progression of the temperature, thus the final state is influenced by both \\( T_0(x) \\) and \\( S(x,t) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "S(x,t) → T(x,t); T(x,t_0-) → T(x,t_0+); T(x,t_0-) → T(x,t); T_0(x) → T(x,t_0-)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The external source S(x,t) directly influences the temperature T(x,t) starting from t = t_0. The initial temperature distribution T_0(x) determines the temperature T(x,t_0-) just before the intervention begins, which then evolves to T(x,t) under the influence of the heat equation and the external source."
