  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations governed by the matrix function \\\\( M(t) = P e^{Qt} \\\\), where P is a constant matrix and Q is a diagonal matrix. The system's evolution is analyzed under a linear transformation \\\\( f(x) = Lx \\\\) followed by a temporal evolution described by \\\\( M(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we infer the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without knowing if the transformation \\\\( f(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( Lx \\\\) was applied at t = 0, reconstructing the exact \\\\( x_0 \\\\) from \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is uncertain. The transformation could alter the initial conditions in such a way that multiple potential original vectors could evolve to the same \\\\( x(t) \\\\) under \\\\( M(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
