  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( L\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\), where F(s) represents the transformed complex function. We explore the impact of modifying the function to \\\\( f(t) + tg(t) \\\\), where \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is another function, on the Laplace transform over variable s.\n\nGiven the combined Laplace transform \\\\( L\\\\{f(t) + tg(t)\\\\} \\\\), can we uniquely determine both \\\\( L\\\\{f(t)\\\\} \\\\) and \\\\( L\\\\{tg(t)\\\\} \\\\) separately without additional information about \\\\( f(t) \\\\) or \\\\( g(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the Laplace transform's linearity allows for the sum of transforms, without knowing either \\\\( f(t) \\\\) or \\\\( g(t) \\\\), the individual transforms cannot be uniquely determined from their sum due to the intrinsic properties of integral transformations.",
