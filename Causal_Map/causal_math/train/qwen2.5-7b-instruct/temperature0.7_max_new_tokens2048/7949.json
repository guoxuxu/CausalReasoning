  "Problem": "Consider a linear system undergoing a Fourier transform, which converts a function of time, \\\\( g(t) \\\\), into a function of frequency, \\\\( G(f) \\\\). The impact of an additional Laplace transformation \\\\( L \\\\{ g(t) \\\\} = G(s) \\\\) on this system is explored over time and frequency domains.\n\nIf the system is only subjected to a Fourier transform resulting in \\\\( G(f) \\\\), and then evolves naturally without other transformations, does \\\\( G(f) \\\\) at any frequency \\\\( f \\\\) remain unaltered over time if no further transformation is applied?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform itself is a stable transformation under time evolution without any further modification. The frequency component \\\\( G(f) \\\\) remains constant unless acted upon by an external transformation or operation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
