  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the linear time-invariant differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx + Nu\\\\), where \\\\(M\\\\) is a constant matrix representing the system's dynamics and \\\\(N\\\\) is a control matrix. The control input \\\\(u(t)\\\\) is transformed by a function \\\\( h(u) = e^{Kt}u \\\\) over time t, where \\\\(K\\\\) is also a constant matrix.\n\nObserving the system state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at t = T, can we deduce the exact original control input \\\\( u(0) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( h(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is dependent on the transformed control input, which may vary depending on the properties of \\\\( K \\\\). Without knowing the transformation applied, one cannot uniquely recover \\\\( u(0) \\\\) especially if \\\\( K \\\\) modifies the trajectory non-trivially.",
