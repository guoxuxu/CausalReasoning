  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant and \\\\(i\\\\) denotes the imaginary unit. We examine the effect of a Fourier transformation defined by \\\\(F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt\\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\(z(t)\\\\) to \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega' t}\\\\) at some time t midpoint, where \\\\(\\\\omega'\\\\neq \\\\omega\\\\), will the spectrum \\\\(F(\\\\omega)\\\\) still show a delta function only at the original \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) to \\\\(\\\\omega'\\\\) midway creates a scenario where the signal comprises two different frequencies. The resulting Fourier transform will reflect this, showing delta functions at both \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega'\\\\), not merely at the original \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function z(t) influences F(ω) through ω, and changing z(t) to z(t) = e^(iω' t) changes ω to ω'. This modification to z(t) and ω will alter F(ω), potentially removing the delta function peak at the original ω."
