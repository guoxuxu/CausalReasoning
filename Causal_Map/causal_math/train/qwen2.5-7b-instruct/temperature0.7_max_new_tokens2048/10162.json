  "Problem": "Examine the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) under the action of a differential operator \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) satisfy the coupled equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = -y + p(t)x \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = x + p(t)y \\\\), and \\\\( p(t) \\\\) is a known function of time t.\n\nGiven the observation of \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can the initial state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) be uniquely determined without additional information about intermediate transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The unique backward determination of \\\\( z(0) \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without any knowledge of the function \\\\( p(t) \\\\) during the interval is not feasible. The system's dependence on \\\\( p(t) \\\\) throughout its evolution introduces inherent uncertainty about past states unless \\\\( p(t) \\\\) is specifically known.",
