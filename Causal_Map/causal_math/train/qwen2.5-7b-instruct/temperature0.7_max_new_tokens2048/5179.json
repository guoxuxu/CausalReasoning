  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\), where \\( t \\) is time. We evaluate the integration of this function transformed by a differential operator \\( D \\) such that \\( Dz = \\frac{d^n}{dt^n}z \\), for different values of \\( n \\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), a new operator \\( E \\) defined by \\( Ez = \\frac{d^m}{dt^m}z \\), where \\( m = 3 \\), is applied as an intervention, will the function \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) be solely dependent on \\( t \\) and not on the actions of \\( D \\) or \\( E \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( E \\) alters the state further by transforming \\( z \\) into a higher derivative (third derivative in this case). Thus, \\( z(T) \\) will depend on both \\( D \\), \\( E \\) (the first and third derivatives) and how these derivatives interact over the interval from \\( t_1 \\) to \\( T \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Time t directly influences the function z(t). The differential operators D and E cause changes in z(t), but after applying E at t1, the function z(T) for T > t1 is solely dependent on t and not on the actions of D or E."
