  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the state of a system is described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Cx + Du \\\\), where C and D are constant matrices and u is a control input. Assume the control input is transformed according to \\\\( g(u) = K e^{Lt} u \\\\), where K and L are also constant matrices.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine whether the control input was transformed by \\\\( g(u) \\\\) or if it was just \\\\( u \\\\), assuming no prior knowledge of the form of u?",
  "Explanation": "The state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) resulting from a transformed control input or a standard input can be similar due to variations in initial conditions and the inherent properties of the matrices C, D, K, and L. Without explicit knowledge of the control input form and initial state, the exact causal path cannot be deduced.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
