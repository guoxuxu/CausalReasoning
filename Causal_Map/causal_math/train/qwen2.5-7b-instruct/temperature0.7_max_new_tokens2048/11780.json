  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\) are constants. We explore the effect of applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = z \\\\cdot e^{Rt} \\\\), where \\\\( R \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), then allowed to evolve according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q \\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to \\\\( T \\\\) under the original differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state, which in turn affects the entire trajectory of the system. The exponential factor \\\\( e^{Rt} \\\\) introduces a multiplying effect that alters the growth pattern and phase of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), resulting in a distinctive state at time \\\\( T \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation f(z) = z * e^(Rt) to z_0 at t=0 and allowing it to evolve according to dz/dt = Pz + Q results in z(T) being different from directly evolving z_0 to T under the original differential equation due to the effect of R."
