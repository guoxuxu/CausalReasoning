  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = g(x, t) = e^{Mt}x \\\\) where M is a constant matrix and x is a complex variable. We examine the role of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ z(t) \\\\} = Z(s) \\\\) in analyzing the system for various conditions.\n\nIf at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a shift transformation \\\\( h(x) = x + c \\\\) (where c is a constant vector) is applied, and then the system is observed at t = T, is the result only dependent on the initial x and not on c?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( h(x) = x + c \\\\) modifies the trajectory by changing the initial conditions of the system directly before evolving it. Thus, the observed result at t = T under the Laplace transform will depend on both the original x and the constant vector c, affecting the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying a shift transformation h(x) = x + c to the initial state x results in a new state x + c, which then influences z(T) through the function z = g(x, t) = e^(Mt)x. However, the final value z(T) depends on the initial state x, but not directly on the shift c."
