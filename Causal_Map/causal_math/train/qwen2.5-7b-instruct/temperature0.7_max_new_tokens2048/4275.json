  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) evolving over time under the influence of a linear differential operator \\\\(L[z] = z' + az\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) is a complex constant. We examine the impact of the transformation \\\\(g(z) = e^{ct}z\\\\) on this system, where \\\\(c\\\\) is another complex constant.\n\nAssuming another transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{dt}z\\\\) (where \\\\(d\\\\) is a complex constant) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), does the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) depend solely on the original operator \\\\(L\\\\) without being influenced by the transformations \\\\(g\\\\) or \\\\(h\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(h(z)\\\\) contributes an additional modifying factor, complicating the direct effect of the operator \\\\(L\\\\). The transformations \\\\(e^{ct}\\\\) and \\\\(e^{dt}\\\\) both significantly affect the trajectory and the eventual state at time \\\\(T\\\\). The complex exponentials can impact how the effects combine and evolve from \\\\(t_1\\\\) to \\\\(T\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
