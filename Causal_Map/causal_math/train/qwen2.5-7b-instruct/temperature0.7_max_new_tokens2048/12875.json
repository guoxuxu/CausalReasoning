  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z = x + iy\\\\), representing a complex variable where \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\) are real numbers. We now explore the implications of the Laplace transform applied to this function, transforming it to \\\\(F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s)\\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex parameter.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\(F(s)\\\\), can we determine from this alone whether a scaling intervention was applied to \\\\(z(t)\\\\), and if so, quantify the exact scaling factor \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without prior knowledge about the original scale of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) or additional constraining information on \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\), it is impossible to uniquely identify and quantify the scaling factor just from \\\\(F(s)\\\\), due to the infinite scaling possibilities that could yield similar transformations in the s-domain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
