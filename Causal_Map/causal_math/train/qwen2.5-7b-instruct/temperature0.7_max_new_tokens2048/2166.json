  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iωt} \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( ω \\\\) is a constant real number. The transformation applied on this function is given by \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\), where n is a fixed positive integer. We investigate the impact of this transformation on the function's behavior.\n\nCan the original function at t = 0 be precisely deduced after observing the function at t = T, without knowing n or whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the power n or application of the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\), the original state cannot be reliably inferred from the observed state at t = T; multiple values of n could lead to different initial states through the transformation, affecting the frequency and phase.",
