  "Problem": "Evaluate the effect of a complex function \\\\( z(s) = e^{s^2} \\\\) on the real function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) when transformed using the Laplace Transform. Let the original system be governed by \\\\( h(t) = t^2 \\\\).\n\nGiven the Laplace Transform of the function at time t, can we deduce the original function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( z(s) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "If \\\\( z(s) \\\\) (the complex function) was applied, it would alter the Laplace Transform in a way that's nontrivial to reverse without explicit knowledge of its application, due to the nonlinear modification represented by \\\\( e^{s^2} \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Without applying z(s) to H(s), we cannot deduce any effect of z(s) on the original function h(t)."
