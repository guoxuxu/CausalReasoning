  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\), where \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) are real functions of time \\( t \\) and \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit. The function is subjected to the Fourier transformation defined by \\( F(z(t)) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty z(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt \\), where \\( \\omega \\) represents angular frequency.\n\nGiven \\( F(z(t)) \\) after the intervention of adding \\( cos(t) \\), can one determine whether the original function \\( z(t) \\) or the transformed function \\( z(t) + cos(t) \\) was used to calculate \\( F(z(t)) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed output \\( F(z(t)) \\) can potentially be indistinguishable if the added terms affect the frequency components in a manner that coincides with or masks the characteristics of the original \\( z(t) \\). Thus, without additional information about the function's state before the intervention, one cannot conclusively identify the source.",
