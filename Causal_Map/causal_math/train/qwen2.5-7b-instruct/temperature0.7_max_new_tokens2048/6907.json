  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where the particle movement on a plane is determined by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) represent the real and imaginary parts of the particle's position at time t, respectively. A Fourier transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t))(\\\\omega) \\\\) is used to analyze the frequency components of the motion.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z'(t) = z(t) e^{iwt} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a constant, will the resultant spectrum \\\\( F'(\\\\omega) \\\\) still reflect only the original frequencies inherent in \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modulates the original function with a frequency \\\\( w \\\\), resulting in a frequency shift in the Fourier spectrum. Thus, the resultant spectrum \\\\( F'(\\\\omega) \\\\) will include unexpected shifts, reflecting the effect of the modulation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
