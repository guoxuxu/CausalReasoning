  "Problem": "Consider a 2D linear system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a constant matrix. Let us introduce a transformation defined by the operator \\\\(L[\\\\phi(x)] = \\\\int_0^t e^{Bs} \\\\phi(x(s)) ds\\\\), where \\\\(B\\\\) is also a constant matrix. We study the system's behavior over time with this transformation.\n\nGiven the evolved state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) attained through the modified dynamics \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) influenced by \\\\(L\\\\), can we uniquely determine the initial state \\\\(x_0\\\\) without knowing whether \\\\(L\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\(L\\\\) changes the initial state's influence by integrating over a potentially transformed path, and lacking knowledge of the usage of \\\\(L\\\\), it impedes reversing the integral transformation to uniquely determine \\\\(x_0\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
