  "Problem": "Consider a transfer function in a linear time-invariant (LTI) system given by \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), where 'a' is a constant. We analyze the influence of performing an inverse Laplace transform under the scenario of differentiating the impulse response associated with H(s).\n\nIf the impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) derived from \\\\( H(s) \\\\) by the inverse Laplace transform is differentiated with respect to time 't', is the resulting function entirely governed by the constant 'a'?",
  "Explanation": "The differentiation of the impulse response function, which is \\\\( h(t) = e^{at}u(t) \\\\) (where u(t) is the Heaviside step function), results in \\\\( h'(t) = ae^{at}u(t) \\\\). This transformation is directly governed by the parameter 'a', indicating that the cause (differentiation) leads to an effect that is solely dependent on 'a'.",
