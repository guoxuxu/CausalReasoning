  "Problem": "Assume a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\(L[f(t)] = F(s)\\\\) of a function. We are examining the influence of an operation defined by the multiplier \\\\( M(s) = s^n \\\\), where n is an integer, on the transformed function.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional transform \\\\( M'(s) = s^m \\\\) (where m is an integer) is applied as an intervention, will the final result \\\\( L^{-1}[G(s)](t) \\\\) for t > t_1 depend only on the initial \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and not on \\\\( n \\\\) or \\\\( m \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The subsequent intervention with \\\\( M'(s) = s^m \\\\) introduces further modifications, making the final resultant function dependent not only on \\\\( F(s) \\\\) but also significantly on the applied powers \\\\( n \\\\) and \\\\( m \\\\). Each application branches off the resulting function's trajectory, significantly altering its course.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying M'(s) transforms F(s) to G(s), and applying M(s) also transforms F(s) to G(s). The final result G(s) depends on the initial F(s) but not on the specific values of n or m."
