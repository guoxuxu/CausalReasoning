  "Problem": "In the context of signal processing, consider a system where a signal \\( x(t) \\) passes through a linear time-invariant (LTI) system characterized by its impulse response \\( h(t) \\). We study the causal inference of output \\( y(t) \\) resulting from the Fourier Transform \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) applied to \\( x(t) \\) with frequency representation \\( X(\\omega) = \\mathcal{F}\\{x(t)\\} \\) and similarly \\( Y(\\omega) = \\mathcal{F}\\{y(t)\\} = H(\\omega)X(\\omega) \\), where \\( H(\\omega) \\) is the transfer function of the system.\n\nCan we determine the exact form of \\( x(t) \\) purely from \\( y(t) \\) without knowing \\( H(\\omega) \\), by reversing the Fourier Transform \\(\\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the transfer function \\( H(\\omega) \\), it is impossible to uniquely determine \\( x(t) \\) from \\( y(t) \\) since \\( H(\\omega) \\) could modify or attenuate certain frequencies of \\( X(\\omega) \\), and these changes are indistinguishable in \\( Y(\\omega) \\) alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The input signal x(t) Fourier transforms to X(ω), the impulse response h(t) transforms to H(ω), and the product H(ω)X(ω) results in the Fourier transform of the output Y(ω), which inverse Fourier transforms to y(t)."
