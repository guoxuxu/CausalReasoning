  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax \\\\), where A is a constant matrix. Let's explore the effects of an integral transform, specifically the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{x(t)\\\\} = X(s) \\\\), on this system over a period of time t. Analyze how the inverse transform interacts with the system dynamics.\n\nCan we explicitly determine the interventions used (both \\\\( G(s) \\\\) from a Laplace domain and \\\\( H(t) \\\\) from the time domain), by examining \\\\( x(T) \\\\) and knowing it underwent transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact nature and sequence of interventions like \\\\( G(s) \\\\) and \\\\( H(t) \\\\) just from the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is not feasible due to the non-linear interactions and dependencies introduced by these transformations. Different transformation sequences might lead to similar or identical final states due to the overlapping effects.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function x(t) transforms to its Laplace domain representation X(s) through the Laplace transform, and X(s) can be transformed back to the time domain function x(t) via the inverse Laplace transform. The relationship between G(s) and H(t) is implied but not directly causal in this context."
