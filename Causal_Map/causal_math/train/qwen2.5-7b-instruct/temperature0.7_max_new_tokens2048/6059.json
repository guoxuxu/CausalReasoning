  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time evolving according to the system \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + kz \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) as real constants. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-st}z(\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf an intervention is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) where the parameters \\\\( k \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are adjusted to new constants \\\\( k' \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\), will the final outcome of \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) solely depend on the new parameters and not on the original \\\\( k \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) prior to \\\\( t_1 \\\\) influences the integral's value post-intervention. Both the original and the new parameters \\\\( k, \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k', \\\\omega' \\\\) will influence the system's trajectory, hence affecting \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\). The function's history pre-intervention retains an impact due to the cumulative nature of the integral.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The parameters k and ω directly influence z(t), and after time t1, the parameters k' and ω' directly influence z(t). Consequently, z(t) → T(z)(T) implies that the final outcome of T(z)(T) for T > t1 depends on the new parameters k' and ω' rather than the original parameters."
