  "Problem": "Consider a system based on a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) satisfy the coupled differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), and A, B, C, D are constants. We examine the impact of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}[z(t)](s) \\\\) and its inverse on the dynamics of this system.\n\nIf the initial condition is transformed by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) and then allowed to evolve according to the original differential equations without further transformation, does the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend uniquely on the transformed initial condition?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform changes the entire spectral composition of the initial condition, impacting how frequencies evolve over time. Given the system's dynamics involve transformations affecting both the real and imaginary parts, the final state would not only depend on the transformed initial state but also on the interaction between these dynamics over time.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The Fourier transform of the initial conditions of x and y, when evolved according to their respective differential equations, determines the final state of z(T). A and B affect the rate of change of x, C and D affect the rate of change of y, and the Fourier transform of the initial conditions dictates the values of x and y at time T."
