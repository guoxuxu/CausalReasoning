  "Problem": "Consider a linear algebra scenario where the action of a linear transformation \\\\(L\\\\) on a vector space is modified by a function \\\\( g(v) = V^{-1}e^{Dt}Vv \\\\), where \\\\(D\\\\) is a diagonal matrix, \\\\(V\\\\) is the matrix representing a basis transformation, and \\\\(v\\\\) is an arbitrary vector in the space.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(v) \\\\) is applied initially to a vector \\\\( v_0 \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under another linear transformation \\\\( L \\\\) without further intervention, will the resultant vector at time \\\\( t = T \\\\) be equivalent to applying \\\\( L \\\\) first to \\\\( v_0 \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) in the absence of \\\\( g(v) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\\\( g(v) \\\\) changes the vector according to the eigenvalues of \\\\(D\\\\) in the transformed basis, potentially altering the effect of \\\\(L\\\\). The sequence in which these transformations are applied (i.e., \\\\( g(v) \\\\) before \\\\( L \\\\) as opposed to just \\\\( L \\\\)) matters because it affects the combined transformation matrix.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function g(v) transforms the initial vector v_0 into a transformed_vector, which then evolves under the linear transformation L to produce the final_transformed_vector. Without the application of g(v), applying L directly to v_0 would yield the same final_transformed_vector at time T."
