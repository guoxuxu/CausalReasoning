  "Problem": "Assume a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\(L[f(t)] = F(s)\\\\) of a function. We are examining the influence of an operation defined by the multiplier \\\\( M(s) = s^n \\\\), where n is an integer, on the transformed function.\n\nCan we deduce the initial transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) after observing the transformation \\\\( G(s) = s^n F(s) \\\\) at some point without knowing n?",
  "Explanation": "Reconstructing the original \\\\( F(s) \\\\) from \\\\( G(s) = s^n F(s) \\\\) without the exact knowledge of \\\\( n \\\\) is impractical, as multiple potential values of n could fit the same observed modified transform, altering high-order derivative behaviors divergently.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation G(s) = s^n * F(s) shows that G(s) is caused by the multiplication of F(s) with s^n, and s^n influences F(s) through this multiplication."
