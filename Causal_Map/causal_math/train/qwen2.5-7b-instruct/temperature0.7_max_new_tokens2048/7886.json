  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with impedance function \\\\(Z(s)\\\\) in the Laplace domain where \\\\(s\\\\) is the complex frequency. The circuit is initially characterized by an impedance \\\\(Z_1(s)\\\\). An operational intervention modifies the circuit's impedance to \\\\(Z_2(s) = Z_1(s) + \\\\Delta Z(s)\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\Delta Z(s)\\\\) is another impedance term added.\n\nAfter observing the electrical response at time \\\\(t\\\\), can we determine unequivocally that the system's impedance was \\\\(Z_1(s)\\\\) and not \\\\(Z_2(s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the final electrical response only, without specific knowledge of the impedance terms \\\\(\\\\Delta Z(s)\\\\) or if an intervention occurred, it is impossible to conclusively deduce whether the response was due to \\\\(Z_1(s)\\\\) or an altered \\\\(Z_2(s)\\\\). Multiple impedance configurations can produce similar responses under certain input conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
