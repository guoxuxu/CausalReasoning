  "Problem": "Consider a dynamic study involving a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) where A is a complex constant, applied to a complex variable z. We define a transformation using the inverse Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\) on this function and analyze various cases of causal inference.\n\nKnowing the result of \\\\( y(t) \\\\) through \\\\( y(t)=\\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}(e^{Az}) \\\\) at a specific time t, can one infer the value '\\\\' z_0 '\\\\'  if no additional information about the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is given initially?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Laplace transform of \\\\( e^{Az} \\\\) could correspond to various initial values of z due to the complex exponential nature and periodicity in the complex plane. Without explicit information about the initial application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), multiple valid \\\\( z_0 \\\\) values could produce the same observed \\\\( y(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
