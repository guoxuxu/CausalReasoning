  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a periodic input signal \\\\( x(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the signal frequency. The output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) of the circuit is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dy}{dt} + a y = bx \\\\), where 'a' and 'b' are constants.\n\nBased on observing an increase in the steady-state amplitude of \\\\( y(t) \\\\), can we definitively say that the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) was increased?",
  "Explanation": "An increase in the steady-state amplitude could result from changes in the parameters 'a' or 'b' or environmental factors influencing the circuit's response. Without explicit knowledge of these variables or confirmation of their stability, one cannot conclusively link the effect to an increase in \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input signal x(t) directly influences the output y(t), while constants a and b also directly influence y(t). An increase in the frequency ω of the input signal x(t) could potentially lead to an increase in the steady-state amplitude of y(t), but this is not definitively concluded without further analysis."
