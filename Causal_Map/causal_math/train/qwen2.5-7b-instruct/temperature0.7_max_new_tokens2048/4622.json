  "Problem": "Consider an integral transform scenario where \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(t-s)} x(s) ds \\\\) and A is a constant matrix. The function \\\\( x(s) = e^{Bs}y \\\\), where B is another constant matrix and y is a constant vector, is applied to the system, and we are interested in understanding its effects at time T.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can the initial vector \\\\( y \\\\) be uniquely determined without information on the presence or parameters of matrix B?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing B, which critically influences the behavior of \\\\( x(s) \\\\), it is not possible to trace back and uniquely determine \\\\( y \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Matrix B's role in shaping \\\\( x(s) \\\\) is essential in this reconstruction, which would be ambiguous without it.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
