  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant angular frequency. This function describes a circle in the complex plane over time. We investigate the impacts of applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = ze^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant, at different times.\n\nGiven the observed path \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T, can we infer the initial value \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without knowing whether transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing about the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it is impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( z(0) \\\\) because the transformation can modify both the magnitude and phase of the path, leading to multiple potential starting points that could result in the same endpoint at t = T.",
