  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}x(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) satisfies the differential equation \\\\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\\\) with D being a constant matrix. The transformation applied is \\\\( f(x) = Ux \\\\) at time t = 0, where U is a unitary matrix.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we uniquely determine the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether \\\\( f(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(x) \\\\), it is uncertain whether the transformation U was applied, resulting in different potential initial vectors \\\\( x_0 \\\\). The evolution under \\\\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\\\) alone would not be sufficient to backtrack to the unique original state without this knowledge.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state of x(t) at any time t depends on the initial state x(0) through the differential equation. The transformation f(x) applied at t=0 affects x(t). The parameter D governs the evolution of x(t). The value of ω influences z(t) but does not directly affect x(t). Knowing x(t) at t=T allows us to infer x(0) up to a unitary transformation if f(x) was applied."
