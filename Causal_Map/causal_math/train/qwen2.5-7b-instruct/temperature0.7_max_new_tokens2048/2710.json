  "Problem": "Given a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{At}x_0 \\) where \\( A \\) is a constant matrix and \\( x_0 \\) is the initial condition vector in \\( \\mathbb{C}^n \\). Consider applying the transformation by \\( h(z) = e^{Bt}z \\), where \\( B \\) is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf observing \\( z(T) \\) at \\( T \\), can the original vector \\( x_0 \\) be deduced without knowing whether \\( h(z) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the transformation \\( h(z) \\), it’s ambiguous whether the observed \\( z(T) \\) comes from \\( e^{AT}x_0 \\) or \\( e^{BT}e^{AT}x_0 \\). The lack of information about \\( B \\) and the non-trivial interaction between \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) make retracing to \\( x_0 \\) uncertain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition vector x_0 directly influences z(t), which then directly influences z(T). The matrix B directly influences h(z), but this transformation does not affect the ability to deduce x_0 from z(T) if h(z) is known or can be accounted for."
