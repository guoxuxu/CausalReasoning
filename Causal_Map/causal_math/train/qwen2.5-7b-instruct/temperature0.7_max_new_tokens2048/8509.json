  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{y(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), where \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is a time-domain function and \\\\( s \\\\) is the complex variable. We explore the effect of modifying the system using a convolution operation with a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), transforming the original to \\\\( y'(t) = (y * h)(t) \\\\).\n\nIf the convolution with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( y(t) \\\\) to form \\\\( y'(t) \\\\), then is the transformed Laplace \\\\( Y'(s) \\\\) simply the product of the original Laplace transform \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) and the Laplace transform of \\\\( h(t) \\\\), noting \\\\( H(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of a convolution equals the product of the individual Laplace transforms. Thus, \\\\( Y'(s) = Y(s)H(s) \\\\), directly correlating the transformation in the Laplace domain as a multiplication by \\\\( H(s) \\\\).",
