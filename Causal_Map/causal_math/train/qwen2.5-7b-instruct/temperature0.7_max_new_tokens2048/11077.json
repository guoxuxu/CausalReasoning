  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a function \\\\( h(x) \\\\) defined by \\\\( H(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-sx} h(x) dx \\\\), known as the Laplace transform. We analyze the behavior of the function \\\\( h(x) = e^{rx} \\\\) under this transformation, where r is a constant, and how modifications to the function and parameters affect inferences regarding cause and effect.\n\nIf \\\\( h(x) \\\\) as defined above undergoes a Laplace transform to become \\\\( H(s) \\\\), and is further transformed by scaling s by a factor of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) without other intervention, will \\\\( H(\\\\alpha s) \\\\) at transformation \\\\( s = s_0 \\\\) be identical to the directly calculated \\\\( H(\\\\alpha s_0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The property of the Laplace transform with the function \\\\( h(x) = e^{rx} \\\\) ensures linearity, and scaling the transform variable s by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) corresponds directly with this scaling being reflected in the transformed function. Therefore, \\\\( H(\\\\alpha s) \\\\) computed at \\\\( s = s_0 \\\\) is directly equivalent to computing \\\\( H(s) \\\\) at \\\\( s = \\\\alpha s_0 \\\\).",
