  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a matrix differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a constant matrix. We explore the effects of a transformation defined by the matrix function \\\\( g(x) = e^{Mt}x \\\\) over time t, where M is a different constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Qt}x \\\\) (where Q is a constant matrix) is applied, will the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on D and not on M or Q?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention introduces additional complexity via \\\\( h(x) \\\\). The endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) will thus not only depend on D, but also on the effects contributed by the transformations due to M and Q, considering their respective contributions and interactions over the intervals.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
