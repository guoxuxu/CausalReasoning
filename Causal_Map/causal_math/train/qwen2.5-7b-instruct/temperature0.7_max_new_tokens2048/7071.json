  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit governed by the differential equation \\( \\frac{d^2 q}{dt^2} + R\\frac{dq}{dt} + \\frac{1}{L}q = 0 \\), where \\( q(t) \\) is the charge, \\( R \\) is the resistance, and \\( L \\) is the inductance. Let's analyze the effect of introducing a sinusoidal voltage source \\( V(t) = V_0 \\sin(\\omega t) \\) and its impact on the steady-state solution of the system.\n\nIf at a midway time point \\( t_1 \\), we introduce an additional damping factor \\( \\lambda \\) that affects the resistance, \\( R \\rightarrow R + \\lambda \\), will the steady-state of \\( q(t) \\) for \\( t > t_1 \\) depend only on the updated resistance?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with an additional damping factor \\( \\lambda \\) changes the characteristics of resistance, but the steady-state response continues to be a function of both the damped resistance and the parameters of the voltage source \\( V_0 \\) and \\( \\omega \\). Thus, the updated steady-state depends on multiple factors including the original system properties and the intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
