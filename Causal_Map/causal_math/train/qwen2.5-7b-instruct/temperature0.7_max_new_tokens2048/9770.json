  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, and the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), with P being a complex constant. We analyze how a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\), where Q is another complex constant, influences \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time t.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we precisely deduce the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without confirmation on the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), reconstructing \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is ambiguous since both \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\) influence the evolution independently, and their effects are entangled in the resultant state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of P determines the rate of change of z with respect to time; the application of the transformation f(z) influences the observed value of z at time T; knowing z(T) and Q allows us to backtrack to z(0) if the transformation was applied."
