  "Problem": "Consider a scenario involving the continuous mapping of a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\), where a is a real constant, and z represents a complex variable. This function is then subjected to a transformation via a linear operator T that acts as an integral transformation, defined by \\\\( T(f) = \\int_{c-i\\infty}^{c+i\\infty} e^{st} f(1-s) ds \\\\), where c and s are complex variables and t is a real parameter.\n\nIf a new operation, defined by \\\\( g(f) = e^{bz}f(z) \\\\) where b is a new real constant, is introduced as an intervention at some time t = t1, will the function at time t = T (where T > t1) depend solely on the initial function without considering the effects of the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(f) \\\\) introduces a new dynamic to the system via another exponential modification, making the final function at t = T dependent on both the original transformation by T and the intervention, altering the trajectory and output of the function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
