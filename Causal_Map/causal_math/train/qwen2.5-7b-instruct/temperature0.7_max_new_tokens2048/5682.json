  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\( u_t + xu_x = 0 \\), where \\( u(t, x) \\) is a function of time \\( t \\) and space \\( x \\). Investigate the effect of the Fourier transform \\( \\hat{u}(t, \\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-i\\xi x}u(t, x)dx \\) on the system over time.\n\nCan we reconstruct the exact initial function \\( u(0, x) \\) from \\( \\hat{u}(T, \\xi) \\) without knowing whether a Fourier transform was applied at \\( t = 0 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing about the initial Fourier transform, the back transformation might yield erroneous results, particularly considering phase shifts and the possibility of loss of information in frequency space, depending on \\( \\xi \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The change in u over time (u_t) directly causes changes in u. The spatial variable x directly causes changes in the spatial derivative u_x. Applying the Fourier transform directly causes a representation in the frequency domain. The inverse Fourier transform can be used to reconstruct the original function from its frequency domain representation."
