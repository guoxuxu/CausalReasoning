  "Problem": "Analyze a stochastic process where \\\\( X(t) \\\\) evolves according to the stochastic differential equation \\\\( dX = AX dt + BX dW \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constant matrices, and \\\\( dW \\\\) represents the differential of a Wiener process. Consider the effect of the transformation \\\\( f(X) = e^{CX} \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( g(X) = e^{DX} \\\\) (where \\\\( D \\\\) is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the probability distribution of \\\\( X(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( B, C, \\\\) or \\\\( D \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since both \\\\( B, C, \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) influence the dynamics through the transformations and the stochastic nature of the equation, the final distribution is dependent on all matrices. The new transformation adds another layer of complexity affecting the process’s path.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
