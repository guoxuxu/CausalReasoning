  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We analyze the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\omega, t)\\\\) initially and after an intervention defined by multiplying by a modifier function \\\\(m(\\\\omega)\\\\).\n\nIf an intervention function \\\\( m(\\\\omega) \\\\) is applied to the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, t_1)\\\\) at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), modifying the transform as \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, t_1)\\\\cdot m(\\\\omega)\\\\), will the transformed state \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, T)\\\\) for T > t_1 still accurately reflect dynamics governed solely by L?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the frequency components of \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, t_1)\\\\) in a manner that might not align with the natural propagation under L. This misalignment alters the subsequent evolution, making the endpoint \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, T)\\\\) dependent on both the properties of L and the form of \\\\( m(\\\\omega) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "m(ω) → hat{u}(ω, t1); hat{u}(ω, t1) → hat{u}(ω, T); L → u(ω, t); u(ω, t) → hat{u}(ω, t)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the modifier function m(ω) to the Fourier transform \\(\\hat{u}(\\omega, t_1)\\) at time \\(t_1\\) changes \\(\\hat{u}(\\omega, t_1)\\) to \\(\\hat{u}(\\omega, t_1)\\cdot m(\\omega)\\); this change propagates through the evolution governed by L, affecting \\(\\hat{u}(\\omega, T)\\) for T > \\(t_1\\); the linear operator L transforms the state u(ω, t) into its Fourier representation \\(\\hat{u}(\\omega, t)\\), and vice versa."
