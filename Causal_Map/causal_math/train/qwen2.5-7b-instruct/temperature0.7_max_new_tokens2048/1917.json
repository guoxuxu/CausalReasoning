  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = Mz(t) \\\\), where M is a complex matrix. Consider the transformation function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\), wherein N is another complex matrix, and explore the system dynamics under various conditions.\n\nIf the function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to an initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system is allowed to evolve according to \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = Mz(t) \\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be equivalently achieved as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved under \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = Mz(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) to \\\\( z_0 \\\\), we essentially modify the state to \\\\( e^{N0}z_0 = e^{0}z_0 = z_0 \\\\) at t = 0. However, the transformation might influence the rate or direction of evolution under M, affecting outcomes at subsequent times because \\\\( e^{Nt} \\\\) multiplicatively changes the trajectory based on N.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation function h(z) applied to the initial state z(0) at time t=0 results in z(t), which evolves over time according to the differential equation Mz(t) → dz(t)/dt. Therefore, applying h(z) followed by evolution under Mz(t) is equivalent to directly evolving z(0) under the differential equation."
