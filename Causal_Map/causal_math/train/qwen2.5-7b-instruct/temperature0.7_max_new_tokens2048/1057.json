  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function defined on the real axis, \\\\( u(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. This function is transformed using the Laplace transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)dt \\\\).\n\nIf the original function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is transformed using the Laplace transform without any adjustments, will the transformed function only depend on the parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on the variable s?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) results in \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(u)(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), which clearly depends on both the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and the complex variable \\\\( s \\\\). The transformation thus inherently involves \\\\( s \\\\) determining the decay rate and stability of the inverse transform.",
