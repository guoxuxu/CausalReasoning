  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Mx + N \\\\) where \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( x \\\\) is a vector of system states. The system's behavior is analyzed under the influence of a transformation \\\\( h(x) = C e^{Dt}x \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) are also constant matrices.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) is complicated by not knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied. Since both the matrices \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) could have altered the initial state in ways dependent on their compositions and relations to \\\\( M \\\\), tracing back to \\\\( x_0 \\\\) accurately is uncertain without this knowledge.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The matrix M and N determine the rate of change of x, C and D transform x through h(x), and h(x) evolves x over time while the initial state x(0) influences x(t)."
