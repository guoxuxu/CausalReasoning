  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = f(t, z) \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\( f \\\\) involves a mixture of linear algebraic operations and integral transformations. The transformation is defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{T} e^{At} z dt \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix.\n\nKnowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), can we determine whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was also applied at any point, based only on \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resultant state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) may be reached through multiple potential transformations, including different timings or applications of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\). The final state does not uniquely encode information about the specifics of which transformations were applied, due to the non-exclusive influence of the transformations on the system's trajectory.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
