  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2 u}{dx^2} + k^2 u = 0\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a constant. We analyze the impact of the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx}u(x)dx\\\\) on the function \\\\(u(x)\\\\) and its alteration after a transformation defined by \\\\( v(x) = u(x) + ax \\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf at some point \\\\(x_0\\\\), a new function \\\\(w(x) = u(x) + bx^2\\\\) (where \\\\(b\\\\) is another constant) is introduced as an intervention, will the final outcome of the Fourier transform of \\\\(v(x)\\\\) at some range depend only on the original function and not on \\\\(a\\\\) or \\\\(b\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\(w(x)\\\\) as an intervention modifies the original function by adding a \\\\(bx^2\\\\) term, changing the result of the Fourier transform. Both \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) alter the function in ways that affect the outcome of the transformation, not merely depending on the original function \\\\(u(x)\\\\) alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
