  "Problem": "Given a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) where \\\\( t \\\\) is time and \\\\( x \\\\) is a spatial variable. The function is initially defined by the integral transformation \\\\( u(x, 0) = (K * f)(x) \\\\), where \\\\( K \\\\) is a kernel function and \\\\( f \\\\) is an initial function. We study how the transformation evolves under the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\partial_t u = D \\\\partial_{xx} u \\\\), where D is a diffusion coefficient.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention is applied by modifying \\\\( u(x, t_1) \\\\) using another kernel function \\\\( G \\\\) (i.e., \\\\( u(x, t_1) \\\\) becomes \\\\( (G * u)(x, t_1) \\\\)), will the profile of \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be independent of the original kernel \\\\( K \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The second intervention via the kernel \\\\( G \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) adds another layer of transformation on top of the already transformed state. Both the initial kernel \\\\( K \\\\) and the intervention kernel \\\\( G \\\\) influence the subsequent diffusion behavior and thus the profile at time \\\\( T \\\\). This makes the state at \\\\( T \\\\) dependent on both kernels.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u(x, 0) is determined by the kernel K and the initial function f. The evolution of u(x, t) over time depends on the diffusion coefficient D. At time t_1, modifying u(x, t_1) with kernel G changes its value, which may affect the profile of u(x, T) for T > t_1."
