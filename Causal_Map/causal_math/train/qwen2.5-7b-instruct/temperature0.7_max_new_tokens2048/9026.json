  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) where z is a complex variable. We evaluate the function under the transformation defined by the integral \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^z f(u) du \\\\).\n\nGiven the value of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the path taken by z in the complex plane from 0 to z without knowing whether any transformation has been applied?",
  "Explanation": "The value of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) depends on the path of integration in the complex plane. Multiple paths can give rise to the same integral value due to the multi-valued nature of the complex exponential function and potential loops around singularities or branch cuts.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
