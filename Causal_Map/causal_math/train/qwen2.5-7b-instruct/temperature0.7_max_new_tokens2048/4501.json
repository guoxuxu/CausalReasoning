  "Problem": "Evaluate the implication of the Laplace transform on the behavior of an electrical circuit described by the differential equation \\( L\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t) \\), where \\( L \\) is inductance, \\( R \\) is resistance, and \\( V(t) \\) represents a time-varying voltage source. The transformation applied is \\( \\mathcal{L}(I(t)) = \\frac{\\mathcal{L}(V(t))}{sL + R} \\), and we analyze effects and causality with respect to this transform.\n\nIf a specific voltage function \\( V(t) \\) is applied to the circuit at \\( t = 0 \\) and allowed to evolve according to its natural dynamics represented by the differential equation, will the behavior of \\( I(t) \\) solely at any later time \\( t = T \\) be the same as predicted by the transformed equation using \\( \\mathcal{L}(V(t)) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of the equation retains all the information about the system's dynamics under its assumptions. The transform linearly correlates with the time-domain solution of the differential equation, thus ensuring that the behavior predicted preserves causal dynamics from \\( V(t) \\) to \\( I(t) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "V(t) → I(t); L → I(t); R → I(t); sL + R → I(t)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The voltage function V(t) and the parameters L (inductance) and R (resistance) directly cause the current I(t) in the circuit. The expression sL + R in the denominator of the Laplace transform equation influences I(t) through its effect on the transformed voltage function."
