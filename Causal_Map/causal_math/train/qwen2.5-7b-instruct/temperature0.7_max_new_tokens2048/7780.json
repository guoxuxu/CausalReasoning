  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\) and its impact on a domain in the complex plane. We analyze how a Laplace transform, defined as \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), acts on this function.\n\nGiven the modified Laplace transform endpoint \\\\( F(s) \\\\), can we determine what specific functional modification (\\\\( g(z) \\\\)) was applied, solely by analyzing \\\\( F(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the specific modification based solely on \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is generally unfeasible due to the loss of original function characteristics and specific contributions of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) in the transform space. The result \\\\( F(s) \\\\) could potentially be derived from various different modifications, making it difficult to pinpoint which \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was used.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
