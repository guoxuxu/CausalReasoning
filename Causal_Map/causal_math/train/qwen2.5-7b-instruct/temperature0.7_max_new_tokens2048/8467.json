  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) evolving under a system driven by differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Mu \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Nv \\\\), where M and N are constant matrices. An integral transform \\\\( T[w] = \\\\int_0^T e^{-At} w(t) dt \\\\) with a constant matrix A is applied to study the dynamics.\n\nIf an intervention with a new matrix operator \\\\( O \\\\) is applied at a midpoint \\\\( t = T/2 \\\\) to modify both equations to \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Mu + Ou \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Nv + Ov \\\\), will the outcome \\\\( T[z] \\\\) uniquely determine the effects of either M, N, or O?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the operator O modifies the original systems, impacting the evolution of both u and v beyond what would be expected from M and N alone. Since these modifications cumulatively affect the integration result, \\\\( T[z] \\\\) is a compositional outcome of all three matrices (M, N, O), hence not allowing unique attribution of effects to M, N, or O alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "M and N directly cause changes in u and v through their respective derivatives; O modifies u and v through additional terms in their derivatives; the derivatives of u and v directly cause changes in u and v over time; the integral transform T uniquely determines the evolution of z based on the changes in u and v."
