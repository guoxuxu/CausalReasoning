  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a continuous time Fourier transform on a function \\\\( g(t) = e^{-at^2} \\\\), where \\\\( a > 0 \\\\) is a constant, and its interaction with the Laplace transform of the same function. Let \\\\( F(s) \\\\) be the Laplace transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\), and let \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\) be the Fourier transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\).\n\nIf an alteration like \\\\( g(t) = e^{-at^2}t^2 \\\\) is introduced at some point and then Laplace transformation is applied, does the outcome depend solely on parameter \\\\( a \\\\) without being influenced by the Fourier transformation properties?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome after applying the Laplace transform to the altered function does depend on the parameter \\\\( a \\\\) but it's also nuanced by the integral transform properties specific to Laplace, which are different from Fourier. The additional \\\\( t^2 \\\\) term changes the nature of both the function and resultant transform, which cannot be purely correlated to the original Fourier transform properties.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace transform F(s) of g(t) depends on parameter a, while the Fourier transform G(ω) of g(t) also depends on a. An alteration to g(t) such as including t^2 affects both F(s) and G(ω), but the dependency on a remains primary for F(s) and G(ω). The derivative g'(t) influences F(s) and G(ω) but does not introduce new dependencies beyond those already present in F(s) and G(ω)."
