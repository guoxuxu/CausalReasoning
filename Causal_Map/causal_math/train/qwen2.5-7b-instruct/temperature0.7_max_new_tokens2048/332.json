  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where the evolution of a function is described as \\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\), where \\( A \\) is a complex constant and \\( z_0 \\) a complex initial value. Analyze the impact of an integral transformation defined by the operator \\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{Bs}z(s) \\, ds \\), with \\( B \\) also a complex constant.\n\nGiven the final state \\( z(T) \\), can we determine precisely which transformations were applied (whether \\( T(z) \\), \\( H(z) \\), or both) solely by analyzing \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\( z(T) \\) could result from various possible configurations and combinations of \\( T(z) \\) and \\( H(z) \\), influenced by \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\). Given the potential overlap in effects due to integral transformations and complex exponentials, identifying specific interventions definitively is not feasible without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial value z_0, through the action of the constant A, determines the state z(t) at time t. The operator B influences the transformation T(z) via integration from 0 to t, affecting the state through z(s)."
