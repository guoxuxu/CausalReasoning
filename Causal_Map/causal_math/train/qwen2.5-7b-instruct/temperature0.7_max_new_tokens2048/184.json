  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the integral equation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(t-s)}x(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix, and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) describes an input function to the system. We examine the impact of a transformation \\\\( f(x) = Ce^{Dt}x \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) are also constant matrices.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( y(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( f(x) \\\\), \\\\( g(x) \\\\), or both) solely by knowing the outcome \\\\( y(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( y(T) \\\\) can arise from various combinations and sequences of interventions, influenced by non-commutative properties of exponential transformations in \\\\( C, D, F, \\\\) and \\\\( G \\\\). The complexity and potential overlap in effects from different matrix exponentials mean that the precise interventions cannot be uniquely identified from \\\\( y(T) \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
