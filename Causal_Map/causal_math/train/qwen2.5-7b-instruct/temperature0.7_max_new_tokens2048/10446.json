  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), where A, B, C, and D are constants. We explore the impact of a transformation described by \\\\( h(z) = e^{Mt}z \\\\) over time t, where M is a complex constant.\n\nCan the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be inferred from knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\), it is impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) since the transformation \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\) may have altered the initial state in a way that is not straightforwardly reversible, especially if M involves complex components that include rotations.",
