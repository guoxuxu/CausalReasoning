  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), and this function is applied in a complex analysis setting. We explore the role of a contour integral transformation of this function over a closed path in the complex plane.\n\nIs the value of the integral \\\\( \\\\oint_C f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\) around a simple closed contour C that encloses the point z=0 the same as the integral over any other contour that does not enclose z=0?",
  "Explanation": "The integral of \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) over a closed contour that encloses z=0 will pick up contributions from the residues inside the contour. Since e^z is entire and has no singularities, the result will be zero by the Residue Theorem only if no singular points (like branch points or poles) are enclosed by C. Different contours enclose different configurations of singularities.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of the integral of f(z) = e^z over a contour depends on whether the contour encloses z=0. If it does, the value is consistent due to the properties of the exponential function, otherwise, it can vary."
