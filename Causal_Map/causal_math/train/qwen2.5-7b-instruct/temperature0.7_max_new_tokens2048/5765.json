  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and its transformation under the Fourier Transform, \\\\( F \\\\). The Fourier Transform of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is given by \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} g(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier Transform \\\\( F \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any further operation, will the spectrum \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) contain only a single peak at the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform of \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) is a Dirac delta function \\\\( \\\\delta(\\\\omega - \\\\Omega) \\\\) centered at the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). This indicates a single peak at the original frequency without any spread or additional frequencies, as the function is purely sinusoidal.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The function z(t) directly influences the Fourier Transform spectrum hat{z}(ω), and the constant ω directly determines the position of the single peak in the spectrum hat{z}(ω)."
