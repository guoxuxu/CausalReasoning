  "Problem": "Consider a system of equations governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Lx \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. An integral transformation with kernel \\\\( K(t,s) \\\\) is applied to this system resulting in the transformed function \\\\( u(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} K(t,s) x(s) ds \\\\).\n\nGiven the function \\\\( u(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine precisely what kernels were used (whether \\\\( K(t,s) \\\\), \\\\( K'(t,s) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the function at \\\\( u(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) can result from varying contributions of \\\\( x(s) \\\\) under different kernels due to the integral transformation process. This makes it arduous to uniquely determine the kernel or sequence of kernels used from the endpoint alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Knowing the value of u(T) does not allow us to precisely determine which specific kernels K(t,s) or K'(t,s) were used, as u(T) is influenced by both kernels through the integral transformation."
