  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a resistor (R) and an inductor (L) forming an RL circuit, subjected to a voltage \\( V(t) \\) described as a sinusoidal input \\( V_0 \\sin(\\omega t) \\). The response of the circuit is analyzed by examining the current \\( I(t) \\), and we analyze the effect of a transformation \\( f(I) = e^{st}I \\), where \\( s \\) is a complex number.\n\nIf \\( f(I) \\) is applied to the circuit at \\( t = 0 \\), transforming the initial current and then the system is allowed to respond to the input voltage without further intervention, will the current \\( I(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) be the same as if \\( I(t) \\) was allowed to respond from initial conditions without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( f(I) \\) modifies the initial condition of the current, influencing the phase and amplitude of the system's response due to the properties of the exponential transformation under the damped sinusoidal response of the RL circuit. The result is an alteration of the current's behavior over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input voltage V(t) and the resistance R and inductance L directly cause the current I(t). Applying the transformation f(I) → I(t) changes the initial current but does not affect the subsequent response to the input voltage V(t), so the current I(t) at time T will be different if the transformation is applied at t=0 compared to allowing the system to respond from initial conditions without the transformation."
