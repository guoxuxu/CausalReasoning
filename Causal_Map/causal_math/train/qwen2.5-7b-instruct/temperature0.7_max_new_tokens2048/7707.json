  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + L(u) = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. We investigate the behavior when a transformation \\\\( T(u) = u e^{ikx} \\\\) is applied, with \\\\( k \\\\) being a constant and \\\\( x \\\\) the spatial variable.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( S(u) = u e^{-ikx} \\\\) (where \\\\( -k \\\\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( u(T, x) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( L \\\\) and not on \\\\( k \\\\) or other parameters introduced by \\\\( T \\\\) or \\\\( S \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( S(u) \\\\) introduces another transformation, which might cancel or amplify particular effects introduced by \\\\( T(u) \\\\). The final state \\\\( u(T, x) \\\\) at time T will depend significantly on how these exponential factors interact and potentially modify the impact of \\\\( L \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of u over time is governed by L, and transformations T and S modify u but do not introduce parameters that affect the endpoint u beyond those inherent in L."
