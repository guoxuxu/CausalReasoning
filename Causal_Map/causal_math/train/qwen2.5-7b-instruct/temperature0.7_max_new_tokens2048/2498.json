  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a system governed by a vector field \\\\(V(z) = i\\\\beta z\\\\) in the complex plane, where \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) is a real constant. The transformation considered is \\\\(f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a complex constant, and t represents time.\n\nGiven the observed point \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at t = T, can we infer the original point \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether transformation \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "If \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied initially, it alters the magnitude and phase of \\\\(z_0\\\\). Without this knowledge, reconstructing the exact initial point is impossible because multiple initial conditions could yield the same final point dependent on the presence and parameters of \\\\(f(z)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
