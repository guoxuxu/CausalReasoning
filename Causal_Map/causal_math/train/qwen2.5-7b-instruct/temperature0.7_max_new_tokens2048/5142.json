  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving over time governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\), where C is a complex constant. We investigate how the application of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Dt} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where D is a complex constant, affects the system.\n\nCan the initial complex function state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) be precisely inferred from the observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T, without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Reversing the impact of the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) on the state at T to retrieve \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is complicated by the integration and the exponential component \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\), which obscure the original trajectory and state. Without certainty on the application of \\\\( T(z) \\\\), deducing \\\\( z_0 \\\\) accurately is unattainable.",
