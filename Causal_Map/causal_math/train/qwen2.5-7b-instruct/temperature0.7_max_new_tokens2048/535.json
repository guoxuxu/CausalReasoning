  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = h(x, y) = x^3 + iy^2 \\\\) in the complex domain, where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are real numbers. Analyzing this as a complex function involves studying transformations such as \\\\( z \\\\) undergoing a rotation and a stretching described by \\\\( g(z) = e^{At}z \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the original function \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\) and not on \\\\( A \\\\) or the characteristics of \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the additional transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) introduces another level of modification, directly impacting the trajectory of \\\\( z \\\\) beyond just the influence of \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\). Both the rotational-stretching term \\\\( A \\\\) and the characteristics of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) (squaring of the complex number) influence the final endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The endpoint z(T) depends on the initial function h(x, y) through z, the constant A through z, and the time t through z. Additionally, the intervention f(z) directly transforms z. Therefore, for T > t_1, z(T) also depends on the transformation f(z)."
