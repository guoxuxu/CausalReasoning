  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system described by the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number and \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant denoting angular frequency. We explore the impact of an integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{iws}z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely identify the nature of the intervention (either the original trajectory or the altered trajectory with \\\\( c \\\\)) used, based solely on \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from various complex combinations of the initial condition and interventions. Multiple scenarios involving different values of \\\\( c \\\\) could lead to the same resultant state at \\\\( T \\\\) due to the properties of complex exponential growth and superposition, obscuring the exact intervention nature.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The angular frequency w determines the form of z(t), which is influenced by the initial complex number z_0. The integral transform T modifies z(s) over time to produce T[z](t), and the final state z(T) depends on the application of T."
