  "Problem": "Examine the causality in a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + L(u) = 0\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We are considering the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) on the function \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\).\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\(t_1\\\\), an operation described by another transformation, such as a Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\), is applied as an intervention, will the state \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) depend only on L and not on the Fourier or Laplace transforms?",
  "Explanation": "The interventional application of the Laplace transform introduces a new complexity to the system, remodeling the state's spectrum and making the final state \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) dependent not only on L but also on the specific characteristics of both the Fourier and Laplace transforms.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "L influences u(x, t) directly; mathcal{F} and mathcal{L} transformations can affect u(x, t) but do not directly influence the evolution governed by L; thus, u(x, T) at t = T depends on L and not solely on mathcal{F} or mathcal{L}."
