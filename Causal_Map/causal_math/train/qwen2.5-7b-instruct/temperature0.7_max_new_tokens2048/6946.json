  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) applied to a time-dependent signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\), resulting in a transformed signal \\\\( y(t) = z(t) x(t) \\\\). The signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) evolves according to the linear differential equation \\\\( \\dot{x} = Lx \\\\), where L is a linear operator.\n\nGiven the transformed signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at T, can we accurately trace back to the original signal \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was continuously applied or just initially?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the transformation \\\\( z(t) \\\\), whether initially or continuously applied, affects the evolution of the original signal in such a way that without explicit knowledge of its application regime (continuous or initial), determining \\\\( x_0 \\\\) just from \\\\( y(T) \\\\) is not feasible due to the complex interaction between the transformation and the linear operator.",
