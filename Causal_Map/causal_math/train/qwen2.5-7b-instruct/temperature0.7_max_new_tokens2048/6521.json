  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex number. We analyze this function's impact when applied as a transformation within an integral, specifically for the integral \\\\( I = \\\\int_0^T e^{az} \\\\, dz \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant complex number.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to the integral \\\\( I = \\\\int_0^T e^{az} \\\\, dz \\\\) without further modification, will the resultant integral \\\\( \\\\int_0^T e^{a e^z} \\\\, dz \\\\) bear the same value as the original without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) changes the integrand significantly due to the properties of the exponential function in the complex plane, especially as \\\\( e^{ e^z } \\\\) grows much faster than \\\\( e^{z} \\\\), leading to a fundamentally different result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of the integral I is influenced by the constant a and the variable z. Applying the exponential function to z results in e^z, which is then transformed by a to become a * e^z. This transformation is further exponentiated to e^(a * e^z), altering the integrand of the new integral. Therefore, the integral with the transformation, ∫_0^T e^(a * e^z) dz, does not bear the same value as the original integral ∫_0^T e^(a * z) dz."
