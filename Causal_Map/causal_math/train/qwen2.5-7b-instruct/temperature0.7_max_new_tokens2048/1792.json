  "Problem": "Analyze a function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) defined in the complex plane as \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant matrix. The function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bz} \\\\) is considered as an intervention on the system, with \\\\( B \\\\) being another complex constant matrix.\n\nGiven the function value at \\\\( z = T \\\\), can we determine precisely whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) or \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both were applied solely based on the function value at \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The function at \\\\( T \\\\) might be achieved through various pathways involving \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( B \\\\), or combinations of interventions. The nature of matrix exponentiation in the complex domain does not allow reverse engineering the exact sequence of transformations exclusively from the end value.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
