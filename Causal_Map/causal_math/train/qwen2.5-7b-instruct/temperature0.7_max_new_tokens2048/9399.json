  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state. We explore the effect of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another real constant.\n\nIf we apply another transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{iCt}z \\\\) (where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant) as an intervention at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the result at time T (\\\\( T > t_1 \\\\)) only depend on the value A and not on B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) modifies the state at that instant to \\\\( e^{iC(t-T)}z(t_1) \\\\), affecting the final state at time T. Therefore, the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on A, B, and C. The transformations \\\\( e^{iBt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{iCt} \\\\) influence the system in different phases, thereby impacting the ultimate state reached at T.",
