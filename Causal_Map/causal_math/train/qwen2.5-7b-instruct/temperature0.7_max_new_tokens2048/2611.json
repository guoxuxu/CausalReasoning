  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where demand (d) and supply (s) functions for a market are governed by the parameters of a time-dependent differential equation system \\\\(\\\\dot{d} = Ad(t)\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{s} = As(t)\\\\) respectively, with A being a negative constant that controls decay rate. The market is subjected to periodic economic swings described by a function \\\\( f(t) = e^{Bt} \\\\) impacting both supply and demand, where B is a positive constant matrix showing growth over time.\n\nIf an intervention by applying function \\\\( g(t) = e^{-Ct} \\\\) (introducing a counter-balancing decay factor with C as a positive constant) is utilized at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the state of demand and supply at time T > t_1 depend only on the factors A and not on B or C?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing \\\\( g(t) \\\\) as an intervention adds an additional dynamic to the system, making the final states of demand and supply at time T dependent on A, B, and C. The interaction between these factors through exponential growth and decay affects the resultant trajectories, denying a reliance solely on the decay factor A.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state of demand and supply at time T > t_1 depends on A through its effect on both demand and supply, while B and C influence demand and supply initially but their effects are mitigated by the intervention."
