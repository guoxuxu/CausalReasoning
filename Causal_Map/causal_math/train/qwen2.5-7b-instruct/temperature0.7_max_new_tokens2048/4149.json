  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) where \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) are solutions to the differential equations \\( \\dot{x} = Ax \\) and \\( \\dot{y} = By \\) respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. We analyze the impact of a Fourier transform on \\( z(t) \\), defined by \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z\\}(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-ist}z(t) dt \\).\n\nIf \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z\\}(s) \\) is calculated without any modification to \\( z(t) \\), will the outcome at frequency \\( s \\) be solely dependent on the properties of matrices A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) captures the frequency components inherent to the functions \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\), which are solely governed by matrices A and B respectively. The outcome at any specific frequency \\( s \\) in \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z\\}(s) \\) will directly reflect the characteristics of A and B as long as no modifications or interventions are applied to \\( z(t) \\).",
