  "Problem": "Assume a linear transformation in a vector space governed by the matrix equation \\\\( x'(t) = Lx(t) \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear operator. We are considering the impact of applying another linear operator transformation defined by \\\\( F(x) = Mx \\\\) at time t=0, where \\\\( M \\\\) is also a linear operator.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing the system at \\\\( x(T) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( F(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( F(x) = Mx \\\\) was applied, it's impossible to recover the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\). The application of \\\\( M \\\\) could have altered the initial condition in a manner irreversibly combined with the evolution under \\\\( L \\\\), especially as \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( L \\\\) can be fundamentally different.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state of the system at time t (x(t)) is causally influenced by the linear operator L through the differential equation Lx(t) → x'(t). Applying the operator F at t=0 with M transforms the initial state x(0) → Mx(0). Without knowledge of whether F was applied, deducing the original vector x(0) from x(T) is not possible."
