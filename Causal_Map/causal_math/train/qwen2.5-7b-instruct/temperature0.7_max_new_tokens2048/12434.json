  "Problem": "Consider the impact of a linear operator transformation on a Fourier series representation of a function. Let \\\\( g(x) = \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} a_n e^{inx} \\\\), and the transformation is defined by \\\\( T(g(x)) = \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} b_n a_n e^{inx} \\\\), where \\\\( b_n \\\\) are coefficients modifying the Fourier coefficients \\\\( a_n \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional transformation \\\\( T'(g(x)) = \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} c_n b_n a_n e^{inx} \\\\) (where \\\\( c_n \\\\) are new coefficients) is applied as an intervention, will the final spectral properties at \\\\( t_2 > t_1 \\\\) depend only on the initial coefficients \\\\( b_n \\\\) and not on \\\\( c_n \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional transformation with new coefficients \\\\( c_n \\\\) further modifies the Fourier coefficients, thus making the final state at \\\\( t_2 \\\\) dependent on both the initial transformation by \\\\( b_n \\\\) and the subsequent transformation by \\\\( c_n \\\\). The changes induced by \\\\( c_n \\\\) cannot be ignored in determining the final spectral properties.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation T applied to g(x) results in g'(x), which depends on the coefficients b_n. The additional transformation T' applied to g(x) results in g''(x), which depends on both b_n and c_n. The final spectral properties at t2 depend on both the transformations T and T', thus they depend on both b_n and c_n."
