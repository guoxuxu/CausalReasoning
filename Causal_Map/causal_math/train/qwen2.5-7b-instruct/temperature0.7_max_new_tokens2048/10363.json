  "Problem": "Imagine a continuous system defined by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. Consider the Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) = \\\\hat{u} \\\\) as a transformation that acts on the state variable u.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( G(u) = \\\\sqrt{\\\\hat{u}} \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the state at \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the operator L and not on the Fourier transform or the intervention G?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( G(u) \\\\) introduces an additional modification by manipulating the spectral components of \\\\( u \\\\). Hence, the outcome \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) depends significantly on both the original Fourier transform and the subsequent intervention as well as the operator L.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
