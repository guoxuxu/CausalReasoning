  "Problem": "Given a linear operator L operating on a space of functions, consider how the Fourier transform interacts with differential operators. Let L be defined specifically for a function u(x) such that Lu = -u''(x) where ' denotes the derivative with respect to x.\n\nGiven the function \\( v(t) \\) at t = T, can we deduce precisely what the original function u(x) was at t = 0 without knowing if the Fourier transform was used?",
  "Explanation": "Even if it is known that L has operated on \\( u(x) \\), without confirmation if a Fourier transform or some other transformation was applied, reversing to the exact state of \\( u(x) \\) at t = 0 is highly uncertain. The changes induced by L and potential lack of information about initial Fourier transform application introduce significant ambiguity.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The linear operator L applied to u(x) results in -u''(x), and the value of v(t) at t=T is related to the value of u(x) at t=0 through the Fourier transform, but without knowing if the Fourier transform was used, we cannot precisely deduce u(x) at t=0."
