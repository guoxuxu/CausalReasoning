  "Problem": "Consider the control of a heat equation \\\\( u_t = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta u \\\\) on a domain, where \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is a thermal diffusivity constant and \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) denotes the Laplacian. An intervention involves changing boundary conditions at a specific time using a function \\\\( h(t,x) = e^{\\\\lambda t}g(x) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is a spatial function.\n\nIf at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new boundary condition function \\\\( k(x) \\\\) is enforced as an intervention, will the end distribution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) and not on the initial boundary conditions influenced by \\\\( h(t,x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) will influence the solution, but the overall thermal distribution at T will also depend on the effects contributed by the original boundary conditions via \\\\( h(t,x) \\\\). The heat distribution follows the cumulative effect of all boundary conditions and the inherent properties dictated by \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\).",
