  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by Laplace's equation in a complex domain, \\\\( \\\\Delta u = 0 \\\\), for a function \\\\( u: \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\). We investigate the effect of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) applied to an initial condition \\\\( u_0(z) \\\\), evaluated at complex number z, and how its impact is observed over space without and with additional transformations.\n\nIf at a complex position \\\\( z_1 \\\\), a new intervention by a transformation \\\\( T(u) = e^{ikz}u \\\\) (where k is a real number) is applied, does the resultant field \\\\( u(z) \\\\) at any z only depend solely on the impact of Laplace's equation and not on the Fourier or the new intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( T(u) \\\\) at \\\\( z_1 \\\\) introduces another complex exponential shift which interacts with both the Fourier transformed initial state and the Laplace equation dynamics. Thus, the resultant field \\\\( u(z) \\\\) is influenced by the initial Fourier transform, the Laplace's propagation, and the new exponential intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of u at any z depends on the solution of Laplace's equation Δu → u, the initial condition u_0(z) → u, the transformation T(u) → u, and the Fourier transform → u, but the impact of the new intervention T(u) = e^{ikz}u is integrated within the overall solution."
