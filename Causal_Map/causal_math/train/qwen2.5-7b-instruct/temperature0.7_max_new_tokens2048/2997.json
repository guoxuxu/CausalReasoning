  "Problem": "Investigate the scenario where a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) defined as \\\\( z(x) = e^{Cx} \\\\) where C is a constant matrix, is integrated into the dynamic determined by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dx}u(x) = Du(x) \\\\), D being another constant matrix. Analyze the evolution when the transformation \\\\( g(x) = z(x) * u(x) \\\\) is introduced.\n\nIf \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is applied to an initial condition \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at x = 0, and then the system evolves under \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dx}u(x) = Du(x) \\\\) without further manipulations, will the state \\\\( u(x) \\\\) at x = X be the same as if the initial condition \\\\( u_0 \\\\) directly evolved to x = X under \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dx}u(x) = Du(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) redefines the initial state by multiplying each component by \\\\( e^{Cx} \\\\), which modifies the trajectory of the system. Since the exponential function can alter the dynamics significantly depending on C relative to D, the resulting state at any later time x = X will differ.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The exponential function z(x) determines the transformation g(x), which modifies the initial condition u_0 to evolve under the differential equation D → d/dx[u(x)]. The state u(x) at x = X after applying g(x) is influenced by both the transformation and the original dynamics, potentially differing from the state u(x) at x = X if u_0 had directly evolved under D without the transformation."
