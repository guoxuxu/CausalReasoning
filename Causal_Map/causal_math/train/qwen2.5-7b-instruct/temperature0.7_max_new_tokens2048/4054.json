  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + A \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} = 0 \\\\), where A is a constant. We explore the behavior of the system under the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t, x)\\\\} = U(s, x) \\\\) and the subsequent inversion to the time domain.\n\nIf given \\\\( U(s, x) \\\\), the Laplace transform of \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\) for some t > 0, can we determine the original initial function \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The inversion process from the Laplace transform domain to the time domain requires knowledge of the entire spectrum of s-values and appropriate behavior at infinity. Additional conditions at boundaries or specifics on singularities would be necessary, meaning \\\\( U(s, x) \\\\) alone is insufficient for a unique determination of \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace transform U(s, x) of u(t, x) at some t > 0 provides information about u(t, x), which can be inverted to recover u(t, x) from its initial condition u_0(x), assuming no additional information is required."
