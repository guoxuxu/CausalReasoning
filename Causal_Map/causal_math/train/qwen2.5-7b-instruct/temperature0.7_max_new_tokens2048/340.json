  "Problem": "Examine a scenario involving a wave equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} = \\\\frac{1}{c^2}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2}\\\\), where c is the wave speed. Let the transformation \\\\(f(u) = u \\\\cdot e^{\\\\lambda t}\\\\) be applied, where \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) is a constant.\n\nFrom observing the final state at t=T, can we ascertain precisely which transformations (whether \\\\(f(u)\\\\), \\\\(g(u)\\\\), or both) were applied, given only the state of the wave at t=T?",
  "Explanation": "The effects of transformations \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\) on the wave amplitude could be compounded or negated depending on their values and timing, making it impossible to uniquely deduce the sequence or type of interventions merely from the end state, due to the overlapping effects on the wave’s amplitude.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The original wave function u directly influences the transformed function f(u) through the transformation f, and similarly, u directly influences the transformed function g(u) through the transformation g."
