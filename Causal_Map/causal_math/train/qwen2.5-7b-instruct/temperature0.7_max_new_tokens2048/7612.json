  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\(z(t)\\) described by the differential equation \\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\omega z\\), where \\(i\\) is the imaginary unit, and \\(\\omega\\) is a real constant frequency. Now analyze the impact of the integral transformation defined by \\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{-i\\omega s}z(s)ds \\) over time \\(t\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\( T(z(T)) \\), can we determine precisely which transformations were applied (whether \\( T(z) \\), \\( Q(z) \\), or both), solely based on \\( T(z(T)) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations \\( T(z) \\) and \\( Q(z) \\) potentially overlap in how they process the input \\( z(t) \\). Since \\( T(z(T)) \\) is a result of integrating with exponential weighting factors, it could feasibly be reached through various combinations of \\( T(z) \\) and \\( Q(z) \\), or even other similar transformations. Consequently, \\( T(z(T)) \\) alone does not allow us to uniquely identify which transformations were applied.",
