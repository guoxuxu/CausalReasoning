  "Problem": "Consider the evolution of a complex function \\\\( w(z) \\\\) in a domain \\\\( D \\\\) under transformation by integration against a kernel function \\\\( K(z, s) \\\\), where \\\\( z, s \\\\) are complex variables. The transformation is described by \\\\( w'(z) = \\\\int_D K(z, s) w(s) ds \\\\). Assume that \\\\( K \\\\) modifies how the function behaves in the domain differently based on its parameters.\n\nSuppose at a certain point, an additional kernel transformation \\\\( K_2 \\\\) is applied as an intervention. Will the subsequent state of \\\\( w(z) \\\\) for any \\\\( z \\\\) in \\\\( D \\\\) depend only on the original kernel \\\\( K \\\\), ignoring effects of the new kernel \\\\( K_2 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a new kernel transformation \\\\( K_2 \\\\) acts as an intervention that modifies the development trajectory and state of \\\\( w \\\\) within the domain. The final state of \\\\( w(z) \\\\) will be influenced by the effects of both \\\\( K \\\\) and \\\\( K_2 \\\\), thus not solely dependent on the original kernel.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The subsequent state of w(z) (w'') depends on the original kernel K through the intermediate state w'(z), and also directly depends on the new kernel K_2. Therefore, the effect of K_2 is not ignored but integrated into the computation of w''."
