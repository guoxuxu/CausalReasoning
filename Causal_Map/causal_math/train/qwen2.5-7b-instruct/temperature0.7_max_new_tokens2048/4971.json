  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant complex matrix. We evaluate the impact of the Fourier Transform and its inverse defined by the function \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-2\\\\pi i \\\\xi t} z(t) dt \\\\) and \\\\( F^{-1}(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{2\\\\pi i \\\\xi t} z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention which is represented by another transform, say \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-3\\\\pi i \\\\xi t} z(t) dt \\\\), is applied, will the final state at t = T only depend on the dynamics represented by \\\\( A \\\\), and not on the initial Fourier Transform?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( G(z) \\\\) adds a new dimension to the transformation, mixing frequency components in another manner. The final state at t = T will therefore depend not just on \\\\( A \\\\) but also on how \\\\( F(z) \\\\) and \\\\( G(z) \\\\) interact and alter the trajectory in the complex-frequency domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z(t) at any time t depends on the constant complex matrix A. The Fourier Transform F converts z(t) into Z(ξ) in frequency domain, while the transform G converts z(t) into Z'(ξ) in a different frequency domain. The final state at t = T depends solely on the dynamics represented by A, independent of the initial Fourier Transform F."
