  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We investigate how the integral transformation \\\\( F[z(t)] = \\int_0^T e^{-Ct}z(t) \\, dt \\\\), with C as another constant matrix, impacts this system over time T.\n\nAssuming a new matrix D is introduced at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) altering the system into \\\\( F[z(t)] = \\int_{t_1}^T e^{-Dt}z(t) \\, dt \\\\), will the outcome of \\\\( F[z] \\\\) for T > t_1 solely depend on A and B without influence from C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( D \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) modifies the weighting function, significantly affecting how the trajectory data from \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is accumulated and thus altering the integrated result. Both C (up to \\\\( t_1 \\\\)) and D (after \\\\( t_1 \\\\)) influence the outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The matrices A and B directly cause changes in x(t) and y(t) respectively. The matrices C and D indirectly influence F[z(t)] through the integral transformations, but after the introduction of D at time t_1, the outcome of F[z] for T > t_1 will primarily depend on A and B."
