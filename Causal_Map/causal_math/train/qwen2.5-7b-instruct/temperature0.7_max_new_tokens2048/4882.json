  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number, defining a rotation in the complex plane with time. Let's study the system under a transformation specified by the operator \\\\( L \\\\) taken as a Fourier transform, denoted by \\\\( F[\\\\cdot] \\\\).\n\nCan we determine the original starting phase of \\\\( z(0) \\\\) after observing the Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a later time \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) will provide information about the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) but loses information about the initial phase. Since the spectrum only contains frequency information, the original phase at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined.",
