  "Problem": "Examine the causal relationship in a scenario where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) undergoes various transformations. Initially, we have a Fourier transform applied to the signal, \\\\( F(x)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega t} x(t) dt \\\\). Afterwards, we evaluate the impact using a filter function \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\), which might be an intervention in the frequency domain.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( F(x)(\\\\omega) \\\\) is applied to signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\), and subsequently left to evolve naturally without further transformation, will the final frequency response be influenced merely by the inherent properties of \\\\( x(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without any subsequent transformation or filtering, the frequency spectrum derived from the Fourier transform \\\\( F(x)(\\\\omega) \\\\) purely reflects the intrinsic properties of the original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\). There is no extrinsic influence altering the result.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
