  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a function over the complex plane given by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_C g(s) e^{zs} ds \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a contour in the complex plane, and \\\\( g(s) \\\\) is a complex-analytical function. We examine the effects of modifying the function \\\\( g(s) \\\\) by a factor \\\\( h(s) \\\\), thus making it \\\\( g'(s) = g(s)h(s) \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain point we introduce an additional modifying function \\\\( k(s) \\\\) applied specifically at a single value of \\\\( s_0 \\\\), will the resulting \\\\( F(z) \\\\) be solely dependent on the initial form of \\\\( g(s) \\\\) and not on \\\\( k(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing the function \\\\( k(s) \\\\) affects the integrand at \\\\( s_0 \\\\) and modifies the integral computation. This intervention affects the outcome of \\\\( F(z) \\\\), hence making it dependent not only on \\\\( g(s) \\\\) but also on \\\\( k(s) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Modifying g(s) to g'(s) through h(s) affects F(z); introducing k(s) specifically at s0 modifies g'(s) but does not solely depend F(z) on the initial form of g(s) without considering the impact of k(s)."
