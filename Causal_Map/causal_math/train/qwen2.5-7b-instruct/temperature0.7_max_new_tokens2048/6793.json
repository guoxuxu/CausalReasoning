  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. A transformation \\\\( h(x) = T^{-1}e^{Dt}Tx \\\\) is considered, where T is an invertible matrix and D is a diagonalizable matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) changes the starting vector, altering the trajectory under the system's dynamics. Since \\\\( h(x) \\\\) applies an exponential operation that modifies the phases and growth rates different components of \\\\( x \\\\), the state at time T will generally be different unless \\\\( T^{-1}e^{Dt}T \\\\) commutes with \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation h(x) to x_0 at t=0 and allowing it to evolve under \\(\\dot{x} = Mx\\) results in the same state x(t) at t=T as directly evolving x_0 to t=T under \\(\\dot{x} = Mx\\), given that T and D are appropriately chosen."
