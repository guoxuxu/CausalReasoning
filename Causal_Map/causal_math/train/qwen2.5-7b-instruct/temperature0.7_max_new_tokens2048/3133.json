  "Problem": "Consider a physical system governed by the wave equation in a one-dimensional domain, defined as \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) describes the displacement at position \\\\( x \\\\) and time \\\\( t \\\\), and \\\\( c \\\\) is the wave speed. We explore the effect of applying the Fourier transform to the initial conditions.\n\nIf a non-zero initial condition \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) is Fourier transformed to \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,0) \\\\), and then the system is allowed to evolve according to the wave equation without further intervention, will the transformed state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) still satisfy the wave equation?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the initial conditions converts the problem into the frequency domain, where each frequency component evolves independently according to the wave equation. The evolution in the frequency domain still obeys the transformed wave equation, indicating that the causal dynamics are preserved even after the Fourier transform.",
