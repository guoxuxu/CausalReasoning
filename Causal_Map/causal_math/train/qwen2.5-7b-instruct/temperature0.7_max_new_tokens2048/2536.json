  "Problem": "Consider complex function \\\\(g(z) = e^{\\lambda z}\\\\) where \\\\(z\\\\) represents complex numbers and \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) is a complex constant. We examine how integral transformations, specifically Laplace Transform, modify this function and impact the final output when the independent variable \\\\(z\\\\)'s real part changes.\n\nGiven the complex transformed function \\\\(H(s)\\\\), is it possible to uniquely determine the parameters \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) solely from \\\\(H(s)\\\\) without additional information about the original form of \\\\(z\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed function \\\\(H(s)\\\\) may exhibit multiple possible combinations of \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) that fit the same resulting transformation due to the overlapping characteristics of cosine and exponential functions in the Laplace domain. Without clear distinguishing features attributable explicitly to either parameter, it's challenging to pin down their exact values uniquely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The real part of z influences H(s), which in turn determines both omega and lambda."
