  "Problem": "Assume a function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) represents a complex-valued function where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time. This function is transformed by a complex exponential \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number.\n\nGiven the observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely calculate what interventions were used (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) merely from knowing the final state?",
  "Explanation": "Determining which interventions were used based solely on the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is not feasible. Multiple combinations of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), or their sequences can lead to identical or indistinguishable effects at T due to the properties of exponential transformations in the complex plane. This non-uniqueness in trajectory outcomes inhibits precise inference of the interventions.",
