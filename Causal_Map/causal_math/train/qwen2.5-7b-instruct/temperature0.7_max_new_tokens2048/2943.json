  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations given by \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), where A is a matrix and b is a vector. We investigate the influence of a transformation \\\\(f(x) = Mx + c\\\\), where M is another matrix and c is a constant vector, on the solution x.\n\nIf at some intermediate time \\\\(t_1\\\\), another transformation \\\\(g(x) = Nx + d\\\\) (where N is a constant matrix and d is a vector) is applied as an intervention, will the final solution vector \\\\(x(T)\\\\) depend only on A and not on M, N, or their constants c, and d?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(g(x) = Nx + d\\\\) introduces additional factors that alter the equation to \\\\(A(Nx + d) = b\\\\), which depends critically on the values of N and d, in addition to the initial transformation by M and c. As a result, the final state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) depends on these matrices and vectors, altering the solution path.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation f(x) directly influences the state of x at time t1, while the transformation g(x) directly influences the final state x(T) at time T. The matrix A directly causes the solution x(T), and the matrices M, N, and vectors c, d only affect the state at time t1."
