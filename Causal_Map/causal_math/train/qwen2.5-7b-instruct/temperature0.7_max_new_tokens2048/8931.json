  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Qz \\\\), where Q is a constant complex matrix. We examine the impact of the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Pt}z \\\\) over time t, where P is another constant complex matrix.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention with a new function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\) (where R is a constant matrix) is applied, will the resulting value \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on Q and not on P or R?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of the intervention via \\\\( h(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\) introduces additional complexity into the system, making the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) a result of influences from Q, P, and R. Both the pre and post intervention transformations have a significant impact on the final state at T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z(T) depends on the initial condition z(t_1) at time t_1, which is influenced by P; however, once z(t_1) is determined, further changes due to R do not affect z(T) if the transformation h(z) starts at t_1. Q influences z(T) through the differential equation but is independent of P and R after t_1."
