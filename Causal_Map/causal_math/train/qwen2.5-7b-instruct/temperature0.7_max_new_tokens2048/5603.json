  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system where the state vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx + u \\\\), with D being a constant matrix and u representing external control influences. We study the system behavior under the intervention of a transformation \\\\( g(x) = e^{Ft}x \\\\), where F is another constant matrix.\n\nIf a new function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Gt}x \\\\) (where G is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention at a later time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the end state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), for T > t_1, depend only on D and not on F or G?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the second intervention with \\\\( h(x) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces additional modifications to the system's trajectory, dependent on the matrices F and G as well as D. These interventions, represented by the matrix exponentials, each contribute to shaping the final state at time T. The result at time T is influenced by the compositional effects of these transformations and cannot be determined solely by D.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
