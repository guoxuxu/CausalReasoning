  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), governed by the system of differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We apply a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) over time t, where C is a diagonal matrix representing an integral transform.\n\nCan the original complex state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be precisely deduced after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing if transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it is uncertain if the observed dynamics were solely due to the natural evolution under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\) or modified by \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\), as C could introduce changes in amplitude and phase not accounted for by A and B.",
