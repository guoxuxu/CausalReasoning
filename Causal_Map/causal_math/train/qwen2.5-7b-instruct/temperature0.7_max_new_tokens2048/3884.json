  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by a complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iAz \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real scalar. The system's evolution is assessed with and without the application of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another real scalar.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can result from various initial conditions and interventions due to the superposition principle in complex functions. The phase changes induced by \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) may cause similar final states under different scenarios, obscuring which specific transformations were applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z(T) is influenced by the initial condition z(0), the rate of change of z given by iAz, and the transformation g(z) applied over time t."
