  "Problem": "Analyze the stability of a system governed by a matrix equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\) where M is a matrix with eigenvalues. To study this system, a transformation \\\\( z = T^{-1}x \\\\) is applied, where T is a transformation matrix, converting the system to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Jz \\\\) with J being the Jordan form of M.\n\nIf an intervention modifies matrix M to matrix N at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), and the system's evolution is recalculated from \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be solely dependent on the original matrix M?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the governing matrix from M to N, thus the future system dynamics post-intervention depend on the properties of N. The behavior prior to \\\\( t_1 \\\\) under M might influence the conditions at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), but the final state at T > t_1 is largely dictated by N.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The original matrix M directly influences the state x, which through transformation T becomes z. The matrix N, resulting from modifying M, directly influences the state x at times greater than t1. The Jordan form J, derived from M, indirectly influences z."
