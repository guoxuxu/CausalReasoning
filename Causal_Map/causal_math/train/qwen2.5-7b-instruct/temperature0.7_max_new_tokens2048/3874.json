  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system characterized by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We investigate the effect of the operator \\\\( F(x) = S^{-1}e^{Kt}Sx \\\\) over time t, where K is another diagonalizable matrix and S is the transformation matrix that diagonalizes D.\n\nCan we infer the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( F(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about the application of \\\\( F(x) \\\\), it's unclear whether the observed trajectory results from the natural evolution under D or the modified pathway due to \\\\( F(x) \\\\). The existence of the transformation matrix S and the matrix K complicates back-calculating to the exact initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\).",
