  "Problem": "Consider a linear system modeled by the equation \\(dz = Pz \\, dt\\), where \\(P\\) is a constant matrix. Investigate the implications of applying the transformation \\( g(z) = e^{Qt}z \\) over time \\(t\\), with \\(Q\\) also being a constant matrix.\n\nIf at time \\( t_1 \\), we apply another intervention \\( h(z) = e^{Rt}z \\) (where \\( R \\) is another constant matrix), does the resulting state \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) rely only on \\( P \\) and not \\( Q \\) or \\( R \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The interventional application of \\( h(z) \\) at \\( t_1 \\) introduces an additional altering vector flow. Consequently, the final state \\( z(T) \\) will be a function of \\( P \\), \\( Q \\), and \\( R \\). The transformations \\( e^{Qt} \\) and \\( e^{Rt} \\) affect the system's trajectory, imparting dependency from all matrices.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of z over time depends directly on P through the differential equation dz/dt = Pz, while transformations g(z) and h(z) apply changes at specific times but do not alter the long-term dependency of z on P."
