  "Problem": "Analyze the effects of replacing a matrix A in a linear system \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) with a new matrix \\\\(A' = A + B\\\\), where B introduces a perturbation. Let the initial condition be \\\\(x_0\\\\) and consider the effect of operator \\\\(f(x) = e^{Bt}x\\\\) over time.\n\nGiven the state \\\\(x(T)\\\\), can we determine the initial condition \\\\(x_0\\\\) without knowing if the transformation \\\\(f(x)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the transformation \\\\(f(x)\\\\) influences the trajectory such that without this knowledge, multiple initial conditions could yield the same \\\\(x(T)\\\\). The effect of \\\\(B\\\\) makes it impossible to uniquely determine \\\\(x_0\\\\) since the eigenstructure of \\\\(B\\\\) might not be inferable from \\\\(x(T)\\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
