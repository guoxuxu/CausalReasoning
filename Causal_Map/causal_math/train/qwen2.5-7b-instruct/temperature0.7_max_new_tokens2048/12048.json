  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(t) \\) that represents a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\), which undergoes a transformation given by the Laplace transformation \\( \\mathcal{L} \\). We examine how this transformation affects the causal relationship between time-domain and frequency-domain representations.\n\nIf the complex function \\( z(t) \\) is transformed into the frequency domain by the Laplace transformation \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) at time \\( t = 0 \\), will the output \\( \\mathcal{L}(z(t)) \\) uniquely represent the function \\( z(t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transformation \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) of \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\) uniquely transforms the time-domain function into a frequency-domain representation. The transformation, being linear and injective for such functions, preserves the uniqueness and details of \\( z(t) \\) in the transformed output.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
