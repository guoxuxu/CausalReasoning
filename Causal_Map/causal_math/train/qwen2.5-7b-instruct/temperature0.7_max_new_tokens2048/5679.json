  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) that governs the temperature distribution in a rod, modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where k is a constant. We consider the impact of an initial condition modification \\\\(u(x, 0) = h(x)\\\\) and the application of a transformation \\\\(u(x, t) = v(x, t) + w(x, t)\\\\), where \\\\(v(x, t)\\\\) solves the original PDE and \\\\(w(x, t)\\\\) is another function introduced as an intervention.\n\nIf at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) an intervention modifies the temperature distribution by adding a function \\\\(w(x, t_1)\\\\) to \\\\(u(x, t_1)\\\\), will the final state \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) for T > t_1 reflect only the properties of the natural heat transport governed by the heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by adding \\\\(w(x, t_1)\\\\) alters the path of the system, affecting the subsequent distribution and making the final state dependent not only on the natural properties of the heat equation but also on the characteristics of the intervening function \\\\(w(x, t_1)\\\\).",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition h(x) influences u(x, t) through the solution v(x, t) of the heat equation. An intervention w(x, t_1) added at time t_1 modifies u(x, t_1) to affect u(x, t) for t > t_1. Thus, the final state u(x, T) for T > t_1 reflects both the natural heat transport properties and the intervention."
