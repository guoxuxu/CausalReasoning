  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a resistor (R) and an inductor (L) forming an RL circuit, subjected to a voltage \\( V(t) \\) described as a sinusoidal input \\( V_0 \\sin(\\omega t) \\). The response of the circuit is analyzed by examining the current \\( I(t) \\), and we analyze the effect of a transformation \\( f(I) = e^{st}I \\), where \\( s \\) is a complex number.\n\nIf at a specific time \\( t_1 \\), an intervention by another transformation \\( g(I) = e^{Ct}I \\), where \\( C \\) is another complex number, is applied, will the resulting current \\( I(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) be independent of \\( s \\) from \\( f(I) \\) and only dependent on the system dynamics?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention using \\( g(I) \\) adds another complex exponential factor influencing the system’s behavior, and as such, the resultant current \\( I(T) \\) will depend on both \\( s \\) and \\( C \\) and their interaction with the natural response of the RL circuit, changing the overall response.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Voltage V(t) and resistance R and inductance L directly cause current I(t). Transformations f(I) and g(I) both modify current I(t) to result in I(T) for T > t_1, with I(T) being primarily influenced by system dynamics rather than the specific transformations f(I) and g(I)."
