  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\( U_{xx} = -\\\\lambda U \\\\) where \\\\( U(x, t) \\\\) is a function of space x and time t, and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant. Study the effects of applying a Fourier transform over space, resulting in the transformed function \\\\( \\\\hat{U}(k, t) \\\\), and analyze its behavior under the spatial transform \\\\( G(k) = e^{-\\\\alpha k^2 t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is another constant.\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\( \\\\hat{U}(k, t) \\\\), can we determine if the transform \\\\( G(k) \\\\) was applied at the initial time t = 0 with absolute certainty, knowing only \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) but not \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), it's impossible to determine if the spatial transform \\\\( G(k) \\\\) was applied, as it could merely be part of the natural evolution of the system under the given differential equation, especially if transformations yielding a similar decay in terms of k due to conditions at time t = 0 could be misconstrued as the effect of \\\\( G(k) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
