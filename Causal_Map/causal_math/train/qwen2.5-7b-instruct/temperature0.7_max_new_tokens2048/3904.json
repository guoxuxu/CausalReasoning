  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined on the complex plane, \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant matrix and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( F[z] = \\\\int e^{iBt}z(t)\\\\, dt \\\\) over time interval [0, T], where \\\\( B \\\\) is also a constant matrix.\n\nKnowing the final result of \\\\( F[z] \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\), can we unambiguously ascertain which transformations (either \\\\( F \\\\), \\\\( G \\\\), or both) had been applied during the interval [0, T]?",
  "Explanation": "The end result of \\\\( F[z] \\\\) provides insufficient detail to distinctly confirm the type or sequence of transformations due to the overlapping effects of exponential matrix functions in the integrals. The potential for various combinations leading to the same final state implies ambiguity in recovering precise intervention details.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
