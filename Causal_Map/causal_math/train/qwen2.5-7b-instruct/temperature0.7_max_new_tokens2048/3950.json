  "Problem": "Analyze the impact of performing a sequence of linear transformations and then applying a Laplace Transform L on a function g(t), where g(t) = e^(At)x for a constant matrix A and an initial vector x.\n\nAfter obtaining L{g(t)} = (sI - A)^-1 * x from the transformation of g(t) = e^(At)x, can we uniquely determine x without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the initial vector x or additional constraints or information about the matrix A, the results from the Laplace Transform do not necessarily provide enough data to uniquely reverse and find x. If A is not invertible or has other specific characteristics, it could impede the unique determination of x.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Performing a sequence of linear transformations and then applying the Laplace transform L on g(t) results in L{g(t)}. The matrix A directly influences g(t), and the vector x also directly influences g(t). The expression sI - A directly leads to (sI - A)^-1 * x."
