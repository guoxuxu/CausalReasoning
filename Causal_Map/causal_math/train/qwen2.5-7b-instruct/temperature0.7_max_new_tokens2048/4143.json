  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. The system is further studied under the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is another constant.\n\nIf a different transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a constant) is applied as intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T be purely governed by the original equation without being affected by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) further complicates the evolution, introducing additional growth factor \\\\( e^{\\\\beta (T-t_1)} \\\\). Hence, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on both the effect of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) from \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) from \\\\( h(z) \\\\), alongside the natural evolution due to \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). As such, the determination of the state at \\\\( T \\\\) must consider all three parameters, making the trajectory and final state a result of this composite influence.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of z with respect to time is directly influenced by iω, while the transformations g(z) and h(z) are functions of α and β respectively, applied at specific times. The final state z(T) at time T is directly influenced by the initial conditions and the differential equation, independent of α and β after the interventions."
