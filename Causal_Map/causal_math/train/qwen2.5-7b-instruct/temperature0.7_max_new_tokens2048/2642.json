  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = h(x, y) = x^2 + iy^2 \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are real numbers and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The behavior is studied under the transformation \\\\( T(x, y) = (e^x, e^y) \\\\) on the complex function.\n\nCan we determine the original inputs \\\\( (x_0, y_0) \\\\) after observing the output of \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\) if \\\\( T(x, y) \\\\) was applied, without knowing the specific values of \\\\( x_0, y_0 \\\\) originally?",
  "Explanation": "Given the output of the transformed function, we cannot uniquely determine \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and \\\\( y_0 \\\\) due to the nature of the exponential function and the squaring in \\\\( h \\\\). Multiple pairs \\\\( (x_0, y_0) \\\\) may yield the same output under these transformations, particularly considering the mix of real and imaginary components.",
