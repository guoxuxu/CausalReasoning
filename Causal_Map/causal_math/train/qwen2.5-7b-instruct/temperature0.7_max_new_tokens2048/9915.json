  "Problem": "Consider a set of complex-valued functions defined in the complex plane and the application of the Laplace transform, which is represented by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\). Analyze the behavior and relationships when these functions are subjected to transformations like multiplication by a constant or modification by an exponential decay factor.\n\nIf at a certain time the function is modified by a scaling factor K (constant), and transformed again using \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), will the resultant transform strictly depend only on the original function \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} \\\\) and not on the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The scaling intervention modifies the function to \\\\( K e^{at} \\\\). The Laplace transform of this new function is \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(K e^{at})(s) = \\\\frac{K}{s-a} \\\\), which clearly shows a dependency on the scaling factor K. Therefore, the outcome in the transform domain depends on both the original function and the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "A scaling factor K directly modifies the function f(t), resulting in a new function L. The Laplace transform of L, denoted as M, depends on the original function f(t) and the scaling factor K, while the exponential factor a within f(t) influences the form of F(s) and G(s)."
