  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) evolve over time according to the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + By\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy\\\\), with constants A, B, C, D. We examine the role of an integral transformation, \\\\(T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{st}z(s) ds\\\\), applied to z(t).\n\nGiven the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations were applied (whether \\\\(T(z)\\\\), \\\\(S(z)\\\\), or both), by only observing the result at \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining exact interventions used on \\\\(z(T)\\\\) from the final state alone is not feasible. The complex interaction and integrative nature of both transformations, T(z) and S(z), can lead to similar outcomes under different combinations, especially due to the overlapping effects and non-unique solutions of the integral transformations in complex function dynamics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
