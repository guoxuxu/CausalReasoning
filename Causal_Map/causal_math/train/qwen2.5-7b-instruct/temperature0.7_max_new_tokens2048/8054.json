  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t, governed by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\). The functions are subjected to transformation through an integral operator \\\\( T \\\\), such that \\\\( Tz(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{C(s-t)}z(s)ds \\\\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the observation of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T, can we determine the original complex function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without knowing whether transformation \\\\( T \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The non-trivial nature of the integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\), which involves a matrix exponential function, masks the original state from which \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolved. The effect of the transformation depends on both the history of the function and the matrix C, complicating the backward inference of \\\\( z(0) \\\\) simply from observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
