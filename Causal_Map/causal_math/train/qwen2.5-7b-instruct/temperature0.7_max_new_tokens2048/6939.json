  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. The system undergoes a Fourier transformation \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) dt \\\\), which modifies its spectral components.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{Ct}z(t) dt \\\\) (where C is a constant matrix) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the spectrum \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at time \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) solely depend on the transformations by A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( G(z) \\\\) introduces modifications to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that also depend on C along with A and B. This adds complexity to the system's dynamics and affects its frequency-domain representation, hence \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at times after \\\\( t_1 \\\\) will reflect the influences of A, B, and C.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "x(t) → z(t); y(t) → z(t); A → x(t); B → y(t); F(z) → spectrum; G(z) → spectrum; t1 → application of G(z)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of x(t) and y(t) is directly influenced by matrices A and B respectively. The spectrum F(z) is modified by the Fourier transformation and is independent of the additional transformation G(z) applied after time t1. Thus, the spectrum F(z) at time t > t1 depends solely on the transformations by A and B."
