  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), representing a complex exponential function. This function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is mapped through a complex transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\), where \\\\( n \\\\) is a positive integer. We explore the dynamics of this transformation over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention applies a second transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^m \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resulting state at any \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) still only depend on the initial function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and the first transformation \\\\( f \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing the second transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^m \\\\) modifies the trajectory of the system, and hence the final state at any \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) will depend on both transformations \\\\( f \\\\) and \\\\( g \\\\), their specific order and their respective powers \\\\( n \\\\) and \\\\( m \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "z(t) → f(z); z(t) → g(z); f(z) → h(z); t1 → g(z); h(z) → z(T)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial function z(t) influences both transformations f(z) and g(z); the first transformation f(z) leads to h(z); the second transformation g(z) at time t1 modifies z based on the state after f; the resulting state z(T) depends on the combined effect of f and g applied up to time T."
