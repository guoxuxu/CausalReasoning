  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real parameter representing angular frequency. The function describes a pure harmonic oscillation in the complex plane. Now, consider the transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf a new transformation \\\\( k(z) = z^3 \\\\) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), where \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), will the waveform at time \\\\( T \\\\) still reflect only the original harmonic motion influenced by \\\\( \\omega \\\\) without the transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Applying a new transformation \\\\( k(z) \\\\) introduces another layer of complexity, modifying the waveform further to triple the original frequency starting from \\\\( t_1 \\\\), which makes the resulting state at \\\\( T \\\\) dependent on the initial angular frequency and effects of both \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( k(z) \\\\). This results in an evolution completely different from the natural harmonic motion.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of transformations h(z) = z^2 and k(z) = z^3 to z(t) = e^(iωt) will alter the waveform's form but not its fundamental harmonic nature represented by ω. Therefore, at time T, the waveform will still reflect the original harmonic motion influenced by ω, despite the transformations applied at t1."
