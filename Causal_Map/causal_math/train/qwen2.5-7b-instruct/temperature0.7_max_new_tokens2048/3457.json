  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}x \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) is a constant complex number and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. The function maps to the transformation with integral transformation operator \\\\( T \\) defined as \\\\( T[f](s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\, dt \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any modification, will the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) be solely dependent on the original parameters \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T[z(t)] \\\\) will result in \\\\( Z(s) = x / (s - i\\omega) \\\\), which depends strictly on the initial parameters \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\), following the direct application of the Laplace transform to the exponential function.",
