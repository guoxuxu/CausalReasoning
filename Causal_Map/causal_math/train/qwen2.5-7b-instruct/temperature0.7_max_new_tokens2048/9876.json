  "Problem": "Consider a control system characterized by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu\\\\), where A is a constant matrix and B is a control matrix. An integral transformation with kernel K(x, s) is applied to the state x, yielding a transformed state \\\\(z(t) = \\\\int_0^t K(x(s), s) ds\\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at time T, can we determine exactly which control matrices (B or C) influenced the state, assuming both were potentially used?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific influences of B or C solely from z(T) is challenging due to their combined effects on the state x(t) and subsequently on z(T). The overlap of their impacts and the integral transformation’s cumulative nature obscure their individual contributions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
