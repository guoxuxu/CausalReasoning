  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical environment where a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) undergoes a transformation through a linear time-invariant system described by its impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\). The system's transfer function is \\\\( H(s) \\\\), and the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is applied.\n\nIf the system is given an initial input \\\\( z(0) \\\\) and the transformation \\\\( L(z(t)) = Z(s) \\\\) (Laplace of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)) is applied with no further modification, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T reflect solely the input modification by \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the system is linear time-invariant, the output at any time point T, represented by \\\\( z(T) \\\\), will solely depend on the convolution of the input and the system's impulse response transformed by \\\\( H(s) \\\\). The Laplace transform applied to input \\\\( z(t) \\\\) aligns exactly with the system's transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial input z(0) influences z(t) over time, which is then transformed into Z(s) via the Laplace transform. The transfer function H(s) modifies Z(s) to produce z(T) at time T."
