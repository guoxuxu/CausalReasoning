  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of real variable t, governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = -y \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = x \\\\). We examine modifications introduced by a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we identify which transformations were used (\\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) based solely on knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can be achieved through various combinations of transformations with \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) depending on the times they were applied and their respective frequencies. The effects of these transformations on z's trajectory can be overlapping or nullifying, making it impossible to determine exactly which interventions were employed.",
