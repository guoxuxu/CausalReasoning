  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution in a rod, denoted by \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\), is governed by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. To study the effects of external factors, an intervention is modeled by multiplying the initial temperature distribution by a function \\\\(h(x) = e^{-ax}\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant.\n\nCan we conclusively determine the original temperature distribution \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) at \\\\(t = 0\\\\) after observing the temperature \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\), without knowing if \\\\(h(x)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the function \\\\(h(x)\\\\) was applied, the altered initial conditions due to the multiplicative intervention affect the inference of \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) based solely on the observation at time \\\\(T\\\\). There are multiple potential initial distributions that could result in the same observed distribution at time \\\\(T\\\\), depending on whether and how \\\\(h(x)\\\\) was applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
