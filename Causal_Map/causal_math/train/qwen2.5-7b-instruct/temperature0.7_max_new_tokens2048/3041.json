  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\) applied to a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) which evolves by the system \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = kz \\\\), with k being a complex constant. This problem examines how transformations and system dynamics interact over time.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = kz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T remain purely dependent on the evolution under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = kz \\\\), unaffected by \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state to \\\\( e^{i\\\\theta}z_0 \\\\). The evolution under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = kz \\\\) from this modified initial condition results in \\\\( z(T) = e^{kT}e^{i\\\\theta}z_0 \\\\), which differs by a complex phase factor e^{i\\\\theta} from the direct evolution \\\\( e^{kT}z_0 \\\\). Thus, \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends significantly on the initial transformation by \\\\( g(z) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
