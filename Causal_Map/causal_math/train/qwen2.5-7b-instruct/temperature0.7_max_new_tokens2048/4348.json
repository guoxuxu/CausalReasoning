  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\omega\\\\) is a fixed frequency. The effect of an integral transformation \\\\(T[f](s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt\\\\) is examined over this function, both with and without additional transformations.\n\nKnowing the output of the transformation \\\\(T[z](s)\\\\) after applying the damping intervention, can we uniquely determine the values of both \\\\(\\gamma\\\\) and \\\\(\\omega\\\\) from the form of the output alone?",
  "Explanation": "Since the output form \\\\(\\frac{1}{s+\\gamma - i\\omega}\\\\) can be achieved with various combinations of \\\\(\\gamma\\\\) and \\\\(\\omega\\\\) balancing each other, it's impossible to uniquely determine both values without additional context or constraints, as the parameters are intertwined in the transformed expression.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
