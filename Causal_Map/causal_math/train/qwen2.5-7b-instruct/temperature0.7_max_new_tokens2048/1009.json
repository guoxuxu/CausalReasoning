  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t is a real number representing time. We are analyzing how the Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t}dt \\\\) affects our understanding of the function's behavior over time.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) represents the input to a system with a response characterized by its Fourier transform, does the integral transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) for a fixed \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) capture all variations of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) results in \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = 2\\\\pi \\\\delta(\\\\omega - 1) \\\\), which captures the dominant frequency component at \\\\( \\\\omega = 1 \\\\) but does not encode temporal variations beyond the identified frequency. This means transient behaviors or changes in amplitude are not captured.",
