  "Problem": "Consider the relationship between a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) and its corresponding Laplace Transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\). Here, \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), respectively.\n\nIf a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is defined without any modification and the Laplace Transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) is computed, does \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) inherently consider both components \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) in the transformation process?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform of a complex function \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t) + iv(t)\\\\} \\\\) inherently involves both the real part \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and the imaginary part \\\\( v(t) \\\\) of the function. The transformation results encapsulate both components together, converting time-domain information into the frequency domain, which inherently considers both.",
