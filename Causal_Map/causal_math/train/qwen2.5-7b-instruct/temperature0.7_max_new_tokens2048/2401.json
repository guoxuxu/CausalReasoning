  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\) in which \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing a trajectory in the complex plane. We are given that the trajectory evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Az \\\\) where A is a complex constant. We also consider the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) where B is another complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to an initial point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Az \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to \\\\( t = T \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Az \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( e^{B0}z_0 = z_0 \\\\), but the ongoing influence of \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) continuously changes the trajectory from what would have been under only \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Az \\\\), leading to a position at \\\\( t = T \\\\) that depends on both A and B.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial point z_0 directly influences z(t). The constant A directly influences z(t). The constant B does not directly influence z(t) because g(z) is only applied once at t=0 and then the evolution is governed solely by A."
