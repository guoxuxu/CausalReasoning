  "Problem": "Analyze the impact of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = te^{it} \\\\) on a real signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) through the convolution integral \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(s) z(t-s) ds \\\\). Here, \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit.\n\nAfter observing a resultant signal post application of potential interventions (\\\\( z(t) \\\\), \\\\( w(t) \\\\), or both), can we unequivocally determine the underlying signals or interventions applied simply based on the observed frequencies in \\\\( y(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the resultant signal's complexity and the non-trivial effects of convolution and additional interventions, it is impossible to distinctly discern which interventions were applied or decompose their independent impacts on the resultant signal by observing it at any point.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The complex function z(t) and the real signal x(t) each contribute to shaping the resultant signal y(t) through the convolution process."
