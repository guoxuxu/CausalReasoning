  "Problem": "Consider a linear algebra problem where a system is transformed by the matrix function \\\\( f(x) = Mx \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is an invertible matrix. The system's behavior and outcomes are then studied under the transformation \\\\( g(x) = Nx \\\\), where \\\\( N \\\\) is another matrix, to observe the evolution of the system over time.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( h(x) = Lx \\\\) (where L is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on N and not on M or L?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) will depend on M, L, and N. The sequence in which these matrices are applied, and their properties will influence the final state of the system. Matrices M, L, and N may not commute, and therefore the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is contingent on the order and nature of these transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
