  "Problem": "Consider a linear system of equations represented by \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a matrix and \\\\(b\\\\) is a vector. We introduce a transformation \\\\(T(x) = Mx\\\\) where \\\\(M\\\\) is also a matrix that modifies the system prior to solving for \\\\(x\\\\).\n\nKnowing the final solution \\\\(x''\\\\) to the system after applying \\\\(M\\\\) and \\\\(N\\\\) (transformed to \\\\(ANMx = b\\\\)), can we determine the sequence or type of transformations applied (whether \\\\(M\\\\), \\\\(N\\\\), or both), without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the precise transformations or their sequence from the final solution \\\\(x''\\\\) is infeasible without more data. The matrices \\\\(M\\\\) and \\\\(N\\\\) could have interacting effects that mask their individual contributions, especially if their multiplicative effects are non-distinct in the resultant system.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
