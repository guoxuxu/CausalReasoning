  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation in two dimensions \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 \\phi = 0\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\phi(x, y)\\\\) is a scalar potential field. We explore the effects of a transformation defined by \\\\(g(\\\\phi) = \\\\phi + \\\\sin(x + y)\\\\) introduced at a specific location in the domain.\n\nGiven the modified potential \\\\(\\\\phi'(x, y) = \\\\phi(x, y) + \\\\sin(x + y)\\\\) at some point in the domain, can we uniquely determine the original potential \\\\(\\\\phi(x, y)\\\\) without intervention information?",
  "Explanation": "Yes, provided the transformation is known (\\\\(\\\\sin(x+y)\\\\) is added), one can subtract \\\\(\\\\sin(x + y)\\\\) from the observed modified potential to retrieve the original potential field \\\\(\\\\phi(x, y)\\\\) governed by the Laplace equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation g applied to the potential field φ results in the modified potential φ', and the term sin(x + y) directly contributes to this modification."
