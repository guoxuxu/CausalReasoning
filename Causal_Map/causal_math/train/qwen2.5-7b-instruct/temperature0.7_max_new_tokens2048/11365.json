  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a stochastic differential equation \\\\(dx = (Ax + u)dt + BdW\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\) are constant matrices, \\\\(u\\\\) is a control input, and \\\\(dW\\\\) represents the increment of a Wiener process. We analyze how the output function \\\\( f(x) = Cx \\\\) behaves under different conditions, where \\\\(C\\\\) is a constant matrix outputting the observable state.\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( x_0 \\\\) of the system is perturbed and evolved under the given stochastic differential equation without further control input changes \\\\( u = 0 \\\\), will \\\\( f(x(t)) \\\\) at time \\\\( t = T \\\\) be linearly dependent on \\\\( f(x_0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the control input \\\\( u \\\\) remains zero and the matrix \\\\( A \\\\) governs the autonomous system's dynamics linearly, the output \\\\( f(x(t)) = Cx(t) \\\\) remains linearly related to \\\\( f(x_0) = Cx_0 \\\\) due to the linearity of matrix multiplication and the solution path of the differential equation. Noise induced by \\\\( dW \\\\) affects the magnitude but preserves linear dependency.",
