  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\) evolving under the dynamics described by \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Pz\\\\), where \\\\(P\\\\) is a complex constant. The impact of applying the transformation \\\\(g(z) = e^{Qt}z\\\\) over time \\\\(t\\\\), where \\\\(Q\\\\) is another complex constant, is analyzed.\n\nIf a new function \\\\(h(z) = e^{Rt}z\\\\) (where \\\\(R\\\\) is a constant complex matrix) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) depend solely on \\\\(P\\\\) and not on \\\\(Q\\\\) or \\\\(R\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(h(z)\\\\) introduces additional dynamics, affecting the trajectory and final state of \\\\(z(T)\\\\). Both \\\\(Q\\\\) and \\\\(R\\\\), alongside \\\\(P\\\\), influence the final outcome through their combined effects on the evolution process.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
