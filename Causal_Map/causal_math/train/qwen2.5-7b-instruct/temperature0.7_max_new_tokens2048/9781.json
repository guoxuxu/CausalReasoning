  "Problem": "Consider a stochastic process \\\\( X(t) \\\\) defined by the stochastic differential equation \\\\( dX = AX dt + B dW(t) \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( dW(t) \\\\) represents the differential of a Wiener process (Brownian motion). We examine the effect of the transformation \\\\( f(X) = X e^{Ct} \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf transformation \\\\( f(X) \\\\) is applied to a state \\\\( X_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( dX = AX dt + B dW(t) \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( X(t) \\\\) at t = T equal the evolution of \\\\( X_0 \\\\) to t = T under \\\\( dX = AX dt + B dW(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(X) = X e^{Ct} \\\\) alters the initial state, which in turn affects the trajectory under the stochastic process. The introduction of \\\\( C \\\\) adds a new exponential factor which influences the volatility and mean of the process, resulting in a distinct trajectory at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
