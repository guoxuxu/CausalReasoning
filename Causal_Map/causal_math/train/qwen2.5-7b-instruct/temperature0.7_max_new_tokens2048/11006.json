  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant. The system undergoes analysis under the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nKnowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowledge about the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, it's impossible to accurately trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The transformation could have altered the initial state by any complex scaling factor \\\\( e^{kT} \\\\), making it infeasible to determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) uniquely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Given z(T) and knowing the transformation f(z) = e^(kt)z, we can determine z_0 by reversing the transformation. Since t → z(T) and k → f(z), then z_0 = z(T) * e^(-kt)."
