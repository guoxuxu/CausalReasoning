  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i \\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant. We assess the impact of the transformation \\( g(z) = e^{\\alpha t}z \\) over time t, where \\( \\alpha \\) is a complex constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0 after observing \\( z(t) \\) at t = T without knowing whether \\( g(z) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about the application of \\( g(z) \\), the observed \\( z(t) \\) could be the result of different initial conditions altered by \\( e^{\\alpha t} \\). Since the exponentiation can introduce significant changes depending on \\( \\alpha \\), \\( z_0 \\) cannot be uniquely determined from \\( z(T) \\) without that knowledge.",

List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
