  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_t + a u_x = 0 \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant. We analyze the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T[u](x, t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-ks} u(x, s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant.\n\nCan we deduce the exact form of \\\\( u(x, 0) = u_0(x) \\\\) after observing \\\\( T[u](x, T) \\\\) for some T > 0, without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( T[u] \\\\) was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\( T[u](x, T) \\\\) integrates the effects of the initial function \\\\( u_0 \\\\) over time with an exponential weighting. As this blending obscures direct characteristics of \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\), it's not possible to uniquely regress to the initial condition without knowledge of whether \\\\( T \\\\) was applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The time derivative of u (u_t) and the spatial derivative of u (u_x) influence T[u], while the initial condition u_0(x) determines the value of u at any later time, and T[u](x, t) reflects the state of u at time t."
