  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real-valued functions satisfying the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), respectively. A transformation function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) is examined, where \\\\(C\\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then it evolves under the system described by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to what would have been obtained if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) significantly alters the initial conditions. Since \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) affects both real and imaginary components differently, depending on C, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will likely differ from the untransformed trajectory.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial value of z at t=0 (z(0)) directly influences z at time t (z(t)). Similarly, the initial values of x and y at t=0 (x(0) and y(0)) directly influence x and y at time t (x(t) and y(t)). The transformation function f(z) applied at t=0 modifies z(0) to z(0)', and without further intervention, z(0)' evolves to z(T) according to the given differential equations."
