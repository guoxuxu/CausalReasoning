  "Problem": "Consider an integral transformation on a complex function defined as \\\\(T(x) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} x(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex number. This transformation represents a Laplace transform that is widely used in solving differential equations and analyzing systems. The goal is to explore the manipulation and impacts of such transforms in various configurations, considering intervention by a differential operator.\n\nKnowing the result of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), is it possible to determine uniquely that the original function was \\\\( x(t) = e^{at} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform is unique, meaning that a given transform result corresponds to one specific original function under the condition that the original function meets the criteria for transformation, thereby accurately tracing back to \\\\(x(t) = e^{at}\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace transform T(x) of a function x(t) can be 1/(s-a), which suggests that the original function x(t) could be e^(at). However, this is not unique since other functions could also have the same Laplace transform."
