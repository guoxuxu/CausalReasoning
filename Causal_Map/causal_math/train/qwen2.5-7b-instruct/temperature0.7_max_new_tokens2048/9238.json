  "Problem": "Investigate a system subjected to the Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = F(s) \\\\) and its inverse, influencing a time-dependent function \\\\( g(t) \\\\). The function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is initially impacted by a transformation \\\\( h(t) = t^2 g(t) \\\\) and analyzed for causality and effects of transformations.\n\nKnowing the Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) at some s = a, can we reliably deduce the original form of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) without knowing whether the square transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( t^2 \\\\) alters the frequency-domain characteristics significantly. Without knowledge of the specific transformation applied, the inverse Laplace transform would not uniquely revert to the original \\\\( g(t) \\\\), but rather to the modified \\\\( t^2 g(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
