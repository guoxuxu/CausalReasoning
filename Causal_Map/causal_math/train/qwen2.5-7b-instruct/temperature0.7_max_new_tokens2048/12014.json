  "Problem": "Consider a scenario involving a function f(z) in the complex plane, where \\\\( f(z) = e^{kz} \\\\) and k is a real constant. We explore the implications of modifying this function via a linear transformation \\( T(z) = az + b \\) where a and b are complex constants.\n\nIf an intervention is applied by inserting an additional transformation \\\\( U(z) = cz + d \\\\), where c and d are complex constants, does the outcome at \\\\( z \\\\) depend solely on the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and not on \\\\( T(z) \\\\) or \\\\( U(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( U(z) \\\\) as an intervention significantly affects the final outcome since the resultant transformation will be dependent on the interaction among f, T, and U. The complex plane transformation properties ensure that the result is not solely determined by \\\\( f(z) \\\\) but influenced by each transformation’s specific role and composition order.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
