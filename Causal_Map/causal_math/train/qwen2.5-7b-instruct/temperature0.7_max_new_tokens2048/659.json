  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function f(z) defined on the complex plane, governed by the differential equation \\\\( f'(z) = az^2 + bz + c \\\\) where a, b, and c are complex constants. We analyze the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{z} f(t) dt \\\\) applied to this system.\n\nIf a new transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{dz} \\\\) (where d is a complex constant) is applied at a point z midway through evolution, will this intervention affect the final form of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) as evaluated from the initial point without considering future transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Applying a transformation like \\\\( h(z) = e^{dz} \\\\) modifies the evolution trajectory of the original function f(z) by altering its values post-intervention. This change will propagate to the integral transformation g(z), influencing the integrated sum and consequently the final output of the complex integral transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The derivative of f with respect to z influences g(z), which in turn is affected by the constants a, b, and c. The constant d influences h(z), and h(z) subsequently affects g(z)."
