  "Problem": "Consider a nonlinear system controlled by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = r(t)e^{i\\\\theta(t)} \\\\), where \\\\( r(t) \\\\) is the amplitude and \\\\( \\\\theta(t) \\\\) is the phase. A transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = ze^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) with a complex constant \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is considered over time t.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied at t = 0 to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and the system is then allowed to evolve under its own dynamics without further intervention, will the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time T match the evolution of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) not transformed by \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = ze^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) changes the initial condition by modifying both the amplitude and phase of \\\\( z_0 \\\\). Hence, the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from that new initial condition will be altered both in growth rate and rotation, leading to a different state at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation f(z) to the initial state z_0 at t=0 changes z(t) such that for t > 0, z(t) does not match the evolution of z_0 without the transformation."
