  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) governed by the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} + k^2 u = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant. An integral transformation, specifically the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), is applied to \\\\( u(x) \\\\) resulting in \\\\( U(k) \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\( U(k) \\\\) at later time T, can we determine whether the constant \\\\( k \\\\) was changed at some point during the evolution, only based on \\\\( U(k) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Though the Fourier transform carries significant information about \\\\( u(x) \\\\), the exact history of parameter changes such as modifications of \\\\( k \\\\) is not decodable from \\\\( U(k) \\\\) alone without additional contextual data about times and nature of interventions.",

List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of k directly influences the form of the PDE, which in turn affects the Fourier transform U(k)."
