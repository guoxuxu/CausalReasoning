  "Problem": "Consider a function represented in the complex plane as \\\\(f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z}\\\\), which is transformed by the integral \\\\(g(z) = \\\\int_{C} \\\\frac{e^{zt}}{z} dz\\\\), where C is a contour in the complex plane that encircles the origin once and t is a parameter.\n\nKnowing only \\\\(g(z)\\\\) at a general t, can we deduce the t value for which the transformation was initially computed?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transform introduces an exponential factor that depends on t, and distinguishing between different values of t from the knowledge of \\\\(g(z)\\\\) alone may be indistinguishable unless further details of the original form or specific integration path are known.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
