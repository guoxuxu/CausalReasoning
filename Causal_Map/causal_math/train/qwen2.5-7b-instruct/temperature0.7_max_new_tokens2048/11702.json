  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of \\\\( t \\\\), and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the impact of the Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(z(t))(s) \\\\) on the function, shaping how it evolves over time.\n\nKnowing the transformed function \\\\( F(s) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any additional information or intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform is a bijective (one-to-one and onto) linear transformation for functions satisfying certain growth conditions. Therefore, knowing \\\\( F(s) \\\\) allows for the unique reconstruction of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) through the inverse Laplace transform.",
