  "Problem": "Imagine a system where we want to study heat transfer in a rod governed by the heat equation \\\\(u_t = k u_{xx}\\\\) where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity of the material. We analyze the scenario where at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), a temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) = u_0(x) \\\\) is initially applied, and then see its evolution or the effects of interventions.\n\nIf the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) is given as a Gaussian distribution, and the system is left to evolve according to the heat equation without any intervention, will the profile at a later time \\\\( t = T \\\\) still be Gaussian?",
  "Explanation": "The heat equation’s solution with a Gaussian initial distribution remains Gaussian at any later time. This self-similarity arises due to the nature of the Gaussian function being a solution to the Fourier transform used in solving the heat equation.",
