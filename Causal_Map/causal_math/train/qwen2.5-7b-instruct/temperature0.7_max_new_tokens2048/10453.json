  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We look into the effect of a transformation described by \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) applied to the complex plane.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied initially to \\\\( z(0) \\\\), then allowed to evolve according to \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) without any additional intervention, will the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be the same as if no transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) initially squares the complex number, changing the trajectory path. The transformation modifies the magnitude and the frequency of oscillation of the trajectory, making it distinct from the unmodified path.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial value z(0) directly influences the trajectory z(t) through the function z(t) = e^(it), and this trajectory evolves continuously to z(t+Δt). Applying the transformation h(z) = z^2 to z(0) changes the initial condition but does not alter the continuous evolution described by z(t) = e^(it), so the overall trajectory will differ if h(z) is applied."
