  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{wt} \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. Study the impact of an integral transformation given by \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant, and T is the upper limit of integration.\n\nCan one specify which parts of the interval experienced modifications in \\\\( w \\\\) based only on the data at T resulting from \\\\( G(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation accumulates effects over the entire interval without distinguishing specific temporal segments independently. Knowledge of \\\\( G(z) \\\\) results alone does not permit back-tracking to determine precise times or natures of interventions; it provides a compounded measure of all dynamics within the entire integration period.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
