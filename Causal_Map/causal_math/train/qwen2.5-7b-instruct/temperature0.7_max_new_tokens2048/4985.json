  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear transformation \\\\( L(z) = Cz \\\\) in the complex domain, where C is a constant complex matrix. Analyze the consequences of applying a transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dz}z \\\\) over complex variable z, with D being another constant complex matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at the beginning, and then \\\\( z \\\\) evolves under \\\\( L(z) = Cz \\\\) without further interventions, will the state of \\\\( z \\\\) at a later time be identical to evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\( L(z) = Cz \\\\) directly?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) changes the initial state by applying the exponential function \\\\( e^{Dz} \\\\), which can modify the trajectory of \\\\( z \\\\) under the transformation \\\\( L(z) = Cz \\\\). The presence of matrix D alters the initial conditions and dynamics, resulting in a different endpoint.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying h(z_0) results in z, which then evolves under L(z) = Cz to produce the state of z at a later time, equivalent to directly evolving z_0 under L(z) = Cz."
