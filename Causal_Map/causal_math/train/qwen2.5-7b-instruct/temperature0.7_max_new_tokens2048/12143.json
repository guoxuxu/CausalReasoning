  "Problem": "Imagine a system governed by the Laplace Transform, \\\\( L(f)(s) \\\\) of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\. We apply the Laplace Transform to the exponential growth function \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real constant. We then examine how an intervention using the Fourier Transform, \\\\( F(g)(\\\\omega) \\\\), affects the transformed function \\\\( f(t) \\\\).\n\nKnowing the final Laplace spectrum after interventions, can we precisely determine what specific parameters or types of Fourier Transform were applied?",
  "Explanation": "The modified spectrum can stem from various parameters settings of the Fourier Transform due to its effect on the frequency domain. Different settings may produce similar modifications in the time-domain function that result in the same or indistinguisthable Laplace spectra. Hence, pinpointing the exact intervention parameters solely from the Laplace spectrum is infeasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
