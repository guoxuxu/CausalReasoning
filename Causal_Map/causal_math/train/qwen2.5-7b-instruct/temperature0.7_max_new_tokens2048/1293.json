  "Problem": "Given a linear operator L operating on a space of functions, consider how the Fourier transform interacts with differential operators. Let L be defined specifically for a function u(x) such that Lu = -u''(x) where ' denotes the derivative with respect to x.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\( F[u(x)] \\) is computed and used to evolve the function u(x) under the operator L, without further intervention, will the resulting function \\( v(t) \\) remain unchanged at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution under the operator L, which corresponds to a second derivative, fundamentally alters the frequency spectrum of u(x). The Fourier transform changes how u(x) manifests in the frequency domain, and operating on this transformed function with L will likely lead to changes in the function's structure by t = T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The Fourier transform of the function u(x), denoted F[u(x)], evolves under the operator L to become F[-u''(x)], which is equivalent to (2πiξ)^2 U(ξ), where U(ξ) is the Fourier transform of u(x). This transformed function U(ξ) remains unchanged over time t = T without further intervention."
