  "Problem": "Analyzing a system where the output z is defined by the Fourier transform of x, denoted as \\\\( z(t) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{x(t)\\\\} \\\\), and x is modulated by a function \\\\( h(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where a is a constant.\n\nIf a different modulation \\\\( k(t) = e^{bt} \\\\) is applied as an intervention after initial modulation and before the Fourier transform, will the outcome in the Fourier domain depend distinctly on both modulations?",
  "Explanation": "Applying an additional modulation \\\\( k(t) \\\\) will further shift the frequency content from \\\\( z(\\\\omega - ia) \\\\) to \\\\( z(\\\\omega - i(a + b)) \\\\). Hence, the outcome distinctly reflects the composite effect of both modulations, revealing the dependency on each.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The modulation functions h(t) and k(t) both affect x(t), which in turn determines z(t) through its Fourier transform."
