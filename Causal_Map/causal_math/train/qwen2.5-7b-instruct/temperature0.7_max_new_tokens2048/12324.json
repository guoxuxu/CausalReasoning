  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We explore the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( h(x) = U^{-1}x \\\\), where U is a matrix that diagonalizes D (i.e., \\\\( UDU^{-1} = D' \\\\) is a diagonal matrix).\n\nIf \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to evolving \\\\( x_0 \\\\) directly under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(x) = U^{-1}x \\\\) alters the initial condition \\\\( x_0 \\\\) to \\\\( U^{-1}x_0 \\\\), changing the trajectory of the evolution under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\). The evolution will occur in the transformed coordinates, potentially giving a different final state when transformed back to the original coordinates.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
