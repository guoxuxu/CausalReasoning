  "Problem": "In a control system, the state vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\) evolves according to the linear system \\\\( \\\\dot{x}(t) = Dx(t) + u(t) \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a control input. A transformation is applied defined by \\\\( h(x) = e^{Ft}x(t) \\\\), where \\\\( F \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) (i.e., the use of \\\\( e^{Ft} \\\\)), it cannot be definitively concluded whether the observed state vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\) resulted from the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) or a transformed initial state \\\\( e^{Ft}x(0) \\\\). The transformation could obscure the initial condition.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The control input u(t) and the system matrix D directly cause the evolution of the state vector x(t). The initial state x(0) also influences x(t). Applying the transformation h(x) does not provide information about the original vector x_0 at t=0 without additional data."
