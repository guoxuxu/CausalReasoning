  "Problem": "Consider the eigenvalue problem in the context of an operator \\( L \\) defined on a complex function space whereby \\( Lf = \\lambda f \\). We analyze the effects of altering this relation by an integral transform \\( T \\) defined by \\( (Tf)(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty k(x,t)f(t) dt \\), where \\( k(x, t) \\) is a given kernel function.\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), a modification by another integral transform \\( U \\), defined similarly to \\( T \\), is applied to \\( Tf \\), where \\( f \\) is an eigenfunction of \\( L \\), will the resulting function \\( U(Tf) \\) definitely not be an eigenfunction of \\( L \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given that neither \\( T \\) nor \\( U \\) commutes with \\( L \\) and considering they are distinct transformations potentially with different kernels, the subsequent application of \\( U \\) on \\( Tf \\) further complicates the relationship, making it highly unlikely for \\( U(Tf) \\) to remain as an eigenfunction of \\( L \\). Each transformation could disrupt the eigenstructure maintained by \\( L \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the integral transform U to Tf does not necessarily result in an eigenfunction of L with the same eigenvalue."
