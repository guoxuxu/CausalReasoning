  "Problem": "Consider a curved surface in the 3D space described by the equation \\( z = f(x,y) \\). We explore the effect of multiple complex transformations on this surface. Specifically, we look at transformations represented by \\( g(z) = e^{Cz} \\) where C is a constant complex matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\( g(z) \\) is applied to the surface \\( z = f(x,y) \\) and the system is then left to evolve under natural geometric constraints without further intervention, will the resultant surface at time \\( T \\) be identical to the original surface \\( z = f(x,y) \\) evolved naturally?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( g(z) = e^{Cz} \\) fundamentally alters the initial geometry of the surface, affecting how it interacts with its environment and evolves over time. Specifically, the transformation introduces a complex exponential scaling that will change curvature and surface properties, leading to a different configuration at time \\( T \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
