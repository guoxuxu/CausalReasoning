  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u) \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a differential operator. We evaluate the impact of an initial condition transformation described by \\\\( g(u) = \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}(e^{kt}\\\\mathcal{F}(u)) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is the Fourier transform and k is a constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( h(u) = \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}(e^{mt}\\\\mathcal{F}(u)) \\\\) (where m is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( u(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on L and not on k or m?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(u) \\\\) introduces another modifying factor, altering the frequency components of the function. The final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) depends on the initial frequency modifications by \\\\( g(u) \\\\), the effect of \\\\( L \\\\), and the intervention by \\\\( h(u) \\\\). Each contributes through their influence on different components.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
