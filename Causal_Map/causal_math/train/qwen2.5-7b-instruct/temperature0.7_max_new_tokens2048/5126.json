  "Problem": "Consider an electrical network involving a complex impedance function \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{s + a}{s^2 + bs + c} \\\\), where s is the complex frequency, and a, b, c are constants. An impulse response h(t) of this network is obtained through the inverse Laplace transform of Z(s).\n\nCan we determine the precise value of 'a' after measuring the impulse response h(t) at time T without knowing the original function Z(s)?",
  "Explanation": "Without the complete knowledge of the function Z(s), specifically constants b and c, the specific contributions of these parameters to the observed h(t) cannot be isolated, making it impossible to unambiguously determine 'a' from h(t) alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
