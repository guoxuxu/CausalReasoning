  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real scalar frequency. Analyze the behavior under the influence of a Laplace transformation defined by \\\\( L[z](s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nIf an intervention changes the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to a new frequency \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final Laplace transform still be representable as \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The frequency change intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces a new function from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) onwards. The final Laplace transform will be affected by both segments of the function pre- and post-intervention, leading to a form that cannot purely be represented by \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The frequency ω influences z(t) through the differential equation, and changing ω to ω' at time t1 alters z(t). The complex number s determines the form of the Laplace transform L[z](s), which can be represented as 1/(s - iω) given the original differential equation."
