  "Problem": "Consider a system where a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) undergoes a transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{At}z\\\\), where A is a constant complex number. The function influences the trajectory over time t.\n\nIf \\\\(f(z)\\\\) is initially applied to a complex number \\\\(z_0\\\\) and the system then evolves according to \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Bz\\\\), where B is another constant complex number, will \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at time T be equivalent to simply evolving \\\\(z_0\\\\) under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Bz\\\\) for the same duration?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\(f(z)\\\\) initially modifies \\\\(z_0\\\\) into \\\\(e^{At}z_0\\\\), changing the starting point of the evolution under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Bz\\\\). This difference in initial conditions generally leads to a different trajectory and endpoint, dependent on both A and B.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation f(z) with constant A to z_0 results in z(T), which then evolves under the dynamics described by B to also result in z(T) after time T."
