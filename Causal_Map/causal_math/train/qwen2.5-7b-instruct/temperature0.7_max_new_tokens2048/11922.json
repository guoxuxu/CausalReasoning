  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the effects of an integral transform \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{St}z(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( S \\\\) is a complex constant matrix.\n\nIf at some intermediate time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( K[z] = z e^{Ut} \\\\) (where \\\\( U \\\\) is a complex matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced by only \\\\( P \\\\) and not \\\\( S \\\\) or \\\\( U \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Such an intervention with \\\\( K[z] \\\\) introduces additional dynamics via \\\\( e^{Ut} \\\\), impacting the trajectory and final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Thus, the endpoint is dependent on the initial transform \\\\( S \\\\), the later modification \\\\( U \\\\), as well as the inherent system dynamics driven by \\\\( P \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
