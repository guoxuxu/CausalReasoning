  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We examine the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\(T(z) = \\\\int_0^t z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau\\\\).\n\nCan the original frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) be determined after observing the result of \\\\(T(z)\\\\) at T, if an unknown intervention changed the function at an unknown time t1 < T?",
  "Explanation": "The modification of the frequency at an unknown time results in an altered integral result, where the original and altered segments of the function contribute differently. Without knowledge of the intervention's nature and timing, the original frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) cannot be uniquely retrieved.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
