  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution over a metal rod T(x,t) is governed by the heat equation \\\\(u_t = k u_{xx}\\\\), where k is the thermal diffusivity. We examine the impact of a temperature altering function \\\\(g(T) = T + e^{-\\lambda t}\\\\) applied at t = 0 and explore how this function affects the temperature evolution over time.\n\nGiven the temperature profile \\\\(T(x,T)\\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\(g(T)\\\\), \\\\(h(T)\\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\(T(x,T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The end temperature profile \\\\(T(x,T)\\\\) can be influenced by multiple potential sequences or types of interventions, due to the nature of the exponentially decaying functions and their spatial dependencies. The superposition of heat effects and the decay functions complicate the attribute traces sufficiently that exact interventions cannot be uniquely identified.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
