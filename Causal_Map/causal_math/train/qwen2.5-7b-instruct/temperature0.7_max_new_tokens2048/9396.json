  "Problem": "Considering a signal processing scenario where a continuous-time signal \\( x(t) \\) undergoes a Fourier transform to produce \\( X(f) \\), and then a filter characterized by a function \\( H(f) \\) is applied to \\( X(f) \\).\n\nGiven the output \\( y(t) \\), can we definitively ascertain whether the signal underwent a transformation by \\( G(f) \\) or \\( H(f) \\) or both, based solely on the observation of \\( y(t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\( y(t) \\), multiple combinations of \\( G(f) \\) and \\( H(f) \\) might yield the same \\( y(t) \\) due to the convolution-like behavior in frequency domain. Disentangling these without additional information about either the input \\( X(f) \\) or the functional forms of the filters is typically infeasible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
