  "Problem": "Consider a continuous complex function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) governed by a differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{df}{dz} = izf(z) \\\\). We analyze the transformation of this function using a Fourier transform defined by \\\\( F(f)(s) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(z) e^{-isz} dz \\\\).\n\nKnowing the Fourier transform \\\\( F(f)(s) \\\\) at time \\\\( t \\\\), can we infer the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at an earlier time, without knowing the exact form of \\\\( f \\\\) or whether any operations were applied?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution according to \\\\( \\\\frac{df}{dz} = izf(z) \\\\) introduces exponential growth factors that cannot be explicitly unwound solely with knowledge of the Fourier transform, as the transform mixes frequencies and amplitude changes over time in a non-reversible manner.",
