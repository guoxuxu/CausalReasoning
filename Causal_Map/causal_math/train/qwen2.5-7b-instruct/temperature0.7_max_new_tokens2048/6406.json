  "Problem": "Consider a system of complex functions where the transformation \\\\( T(z) = e^{i \\\\omega t} z \\\\) is applied over time t, with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a constant. The system operates under the function \\\\( z'(t) = e^{\\\\lambda t} z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T > 0, can we infer the original value of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the information regarding the application of \\\\( T(z) \\\\), retrieving the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is ambiguous, as the rotation introduced by \\\\( T(z) \\\\) affects the phase of \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The compounded effect of exponential growth makes it impossible to uniquely determine the initial state.",
