  "Problem": "Assume a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) defined in a complex domain that undergoes a Laplace transformation \\\\( L \\\\) applied to it, resulting in \\\\( F(s) = L\\\\{z(x)\\\\}(s) \\\\). Consider also actions of modifications using multiplier functions \\\\( m(x) = e^{-ax} \\\\) and \\\\( n(s) = s^b \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are constants.\n\nIf \\\\( m(x) \\\\) is multiplied to \\\\( z(x) \\\\) before applying Laplace transform at the initial time, will \\\\( F(s) \\\\) be affected solely by the parameter \\\\( a \\\\) in the transformation function, maintaining the essential form of the original transform?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying by \\\\( m(x) \\\\) which is \\\\( e^{-ax} \\\\) before the Laplace transform effectively shifts the transform in the s-domain by a constant \\\\( a \\\\), according to the shifting property of the Laplace Transform, thereby affecting \\\\( F(s) \\\\) by essentially shifting its poles without altering its fundamental form.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "a influences m(x), which when multiplied by z(x) before Laplace transformation, affects F(s); b influences n(s), and L{z(x)}(s) transforms to F(s); inverse Laplace transform of F(s) with n(s) recovers x-domain function."
