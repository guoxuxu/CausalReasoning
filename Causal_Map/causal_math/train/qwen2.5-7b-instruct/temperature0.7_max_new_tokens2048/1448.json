  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time describing a physical system. We utilize a Fourier Transform to analyze frequency components, defined as \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier Transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can the presence of external interventions introducing new frequency components be inferred?",
  "Explanation": "If new or unexpected frequency components are present in the Fourier Transform that are not accounted for by the known natural behavior of the system, it suggests the presence of external interventions or modifications to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
