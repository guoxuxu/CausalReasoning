  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 \\phi = 0 \\\\) in two dimensions, where \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) is a scalar potential. The complex function transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{wz} \\\\) is applied to the complex variable \\\\( z = x + iy \\\\), with \\\\( w \\\\) being a complex constant.\n\nKnowing the potential function \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) at a later time, can one determine exactly the sequence and types of boundary transformations (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) applied?",
  "Explanation": "Several different sequences or types of transformations could yield the same potential function \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) due to the complex nature of the influences and the non-uniqueness of boundary condition imposition in such linear partial differential equations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
