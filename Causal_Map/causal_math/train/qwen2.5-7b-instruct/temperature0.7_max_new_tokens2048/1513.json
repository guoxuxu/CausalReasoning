  "Problem": "Consider a harmonic oscillator modeled by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + \\\\omega^2 x = 0\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the natural frequency of the system. We explore the effects of a linear transformation \\\\(T(x) = Ax + B\\\\), where A and B are matrices, on the system's state.\n\nIf \\\\(T(x)\\\\) is applied to an initial state \\\\(x_0\\\\) and then the system is allowed to evolve according to the oscillator's dynamics without further intervention, will the state \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at time t be equivalent to evolution directly from \\\\(x_0\\\\) under the harmonic oscillator's dynamics?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\(T(x)\\\\) modifies the initial condition, altering the state's trajectory. Since the transformation includes a translation by B and a linear transformation by A, the resulting motion trajectory of the oscillator will differ from that which would have been obtained by simply evolving \\\\(x_0\\\\) under the oscillator’s dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the linear transformation T(x) to the initial state x_0 before evolving according to the harmonic oscillator's dynamics results in a state x(t) that is not equivalent to evolving x_0 directly under the oscillator's dynamics."
