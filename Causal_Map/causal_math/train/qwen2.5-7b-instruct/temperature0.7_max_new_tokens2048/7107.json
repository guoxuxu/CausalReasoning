  "Problem": "Examine the effects of a complex function transformation \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\) on the complex plane, where \\\\(t\\\\) is time. This scenario includes the subsequent application of Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) on a complex function \\\\(f(z)\\\\).\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\(z'(t) = e^{-t}\\\\) is applied at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\) as an intervention, will the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(z'(t))\\\\}\\\\) solely reflect the properties of the new transformation ignoring the earlier \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The secondary transformation, \\\\(z'(t) = e^{-t}\\\\), shifts the function further, potentially affecting both convergence and the range of \\\\(f\\\\). The final behavior of the Laplace transform will be a result of both the original and the intervention transformations, combining effects from \\\\(e^{it}\\\\) and \\\\(e^{-t}\\\\).",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Time t influences the complex function z(t), which in turn affects f(z). At time t_1, the intervention z'(t_1) influences f(z'), which then determines L{f(z')}. The Laplace transform L{f(z')}, therefore, reflects only the properties of the new transformation z'(t) starting from t_1, independent of the earlier transformation z(t)."
