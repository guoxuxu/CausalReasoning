  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The transformation by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{at}z \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant, is studied.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{bt}z \\\\) (where \\\\( b \\\\) is another complex constant) is applied at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for t > t_1 only depend on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( a \\\\) or \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional intervention changes the state at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), and thus the subsequent evolution is dependent on the previous transformation factor and the new one introduced by \\\\( g(z) \\\\). The final state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is influenced by the combined effects of \\\\( a \\\\), \\\\( b \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), through the multiplicative combination of scaling and rotating the initial complex number.",
