  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform in signal processing, \\(F(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\}\\) where \\(f(t)\\) is a time-domain representation and \\(F(s)\\) is its frequency-domain representation. The effect of an impulse response function \\(h(t)\\) on \\(f(t)\\), transformed as \\(H(s)\\), is analyzed through its impact on \\(F(s)\\).\n\nGiven the frequency domain representation \\( G(s) = H(s)F(s) \\), can we uniquely determine \\( f(t) \\) without knowledge of \\( h(t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing \\( h(t) \\) and hence \\( H(s) \\), it is impossible to uniquely recover \\( f(t) \\) from \\( G(s) \\). \\( G(s) \\) could arise from many different potential functions \\( f(t) \\) depending on the properties of \\( H(s) \\).",

List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
