  "Problem": "Analyze the impact of a contour integral transformation on a complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) by proposing the transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_C e^{zt} dz \\\\), where C is a closed contour around the origin and t is a real-parameter.\n\nFrom the output of the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\), can we determine the specific form of the original function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) accurately without external information?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional details like the contour C or the parameter t, recovering the exact functional form of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) from the result of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is generally indeterminate due to potential variations in the parameters (e.g., the shape and location of C).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
