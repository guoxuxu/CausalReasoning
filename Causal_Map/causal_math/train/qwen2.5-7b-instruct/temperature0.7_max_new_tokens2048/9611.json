  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{Dt}x \\\\), where C and D are constant matrices, and x is an initial condition vector. We examine the influence of the Laplace transform \\\\( L\\{z(t)\\} = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\, dt \\\\), where s is a complex number, during different interventions over time t.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention altering D to a new constant matrix E is applied, will the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) onward be independent of the initial matrix D?",
  "Explanation": "Intervening and changing D to E creates a new system dynamics starting at \\\\( t_1 \\\\). The result of the Laplace transform for times greater than \\\\( t_1 \\\\) will reflect the change, indicating dependency on both the initial condition influenced by D and the subsequent dynamics governed by E.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "D directly influences z(t) and its Laplace transform L{z(t)}. After time t1, changing D to E directly influences z(t) and its Laplace transform L{z(t)} for t ≥ t1, making L{z(t)} from t1 onward dependent on E rather than the initial D."
