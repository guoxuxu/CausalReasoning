  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\kappa \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the impact of a transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it is unclear if the initial conditions were altered by the transformation \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t}z_0 \\\\). This ambiguity prevents the unique determination of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) because the scaling by \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) could complicate the reverse calculation.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z at time t (z(t)) is determined by the initial condition z_0, the constant ω, the constant κ, and the constant α. Applying the function f(z) = e^(αt)z transforms z(t) from its initial form z_0."
