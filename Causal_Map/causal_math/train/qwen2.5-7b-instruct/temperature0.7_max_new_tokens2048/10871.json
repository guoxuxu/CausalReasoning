  "Problem": "Consider a vibrating mechanical system that can be mathematically modeled as a differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + 2\\\\zeta\\\\omega\\\\frac{dx}{dt} + \\\\omega^2x = 0\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\zeta\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) are damping ratio and natural frequency respectively. Suppose an external impulse given by the function \\\\(f(t) = \\\\delta(t - t_0)\\\\) (Dirac delta function) applies at time \\\\(t_0\\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\(t_1 > t_0\\\\), another external force \\\\(g(t) = H(t-t_1)\\\\) (a Heaviside step function) is applied as an intervention, will the resulting system's behavior at time \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) show a combined influence of both \\\\(f(t)\\\\) and \\\\(g(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The second intervention with \\\\(g(t)\\\\) adds a continuous force starting at \\\\(t_1\\\\), affecting the system’s amplitude progressively from that point onwards. This, combined with the initial impulse, means that the system's behavior at time \\\\(T\\\\) is the result of both influences, reflecting changes in amplitude and potential phase shifts.",
