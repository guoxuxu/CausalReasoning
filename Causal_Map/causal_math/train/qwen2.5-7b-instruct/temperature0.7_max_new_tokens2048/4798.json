  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(t) = e^{j\\omega t} x(t) \\) where \\( x(t) \\) is a time-dependent input signal and \\( \\omega \\) is a constant frequency. The dynamics of \\( x(t) \\) in the system are described by a complex function \\( x(t+1) = L x(t) \\), where \\( L \\) is a linear transformation.\n\nCan we deduce the initial signal \\( x_0 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) after observing \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) without knowing whether the transformation \\( z(t) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the initial phase modulation \\( e^{j\\omega t} \\), we cannot accurately trace back to the original signal \\( x_0 \\) from \\( z(T) \\). The modulation may have altered significant characteristics of the signal, such as phase, which are critical to reconstructing \\( x_0 \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial signal x(0) influences x(t) which then determines z(t); the linear transformation L affects x(t+1) from x(t); time t+1 advances x(t) to x(t+1); observing z(T) at time T provides information about x(T); if T is known, z(T) can help deduce x(0) given the dynamics."
