  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where an input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) undergoes a transformation using a Fourier Transform, denoted as \\\\( F(x)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} x(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\). This transformed signal is then filtered through a system characterized by a transfer function \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\), impacting the output signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the output signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\) after it has been processed, can we precisely determine the original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without knowing the nature of \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) or the fact that a Fourier Transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge about the transformation and the transfer function, reconstructing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is generally impossible as many different inputs can result in the same output due to the loss of original signal features and phase information caused by both the transformation and filtering.",
