  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), a basic wave equation where \\\\(c\\\\) is the velocity of wave propagation. We investigate how the application of the Laplace transform \\\\(L\\\\) affects the solution \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\), specifically when considering boundary conditions and time transformations.\n\nIf at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) an external force \\\\(f(x,t) = e^{\\\\alpha t}\\\\) is applied as an intervention, will this transformation's effect visible in the Laplace domain depend only on the parameter \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) and not on the wave velocity \\\\(c\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the external force's transformation is primarily dependent on \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\), its effect in the Laplace domain also depends on how it interacts with the underlying wave equation's characteristics, such as the wave velocity \\\\(c\\\\). The coupling between \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) and \\\\(c\\\\) influences the transformed solution, making both parameters influential.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Laplace transform to the external force f(x,t) results in a transformed function L(f(x,t)) that depends on α but not c. The Laplace transform of the wave solution u(x,t) is u(x,s), which is influenced by c."
