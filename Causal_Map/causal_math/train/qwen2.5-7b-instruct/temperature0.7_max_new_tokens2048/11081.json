  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) passed through an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) described by the kernel \\\\( K(t, s) = e^{-(t-s)^2} \\\\), such that the transformed function is \\\\( Tz(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} K(t, s) z(t) \\, dt \\).\n\nDoes the function transformation \\\\( T \\\\) applied on the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any intervention preserve the frequency component \\\\( \\omega \\\\) of the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The kernel \\\\( K(t, s) = e^{-(t-s)^2} \\\\), being a Gaussian, acts as a smoothing operator and potentially alters the frequency components of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The transformation generally disperses energy across a spectrum of frequencies, which means that the exact frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) may not be preserved identically.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The frequency component ω of the original function z(t) is preserved in the transformed function Tz(s) because the transformation T does not alter the frequency content."
