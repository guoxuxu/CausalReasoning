  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output \\\\( z \\\\) is given by the Fourier transform of a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), applied to an input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\). Assume that the Fourier transform pair is represented by \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) for \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) for \\\\( h(t) \\\\), and the resulting output in the frequency domain is \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) = H(\\\\omega) X(\\\\omega) \\\\).\n\nKnowing the output \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\), can we determine precisely if an intervention by multiplying \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) was applied to the input signal, just by analyzing \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) itself, without additional information about the transformation \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) or the nature of alterations applied on \\\\( x(t) \\\\), doesn't provide sufficient information to uniquely determine whether the specific intervention \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) was used. Various combinations of \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) and alterations could result in the same output spectrum.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input signal x(t) transforms to X(ω) via the Fourier transform, the impulse response h(t) transforms to H(ω), and their product in the frequency domain Z(ω) = H(ω) * X(ω) determines the output z. Knowing Z(ω) does not directly reveal if an intervention like multiplying by e^(At) was applied to x(t)."
