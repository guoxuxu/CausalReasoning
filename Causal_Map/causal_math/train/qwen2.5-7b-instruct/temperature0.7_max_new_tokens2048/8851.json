  "Problem": "Let's consider a control system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx + Nu\\\\), where M and N are constant matrices, and u represents a control input. We'll explore how different integral transforms, specifically the Laplace Transform, affect our response to changes in control strategy depicted by \\\\( u(t) = V(t)x + W(t) \\\\), where V(t) and W(t) are time-varying matrices.\n\nAssuming that at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new control strategy \\\\( u(t) = Q(t)x + R(t) \\\\) (where Q and R are different time-varying matrices) is implemented, is the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 solely dependent on the matrices M and N?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a secondary control strategy modifies the system's dynamics further beyond the influence of just M and N, incorporating the effects of the matrices Q(t) and R(t). Each control action alters how the system responses, making the final state a result of the complex interaction of these matrices.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The control input u(t) is influenced by V(t) and W(t), while Q(t) and R(t) represent a new control strategy that replaces V(t) and W(t) after time t1. M and N directly determine the state x(t). The final state x(T) for T > t1 depends on M, N, and the control strategy represented by Q(t) and R(t)."
