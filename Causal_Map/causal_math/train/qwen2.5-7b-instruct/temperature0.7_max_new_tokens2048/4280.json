  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit with a resistor R and an inductor L in series, governed by the differential equation \\\\(L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t)\\\\), where \\\\(V(t)\\\\) denotes the applied voltage. We introduce a transformation \\\\(g(I) = I + ct\\\\), where c is a constant, applied to the current I at time t.\n\nGiven the final current \\\\(I(T)\\\\), can we precisely determine the initial transformation and additional voltage interventions applied, solely based on knowing \\\\(I(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final measurement of \\\\(I(T)\\\\) could result from various combinations of initial transformations and/or different scaling and timing of the voltage interventions. Due to the dependencies on multiple factors and potential overlaps in effects, it is impossible to uniquely ascertain the exact interventions or transformations applied from the final current alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
