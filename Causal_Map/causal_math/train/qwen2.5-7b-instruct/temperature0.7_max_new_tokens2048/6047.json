  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The evolution of this function is studied under a transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\), applied at different intervals of time t.\n\nSuppose a new transformation \\\\( j(z) = z^3 \\\\) is introduced at t = T_1 as an intervention. Does the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > T_1 depend only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on the earlier applied transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The intervening transformation changes the power to which the exponential is raised, impacting the trajectory profoundly. The final form of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on the sequence of transformations (\\\\( h(z) \\\\), then \\\\( j(z) \\\\)), including their compound effects: \\\\( z(T) \\\\) becomes either \\\\( e^{3i\\\\omega (T-T_1)} \\\\) multiplied by either \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega T_1} \\\\) or \\\\( e^{2i\\\\omega T_1} \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z(T) depends on ω through the initial function z(t) = e^(iωt), and is also influenced by the transformations h(z) = z^2 and j(z) = z^3 applied at different times. Specifically, after T = T_1, z(T) is further transformed by j(z) = z^3."
