  "Problem": "Analyze the impact of the complex transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{it}w \\\\) on a function \\\\( w \\\\) in the complex plane over time t. The function evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}w = iAw \\\\), where A is a constant complex matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) = e^{it}w \\\\) is applied to a complex vector \\\\( w_0 \\\\) initially, and then allowed to evolve by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}w = iAw \\\\) for time T without further changes, will the resulting \\\\( w(T) \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( w_0 \\\\) was evolved by \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}w = iAw \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{it}w \\\\) changes the initial condition from \\\\( w_0 \\\\) to \\\\( e^{iT}w_0 \\\\). Since the transformation modifies the magnitude and phase of the system state vector initially, it will typically lead to a different state at time T when evolving under \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}w = iAw \\\\), unless A is specifically tailored or zero.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation z(t) directly influences w through the initial condition w_0, while the constant matrix A and time t also directly influence w. The duration T influences the final state of w through the evolution described by the differential equation."
