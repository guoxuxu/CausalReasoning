  "Problem": "Analyze the impact on the solution of an integral equation \\\\( x(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(t-s)A} B u(s) \\\\, ds \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices and u(t) is a control function. We investigate the effects of transformations defined by \\\\( h(x) = Cx \\\\), where C is a constant matrix, applied at different times.\n\nIf a transformation \\\\( g(x) = Dx \\\\) where D is a constant matrix is applied at a certain instant t_1 > 0, will the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend exclusively on the actions of the integral equation up to t_1 and not influenced further?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention at t_1 introduces a new transformation \\\\( Dx \\\\) which modifies the state and influences how the solution evolves according to the integral equation from t_1 to T. The final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) now depends on both the historical actions until t_1 and the new transformation applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The control function u(t) and the matrices A and B directly cause the state x(t). Applying the transformation Cx at time t+Δt modifies x(t+Δt). Applying the transformation Dx at time t_1 modifies x(t_1) but does not affect the state x(T) for T > t_1 beyond the change at t_1."
