  "Problem": "Consider a heat distribution on a metal rod described by the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) represents the temperature at point x and time t, and k is the thermal diffusivity. Assess the effect of a heat source represented by a function \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\) added at specific points over time.\n\nKnowing just the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) at time T, can we precisely determine whether a cooling intervention was applied, independent of the heat source function \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) could be the result of various combinations of initial heat distribution, applied heat sources, and cooling interventions. The effects of cooling could either amplify or mask the effects of the heat source, making it impossible to uniquely decipher the interventions or their specific characteristics based on the final observed state alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The temperature distribution at time T (u(x,T)) is influenced by the initial temperature distribution and the heat source over time (h(x,t)), which in turn affects the temperature distribution at any given time (u(x,t))."
