  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(w) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} w(t) dt \\\\), a Laplace transform operating on a function w(t). We explore changes induced by modifying w(t) either through a polynomial scaling \\\\( p(t) = t^n \\\\) or an exponential modifier \\\\( q(t) = e^{ct} \\\\), where c is a constant and n is a positive integer.\n\nIf an intervention modifies w(t) at a time t1 with q(t) to become w''(t) = e^{ct} w(t), and then we take its Laplace transform, will z(w'')(s) be dependent solely on the characteristics of w(t) and not on the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The exponential intervention represented by q(t) effectively alters the entire function w(t) with an exponential growth factor e^{ct}, significantly impacting how the function interacts with e^{-st} in the transform. Thus, z(w'')(s) will be dependent on both the original w(t) characteristics and the parameters of the exponential intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the exponential modifier q(t) to w(t) at time t1 to produce w''(t) results in a new function whose Laplace transform z(w''(s)) depends on the transformed characteristics of w(t) rather than the specific intervention."
