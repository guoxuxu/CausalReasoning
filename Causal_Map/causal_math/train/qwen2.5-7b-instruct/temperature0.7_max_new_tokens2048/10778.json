  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) where A is a constant matrix. We analyze the effects of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{At}z \\\\, dt \\\\), where T is a specific time point greater than zero.\n\nHaving observed the output from \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at time T, can we uniquely determine the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) if we do not know whether the integral transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied, the accumulated effect of the integral transformation on \\\\( z_0 \\\\) before application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) creates ambiguity. If \\\\( g(z) \\\\) alters the state significantly before the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), tracing back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) uniquely is not feasible.",
