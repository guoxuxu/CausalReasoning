  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{z} e^{s^2} ds \\\\) over the complex plane. We examine the implications of a linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = az + b \\\\) where a and b are complex constants, on points in the complex plane.\n\nIf a different transformation \\\\( U(z) = cz + d \\\\) (where c and d are also complex constants) is applied after computing \\\\( g(T(z_0)) \\\\), will the ultimate outcome \\\\( g(U(T(z_0))) \\\\) be independent of the parameters of \\\\( T \\\\) and rely solely on \\\\( g(z_0) \\\\) and \\\\( U \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "After the application of \\\\( T \\\\) and then \\\\( U \\\\), the end result \\\\( g(U(T(z_0))) \\\\) is influenced by the specifics of both transformations because each one changes the path and region of integration in the complex plane. Therefore, the impact of \\\\( T \\\\) is not negated merely by applying \\\\( U \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
