  "Problem": "Analyze a Fourier Transform scenario where a function \\\\( f(x) = e^{-x^2} \\\\) is transformed into its Fourier counterpart \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) and affected by a convolution with a Gaussian kernel \\\\( g(x) = e^{-a x^2} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is transformed to \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) and then convoluted with the Fourier transform of \\\\( g(x) \\\\) without further intervention, will the inverse Fourier transform of the convolution produce the same function as the initial \\\\( f(x) \\\\) convoluted with \\\\( g(x) \\\\) in the spatial domain?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution theorem states that the Fourier transform of the convolution of two functions is the product of their Fourier transforms. Consequently, convolving \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and \\\\( g(x) \\\\) directly or transforming, multiplying, and reversing the transform will yield the same result due to the properties of the Fourier transform and convolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function f(x) transforms to F(ω), which then convolves to F_g(ω), transforming back to f_g(x) through inverse Fourier transform; this process is equivalent to directly convolving f(x) with g(x) in the spatial domain."
