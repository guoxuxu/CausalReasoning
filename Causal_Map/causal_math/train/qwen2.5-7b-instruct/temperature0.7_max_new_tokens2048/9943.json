  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving in a potential field described by the equation \\\\( U(x) = \\\\frac{1}{2} k x^2 \\\\) where k is a positive constant. The particle's motion is transformed by a change of coordinates given by \\\\( x(t) = e^{\\\\alpha t} x_0 \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( y(t) = e^{\\\\beta t}x(t) \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the final position \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 only depend on k and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( y(t) = e^{\\\\beta t}x(t) \\\\) introduces another scaling factor that modifies the trajectory of the particle further. The final position at time T depends on the initial scale factor \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), the new scale factor \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), and the constant k, due to the cumulative effect of the transformations on the potential.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The final position x(T) depends on k, α, and β through the transformations x(t) and y(t). Specifically, x(t) is influenced by k, α, and t, while y(t) is influenced by β and x(t). Therefore, x(T) indirectly depends on k, α, and β."
