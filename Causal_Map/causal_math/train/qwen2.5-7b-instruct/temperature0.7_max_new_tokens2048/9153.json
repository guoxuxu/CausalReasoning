  "Problem": "In a control system, the effect of a matrix operator \\\\( P \\\\) on a signal's Fourier transform is examined. Given a signal function \\\\( x(t) \\\\), its Fourier transform at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is denoted by \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\). The operator \\\\( P \\\\) acts on \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) to produce \\\\( P(X(\\\\omega)) = \\\\frac{1}{s + \\\\omega^2}X(\\\\omega) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( P \\\\) is applied to \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) and the transformed signal is then processed through a system characterized by \\\\( G(s) = s + \\\\omega^2 \\\\) without further intervention, will the output at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) was processed directly through \\\\( G(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( P \\\\) first and then \\\\( G(s) \\\\) effectively cancels out the transformation introduced by \\\\( P \\\\) since \\\\( G(s)P(X(\\\\omega)) = (s + \\\\omega^2)\\\\frac{1}{s + \\\\omega^2}X(\\\\omega) = X(\\\\omega) \\\\). Hence, the output is the same as if the signal had been processed through \\\\( G(s) \\\\) directly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the matrix operator P to X(ω) results in P(X(ω)) = (s + ω^2)^(-1)X(ω), which, when processed through G(s) = s + ω^2, yields X(ω). Directly processing X(ω) through G(s) gives (s + ω^2)X(ω). Therefore, the output at frequency ω differs between the two processes."
