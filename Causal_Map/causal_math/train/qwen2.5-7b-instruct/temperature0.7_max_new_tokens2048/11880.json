  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the state vector \\\\( x \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx + Nu \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant matrix representing the system dynamics and \\\\( N \\\\) is a control input matrix. A transformation \\\\( h(x) = e^{Dx} \\\\) (where \\\\( D \\\\) is also a constant matrix) is studied for its effects on the system.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied to the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and then the state is allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx + Nu \\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at time t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx + Nu \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(x) = e^{Dx} \\\\) modifies the initial condition in a non-linear way, varying the system's trajectory from its original path. The change in initial conditions due to the transformation will lead to a different state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state x_0 directly influences the state x(t) through the system dynamics Mx_0 + Nu. The transformation h(x_0) = e^(Dx_0) does not directly influence x(t) under the given dynamics, but instead transforms the initial state before it enters the system."
