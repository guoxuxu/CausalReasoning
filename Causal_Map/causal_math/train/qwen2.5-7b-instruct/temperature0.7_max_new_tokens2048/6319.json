  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz \\\\), where i is the imaginary unit. Assume an external transformation is defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{wt}z \\\\), where w is a complex constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{ut}z \\\\) (where u is another complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of w and only dependent on i and u?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces another layer of complexity, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on i, w, and u. The transformations \\\\( e^{wt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{ut} \\\\) interact with the dynamical system, affecting the system's trajectory and hence the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of z with respect to time is directly influenced by i, and the endpoint z(T) after applying the intervention g(z) is directly influenced by u."
