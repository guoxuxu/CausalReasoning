  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, representing a periodic signal in the complex plane. Analyze the effect of a Laplace Transform on this function, assuming the transform is defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z(t)) = Z(s) \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nIf at a certain point in the frequency domain analysis a filter \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the resultant transformed function still accurately reflect the original characteristics of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of a filter \\\\( F(s) \\\\) in the frequency domain modifies the characteristics of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), typically by altering its amplitude and/or phase. This changes the resulting function from what would have been obtained if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was transformed without intervention, thus not accurately reflecting the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The original function z(t) transforms to Z(s) via the Laplace Transform. Applying a filter F(s) changes the transformed function to Z'(s), which may alter the characteristics of the original function z(t)."
