  "Problem": "Consider a sequence of complex transformations applied to a function \\\\(h(z)\\\\) in the complex plane, described by \\\\(h_1(z) = e^{Az}h(z)\\\\) initially and then \\\\(h_2(z) = e^{Bz}h_1(z)\\\\) after some time T, where A and B are complex constants.\n\nIf the transformations \\\\(h_1(z)\\\\) and \\\\(h_2(z)\\\\) are applied sequentially to a function \\\\(h(z)\\\\) as described, will the final function \\\\(h_2(T)\\\\) at time T be equal to directly applying a single transformation \\\\(e^{(A+B)T}h(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The sequential application of the transformations leads to compositional action which is analogous to exponential addition in the exponents due to the properties of exponential functions in the complex plane, ultimately equating to a single exponential transformation of the sum of constants A and B over time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function h(z) is transformed into h_1(z) through multiplication by e^(Az), and h_1(z) is further transformed into h_2(z) through multiplication by e^(Bz). Therefore, applying the transformations sequentially results in h_2(z) = e^(Bz)e^(Az)h(z) = e^((A+B)z)h(z)."
