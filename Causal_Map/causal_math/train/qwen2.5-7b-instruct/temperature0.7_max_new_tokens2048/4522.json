  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We study the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) = \\\\hat{u} \\\\) to the function u, and then evolving it under a transformed operator \\\\( \\\\hat{L} \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( F(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the original frequency-domain operations (whether \\\\( F(u) \\\\) was applied), determining \\\\( u_0 \\\\) only from \\\\( u(T) \\\\) is fundamentally ambiguous. The transformation can modify the frequency components of u, making recovery of u_0 uncertain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Fourier transform F(u) to the original function u results in u_hat, and observing the function u at time t = T (u_T) allows us to infer the original function u_0 at t = 0."
