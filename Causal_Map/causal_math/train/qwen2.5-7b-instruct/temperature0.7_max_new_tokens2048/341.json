  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We explore the effect of an integral transform \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty k(s) u(s, t) ds \\\\), where \\\\( k(s) \\\\) is a kernel function.\n\nIf \\\\( T(u) \\\\) is applied to function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) at time t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\) without further intervention, will the transformed system \\\\( T(u) \\\\) at time T correspond to directly applying \\\\( T \\\\) on the function \\\\( u \\\\) evolved to t = T under \\\\( Lu \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( T(u) \\\\) at the initial state modifies the domain of the function by integrating it with kernel \\\\( k(s) \\\\). The evolution of \\\\( u \\\\) under L and subsequent integration can yield different results compared to integrating first and then evolving, due to potential non-linearities or non-commutable properties of L and T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the integral transform T to the initial condition u(x, 0) results in T(u(x, 0)), which evolves under the PDE to become T(u) at time t=T. This evolution is independent of directly applying T to the solution u evolved under the operator L."
