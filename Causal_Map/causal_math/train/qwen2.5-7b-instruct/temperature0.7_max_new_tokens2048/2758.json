  "Problem": "Evaluate the behavior of a complex function z(t) defined as z(t) = e^{At}w, where A is a complex constant matrix, and w is a complex vector. The function represents the evolution of z over time under the influence of matrix A, and we are interested in how various transformations, represented by another complex matrix B, affect this evolution.\n\nAssuming z(T) = e^{AT}w is observed at time T, and you know that a transformation was applied at t = 0, can you uniquely determine if it was f(z) = Bz?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing z(T) = e^{AT}w alone does not provide enough information to conclude definitively that the initial transformation was f(z) = Bz, since multiple potential transformations could lead to the same observed state under the influence of e^{At}. The specific details of B or potential other transformations need to be known to trace back to the exact initial condition.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
