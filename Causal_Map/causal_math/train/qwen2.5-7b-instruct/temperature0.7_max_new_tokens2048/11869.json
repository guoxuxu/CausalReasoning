  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution across a rod is modeled by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) denotes the temperature, and \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. We explore the impact of an initial heat function \\\\( f(x) = e^{-x^2} \\\\) applied along the rod.\n\nAfter observing the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at time T, can we infer the exact form of \\\\( f(x) = e^{-x^2} \\\\) initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "The heat equation causes diffusion of the initial temperature profile, making it increasingly difficult to precisely deduce the original form \\\\( f(x) = e^{-x^2} \\\\) from the later temperature distribution alone, due to the loss of information as the heat spreads.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
