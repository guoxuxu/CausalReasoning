  "Problem": "Consider the impact of different transform kernels in an integral transformation on a function \\\\( f(x) \\\\). Define transform kernels \\\\( K(t, x) = e^{At} \\\\) and intervention kernels \\\\( L(t, x) = e^{Bt} \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices, on the analysis of the function over time.\n\nGiven the function at t = T, can we determine exactly what kernels were applied (whether \\\\( K \\\\), \\\\( L \\\\), or both), solely by analyzing the function at that time?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping influences of the multiple kernels can result in similar transformations of the original function, making it impossible to precisely disentangle and identify from the end state which kernels were applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
