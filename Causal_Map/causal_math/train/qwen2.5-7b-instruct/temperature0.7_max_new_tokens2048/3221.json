  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the displacement \\\\( x \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} = -kx \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a positive constant. We examine the consequence of applying a forcing function \\\\( f(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency, on the system's response over time t.\n\nIf the forcing function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is applied to the system at t = 0, and allowed to influence the system's natural motion under \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} = -kx \\\\) without further intervention, will the system's response \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T merely consist of the natural motion's response?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of \\\\( f(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) fundamentally alters the dynamics of the system by introducing an external driving force. This causes the solution to involve both the homogeneous solution associated with \\\\( -kx \\\\) and a particular solution due to \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), rendering the motion different from the natural motion alone.",

List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
