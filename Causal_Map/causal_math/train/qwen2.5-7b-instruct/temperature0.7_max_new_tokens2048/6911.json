  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system described by \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where A is a real constant, C is a complex constant matrix, and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex vector. We examine the impact of transformation \\\\( h(z) = De^{iBt}z \\\\) over time t, where D is a complex constant matrix and B is another real constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( k(z) = Fe^{iCt}z \\\\) (where F is a constant complex matrix and C is another real constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on C and not on A or B?",
  "Explanation": "Since both the initial transformation by \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and the subsequent intervention by \\\\( k(z) \\\\) affect the system state, the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is influenced by the constants A, B, and C. The transformations cascade and compose, altering the path and final state, resulting in dependence on all parameters.",
