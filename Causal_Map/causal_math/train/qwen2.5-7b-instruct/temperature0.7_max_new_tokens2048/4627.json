  "Problem": "Consider a function defined as \\\\(z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\omega s} x(s) \\, ds\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) represents the input signal and \\\\(e^{i\\omega s}\\\\) is a complex exponential function used for frequency analysis. The transformation aims to filter or modify the frequency components of \\\\(x(t)\\\\).\n\nIf an additional modulation \\\\(x(t) = x_0(t) \\cdot e^{i\\eta t}\\\\) is applied to the input signal at a time \\\\(t_1 < T\\\\), where \\\\(\\eta\\\\) is a constant, will \\\\(z(T)\\\\)'s predominant frequency component still be \\\\(\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by the modulation with \\\\(e^{i\\eta t}\\\\) shifts the frequency spectrum of the input signal. Thus, the major component of frequency in \\\\(z(T)\\\\) will now be a summation or difference between \\\\(\\omega\\\\) and \\\\(\\eta\\\\), rather than just \\\\(\\omega\\\\), thereby affecting the output spectrum at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input signal x(t) directly influences z(T). Modulating x(t) with x_0(t) * e^(iηt) changes x(t), which in turn affects z(T). The frequency component ω in z(T) is primarily determined by the integral's exponential factor e^(iωs), independent of the modulation frequency η."
