  "Problem": "Imagine we are studying a linear system of differential equations represented by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a constant coefficient matrix. To examine the behavior under different transformations, we introduce the function \\\\( g(x) = x^T Qx \\\\), a quadratic form where Q is a symmetric constant matrix.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) after unknown interventions at unknown times, can we determine precisely which transformation, \\\\( g(x) \\\\) or \\\\( h(x) \\\\), or both were applied?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple paths can converge to the same endpoint under different transformations due to the linearity of the system and the variety of effects introduced by the quadratic and linear transformations. Without specific knowledge of the interventions (both type and timing), identifying what was used uniquely is uncertain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
