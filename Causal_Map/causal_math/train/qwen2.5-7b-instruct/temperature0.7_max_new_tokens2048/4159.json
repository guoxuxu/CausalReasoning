  "Problem": "Consider a system of differential equations defined by \\(\\dot{z} = Cz\\), where \\(z \\in \\mathbb{C}^n\\) and \\(C\\) is a complex matrix. We explore the effect of a Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\}\\) applied at a certain time.\n\nIf at some \\(t_1\\), an operation such as another Fourier transform is applied as an intervention, will \\(z(T)\\) at \\(T > t_1\\) uniquely reflect the properties and rules of the original matrix \\(C\\) only?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing another Fourier transform modulates the system differently, adding another layer of transformation. This makes the final state \\(z(T)\\) a combination influenced by \\(C\\), the original \\(\\mathcal{F}\\{z_0\\}\\), and the second Fourier transform. Thus, \\(z(T)\\) depends collectively on multiple factors, not just \\(C\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The matrix C determines the evolution of z over time, and applying a Fourier transform to z at time t1 will change z's behavior such that z(T) for T > t1 no longer uniquely reflects only the properties of C."
