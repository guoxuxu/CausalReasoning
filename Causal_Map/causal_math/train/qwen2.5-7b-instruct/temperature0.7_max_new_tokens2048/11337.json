  "Problem": "Consider a system described by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time that solve the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\), respectively. Interest revolves around how the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t)) \\\\) affects the overall system behavior over time, where A and B are constant matrices.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t)) \\\\) is computed at t = 0, and then the system evolves under \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\) without further intervention, will the result \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) at t = T correspond to the direct Fourier transform of \\\\( u(T) + iv(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Computing the Fourier transform at t=0 provides a frequency-domain representation of the initial condition. The evolution under \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\) causes transformations in both u and v that are not captured just by their initial transforms. Therefore, the Fourier transform of the final state will involve contributions from both the dynamics dictated by A and B and will differ from the initial transform.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The values of u(t) and v(t) at time t=T directly determine z(T), which in turn determines Z(ω) through its Fourier transform. The constants A and B influence u(t) and v(t) respectively, and the initial Fourier transform at t=0 influences Z(ω) only if there is no change between t=0 and t=T."
