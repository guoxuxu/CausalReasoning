  "Problem": "Assess the role of the Laplace transform in a system governed by the partial differential equation \\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\nabla^2 u \\), where D is a diffusion constant. Analyze the outcomes when the function \\( h(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s + \\\\alpha} \\) (where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a positive constant) is applied as a Laplace transform modifier at initial and various times.\n\nKnowing only the final state \\( u(x,T) \\), is it possible to determine exactly which modifications (either \\( h(s) \\), \\( i(s) \\), both, or none) were applied throughout the development?",
  "Explanation": "Given that both \\( h(s) \\) and \\( i(s) \\) introduce exponential factors that can overlap in effects and due to non-linear properties of the system's behavior under Laplace modifiers, it's impossible to definitively reverse engineer which modifiers have been applied from the end state alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The diffusion constant D influences the rate of change of u with respect to time and the Laplacian of u. The function h(s) = 1/(s + α) modifies the Laplace transform U(s) of u(x,t), and knowing the final state u(x,T) can indicate which modifications, if any, were applied."
