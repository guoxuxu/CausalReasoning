  "Problem": "Consider a set of functions defined by complex mappings \\\\( z = f(w) = e^{iw} \\\\) where w is a complex number and i is the imaginary unit. The system evolves under the transformation \\\\( z(t) = f(w(t)) \\\\), with \\\\( w(t) = g + ht \\\\) where g and h are complex constants.\n\nCan we determine exactly what transformations were applied (either \\\\( f(w) \\\\), \\\\( f'(w) \\\\), or both) given the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) by merely knowing the outcome?",
  "Explanation": "The possibility of achieving the same final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) through different permutations and combinations of transformations (considering their complex exponential nature) makes it challenging to unambiguously deduce the interventions based solely on the final state.",
