  "Problem": "Consider a function defined over the complex plane \\\\( z \\\\) described by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z^t dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex parameter. We explore the effects on \\\\( f(z) \\\\) when \\\\( z \\\\) is transformed by a linear function \\\\( g(z) = az + b \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are constants.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) transforms \\\\( z \\\\) initially and then \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is computed over time without further intervention, does the transformation affect subsequent values of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) compared to direct computation of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) on untransformed \\\\( z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) = az + b \\\\) alters the argument of the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\), and since the integral transformation in \\\\( f(z) \\\\) depends explicitly on \\\\( z \\\\), any change in \\\\( z \\\\) directly affects the outcome of \\\\( f(z) \\\\). Hence, \\\\( f(az+b) \\\\) generally differs from \\\\( f(z) \\\\).",
