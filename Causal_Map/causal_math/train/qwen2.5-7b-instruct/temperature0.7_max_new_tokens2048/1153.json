  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( z' = Dz \\\\), where D is a linear differential operator. Investigate the influence of a transformation characterised by \\\\( h(z) = z^{k}e^{Ct} \\\\) on the behavior of \\\\( z(x) \\\\), where k is a non-zero scalar and C is a constant.\n\nIf an initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is subjected to the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at x = 0, followed by evolution under \\\\( z' = Dz \\\\) without further interventions, will \\\\( z(x) \\\\) at x = X be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to x = X under \\\\( z' = Dz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) changes the initial state by transforming \\\\( z_0 \\\\) into \\\\( z_0^{k}e^{Ct} \\\\). The modified initial condition affects the trajectory as per the given differential equation, leading to a distinct state at x = X.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation h(z) directly influences z(x), and the differential equation z' = Dz governs the evolution of z(x). The initial condition z_0 directly determines the value of z(x) at x = 0, and the evolution under z' = Dz determines the value of z(x) at any x without further interventions."
