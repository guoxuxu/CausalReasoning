  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t satisfying the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z = Az \\\\), and A is a complex number. We analyze the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( Tz = \\\\int_0^t e^{B(t-\\\\tau)}z(\\\\tau)d\\\\tau \\\\), where B is another complex number.\n\nIf the function \\\\( Tz \\\\) is applied to an initial state \\\\( z(0) \\\\), and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z = Az \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z(0) \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z = Az \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( Tz \\\\) changes the initial condition influenced by the integral transformation, which integrates the modified behavior over the interval from 0 to T. This will impact the trajectory and ultimately the end state at t = T due to the contribution of \\\\( e^{B(t-\\\\tau)} \\\\) across all previous points.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the integral transformation Tz to the initial state z(0) and then evolving it under the differential equation dz/dt = Az from time 0 to T results in the same z(T) as directly evolving z(0) under the same differential equation from 0 to T. The parameters A and B respectively govern the evolution and transformation."
