  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\(z(t)\\) described by the differential equation \\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\omega z\\), where \\(i\\) is the imaginary unit, and \\(\\omega\\) is a real constant frequency. Now analyze the impact of the integral transformation defined by \\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{-i\\omega s}z(s)ds \\) over time \\(t\\).\n\nIf, at a specific time \\( t_1 \\) within the interval [0, T], an intervention is applied in the form of another transformation \\( Q(z) = \\int_0^{t_1} e^{i\\omega s}z(s)ds \\), will the endpoint \\( T(z(T)) \\) only depend on the initial differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\( Q(z) \\) during the dynamics introduces additional complexity by altering the overall state of \\( z(t) \\) up to \\( t_1 \\), modifying it with \\( e^{i\\omega s} \\). This affects the subsequent evolution under \\( T(z) \\) in a way that results in an endpoint \\( T(z(T)) \\) dependent on both the original dynamics and the intervention \\( Q(z) \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The frequency ω directly influences z(t) through the differential equation, which in turn directly influences T(z(t)). The time t_1 influences Q(z(t)), which also directly influences T(z(T)). Therefore, T(z(T)) depends on both T(z(t)) and Q(z(t))."
