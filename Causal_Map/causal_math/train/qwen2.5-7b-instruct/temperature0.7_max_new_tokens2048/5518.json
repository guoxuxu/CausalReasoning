  "Problem": "Analyze a system modeled by the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), denoted as \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{g(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), where \\\\( g(t) = e^{At}x_0 \\\\) with \\\\( A \\\\) being a constant matrix and \\\\( x_0 \\\\) the initial condition. We consider the impact of applying a convolution with another function \\\\( h(t) = e^{Bt}x_1 \\\\), resulting in a new function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) given by the inverse Laplace transform of \\\\( F(s) = G(s)H(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the resultant function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) at any time \\\\( t \\\\), can we uniquely determine the original function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) without knowing whether the convolution with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the explicit knowledge of convolution with \\\\( h(t) \\\\), one cannot uniquely backtrack to \\\\( g(t) \\\\). The resultant function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) could arise from various convolutions of different functions, obscuring the precise characteristics of \\\\( g(t) \\\\).",
