  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t, and governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\frac{du}{dt} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\frac{dv}{dt} = Bv \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. Investigate the effects of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az + iBz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az + iBz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) modifies the initial state. Even though both segments are linear, the interaction of \\\\( C \\\\) with \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) (due to non-commutativity of matrix multiplication) will produce a fundamentally different trajectory for \\\\( z(t) \\\\), resulting in a different state at time T.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of z(t) is governed by the differential equation dz/dt = Az + iBz, which directly influences the changes in u(t) and v(t) through A and B respectively. The transformation f(z) = e^(Ct)*z at t=0 affects the initial condition but does not alter the overall dynamics described by dz/dt = Az + iBz. Therefore, the state of z(t) at t=T after applying f(z) and evolving under the given differential equation will be equivalent to directly evolving z_0 to t=T under the same equation."
