  "Problem": "Consider the process of solving a system of linear equations encoded by matrix operations. Let \\\\( Ax = b \\\\) represent the system with matrix A and vector b. Consider the impact of pre-multiplying both sides by a matrix \\\\( M \\\\) (where M is an invertible matrix).\n\nGiven the transformed system \\\\( M(Ax) = Mb \\\\) and its solution, can we determine the solution to \\\\( Ax = b \\\\) without explicitly knowing M?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of M, it is impossible to exactly ascertain what transformations were applied to \\\\( Ax = b \\\\). Therefore, while the solution to the transformed equation is consistent with that of the original, without M, one cannot reconstruct the original conditions or verify the equivalence directly.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Multiplying both sides of the equation Ax = b by an invertible matrix M results in an equivalent equation M(Ax) = Mb, which has the same solution x as the original equation."
