  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where A is a real constant. We analyze the impact of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{-iBt}z \\\\) over time t, where B is another real constant.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{-iCt}z \\\\) (where C is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on A and not on B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) adds yet another transformation, which alters the state of the system from that point onwards. Therefore, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on B (from the initial transformation), C (from the intervention), and how these interact under the evolution prescribed by A.",
