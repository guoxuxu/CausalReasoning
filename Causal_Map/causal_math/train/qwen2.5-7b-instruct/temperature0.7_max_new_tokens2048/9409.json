  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a differential operator. The system is subject to manipulation by a transformation \\\\(h(u) = u + e^{Kt}\\\\), where \\\\(K\\\\) is a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\(h(u)\\\\) is applied to a function \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) at \\\\(t = 0\\\\) and subsequently left to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(u(t, x)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\) be identical to the scenario where \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) was directly evolved using \\\\(L\\\\) to \\\\(t = T\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(h(u)\\\\) initially modifies the function \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) by adding \\\\(e^{Kt}\\\\), instantly setting it on a different evolution path under the operator \\\\(L\\\\). This modification translates into a fundamentally altered trajectory for \\\\(u(t, x)\\\\) over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation h(u) to u_0(x) at t=0 and then evolving it with L until t=T results in u(t, x) which is different from directly evolving u_0(x) with L from t=0 to t=T."
