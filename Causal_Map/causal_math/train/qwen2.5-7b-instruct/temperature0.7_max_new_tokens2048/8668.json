  "Problem": "In this scenario, we consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz \\\\), where the initial condition is \\\\( z(0) = z_0 \\\\). We explore transformations using the integral operator \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{s^2} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nGiven only the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after some transformations were applied, can we clearly pinpoint which modifications (\\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( G(z) \\\\), or others) were used?",
  "Explanation": "The observed endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could potentially result from various transformations involving different combinations or sequences, owing to the fact that similar resultant function behaviors might be induced by different transformation pathways. Therefore, without additional information, we cannot conclusively identify which interventions were integrated.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
