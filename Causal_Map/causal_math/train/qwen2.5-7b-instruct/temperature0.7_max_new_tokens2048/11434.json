  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(g(z)\\\\) given by \\\\(g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z^t \\\\, dt\\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex number. We analyze the implications of varying the parameter \\\\(s\\\\) in the function and its effect on the transformation of input complex number \\\\(z\\\\).\n\nGiven the value of \\\\(g(z)\\\\) for a fixed \\\\(z\\\\), can we uniquely determine the parameter \\\\(s\\\\) if |z| > 1?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\(g(z)\\\\) does not uniquely determine \\\\(s\\\\) because different values of \\\\(s\\\\) can lead to similar magnitudes of decay in the integral, especially considering different potential phase rotations in \\\\(s\\\\) and complexities in evaluating integrals with complex exponentials.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
