  "Problem": "Consider the operation of convolution on a function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) with a system impulse response \\\\(h(t)\\\\) producing the output \\\\(y(t)\\\\). We explore the causality implications of this convolution under a transformation defined by \\\\( g(t) = f(t) * F(t) \\\\) where \\\\( F(t) \\\\) is another kernel function.\n\nIf an intervention is done by modifying the kernel \\\\( F(t) \\\\) at some point during the convolution process, will the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) depend solely on the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without being affected by the original or modified \\\\( F(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Altering \\\\( F(t) \\\\) during the convolution changes the input's structure therefore affecting the outcome. The intervention influences the final \\\\( y(t) \\\\) by transforming the intermediate or final stages of convolution, making it dependent on both the nature of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and the kernel function \\\\( F(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
