  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) and its transformation by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), yielding a new function defined as \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). We examine the functional relation \\\\( s \\\\) as it affects the behavior of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) over the complex s-plane.\n\nIf the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) is transformed by the Laplace transform without any parameter modifications, will \\\\( F(s) \\\\) for a special case where \\\\( s \\\\) is a real positive number be simply \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-1} \\\\), assuming s > 1?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( e^{t} \\\\), which is a specific format of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) with \\\\( z = t \\\\), results directly in \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-1} \\\\) for \\\\( s > 1 \\\\). Here, no intervention changes the base function, thus the transformation follows the standard Laplace property where the transformation of exponential function is \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), with \\\\( a = 1 \\\\) in this case.",
