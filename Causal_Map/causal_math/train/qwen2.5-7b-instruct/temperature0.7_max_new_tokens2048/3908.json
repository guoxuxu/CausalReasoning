  "Problem": "Consider the application of complex function mapping \\\\( z \\mapsto w = e^{z} \\\\) in the complex plane and its implications on the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( f(t) \\) defined for \\\\( t \\geq 0 \\\\). The Laplace transform is given by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed Laplace transform \\\\( G(w) \\\\) after an unknown intervention on \\\\( f(t) \\\\), can we determine precisely what the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) was, knowing only \\\\( G(w) \\\\) and that the variable transformation \\\\( w = e^{s} \\\\) was used?",
  "Explanation": "Without precise details about the nature of the intervention or the original function, and with the additional complication of the variable transformation, it is generally impossible to uniquely determine the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from the transformed output \\\\( G(w) \\\\). Variables transformations and functional modifications without baseline comparatives lead to irreversible information loss.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
