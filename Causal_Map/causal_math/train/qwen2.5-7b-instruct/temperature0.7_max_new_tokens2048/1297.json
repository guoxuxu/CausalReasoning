  "Problem": "We investigate a system governed by a complex function \\\\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\\\), where \\\\\\( A \\\\\\) represents a matrix with complex entries and \\\\\\( z_0 \\\\\\) is a vector in the complex plane. The transformation \\\\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\\\) with a constant matrix \\\\\\( D \\\\\\) is then applied to \\\\\\( z(t) \\\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\\\( h(z) \\\\\\) is applied to \\\\\\( z_0 \\\\\\) at \\\\\\( t = 0 \\\\\\) and then allowed to evolve under \\\\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z \\\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\\\( z(T) \\\\\\) at \\\\\\( T \\\\\\) be the same as if \\\\\\( z_0 \\\\\\) just evolved to \\\\\\( T \\\\\\) under \\\\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z \\\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\\\( h(z) \\\\\\) modifies the initial condition, \\\\\\( z_0 \\\\\\), to \\\\\\( h(z_0) = e^{D0}z_0 = z_0 \\\\\\) at \\\\\\( t = 0 \\\\\\). However, if \\\\\\( D \\\\\\) and \\\\\\( A \\\\\\) do not commute, the evolving trajectory of \\\\\\( z \\\\\\) will differ due to non-commutative effects in the matrix exponential multiplication, leading to different outcomes at \\\\\\( T \\\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying h(z) to z_0 at t=0 and then allowing z to evolve under z(t) = e^(At)z for time T results in z(T) being influenced by both A and D, while z_0 evolving solely under z(t) = e^(At)z for time T is only influenced by A."
