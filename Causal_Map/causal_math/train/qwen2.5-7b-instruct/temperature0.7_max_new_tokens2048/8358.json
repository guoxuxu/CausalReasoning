  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We examine the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) to the function u, denoted as \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(s,t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x,t))(s)\\\\), on the behavior of the system over time t.\n\nCan we accurately reconstruct the original function \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) from \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(s,T)\\\\) at time T without knowing whether \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of initial transformation, the alterations imposed by L in the evolution process obscure the original conditions. The transformation might be non-invertible or lead to loss of information that prevents precise reconstruction.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
