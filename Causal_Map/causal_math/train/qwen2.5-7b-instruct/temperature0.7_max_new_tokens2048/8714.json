  "Problem": "Examine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix \\\\(A\\\\) and their changes after the matrix undergoes a linear transformation \\\\( T(A) = B^{-1}AB \\\\), where \\\\(B\\\\) is an invertible matrix.\n\nKnowing the eigenvalues of the transformed matrix \\\\( T(A) = B^{-1}AB \\\\), can the eigenvalues of the original matrix \\\\( A \\\\) be exactly determined?",
  "Explanation": "Since the eigenvalues are preserved under similarity transformations, knowing the eigenvalues of \\\\( T(A) \\\\) provides the exact eigenvalues of the original matrix \\\\( A \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The eigenvalues of the original matrix A remain unchanged after the linear transformation T(A) = B^(-1)AB, so knowing the eigenvalues of the transformed matrix T(A) allows us to determine the eigenvalues of the original matrix A."
