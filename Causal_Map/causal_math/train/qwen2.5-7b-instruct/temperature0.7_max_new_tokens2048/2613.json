  "Problem": "Consider the effects of applying a complex transformation \\\\( z \\mapsto e^{iw}z \\\\) on a vector field governed by a Laplace equation \\(-\\Delta u = 0\\). We are examining the system's response over time and the causal inference of operations.\n\nIf a complex transformation \\\\( z \\mapsto e^{iw}z \\\\) is applied to a field configuration \\\\( u(z, 0) \\\\) at time t = 0, and then the field evolves based on the Laplace equation without any intervention, will the field distribution \\\\( u(z, T) \\\\) at time T be identical to the one that would result from evolving \\\\( u(z, 0) \\\\) directly under the Laplace equation without the initial transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation modifies the initial condition, which is crucial for the evolution under the Laplace equation. The transformation introduces a phase shift that affects how derivatives and boundary conditions are interpreted, leading to distinct outcomes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation z → u(z, 0) and then evolving u(z, 0) → u(z, T) under the Laplace equation results in the same field distribution as directly evolving u(z, 0) → u(z, T) under the Laplace equation without the transformation."
