  "Problem": "Investigate a situation where the effectiveness of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) is applied to a signal analyzed using the Fourier Transform. The Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) provides a method to convert the time-domain signal into the frequency-domain representation.\n\nCan we determine the original time-domain signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) after applying \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and observing its Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) without knowing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge that \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was applied, the changed frequency spectrum observed through \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) will not directly indicate the original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\). The frequency shift introduced by \\\\( z(t) \\\\) obscures the original characteristics of \\\\( x(t) \\\\), making it impossible to deduce without further information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
