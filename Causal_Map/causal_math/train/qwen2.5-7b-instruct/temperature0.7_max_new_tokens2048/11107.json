  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = t^2 + i \\\\cdot t \\\\) where \\\\( t \\\\) is a real number and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. Let's explore the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t z(s) \\\\, ds \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( s \\\\), \\\\( s_1 \\\\), an additional function \\\\( u(s) = s^3 \\\\) is introduced and added to \\\\( z(s) \\\\), and then \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied from \\\\( s_1 \\\\) to T, will the resulting \\\\( T(z(T)) \\\\) be influenced solely by the transformation \\\\( z(t) = t^2 + i \\\\cdot t \\\\) and not by the introduction of \\\\( s^3 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( u(s) = s^3 \\\\) alters the function being integrated from time \\\\( s_1 \\\\) to T, affecting the results of the integral transformation, \\\\( T(z) \\\\). The final outcome \\\\( T(z(T)) \\\\) is therefore dependent on both the initial function and the intervention by \\\\( u(s) \\\\).",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation T(z) is influenced by the function z(t) = t^2 + i * t, and introducing u(s) = s^3 does not affect T(z) if it is only applied from s1 onwards. s1 marks the start of the integration for T(z), so changes in z(s) before s1 do not influence T(z(T))."
