  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iw_0 t} \\\\), where \\\\( w_0 \\\\) is a real constant and t represents time. This function is subject to transformations by applying a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) which is an integral transform with kernel function \\\\( K(t, s) \\\\).\n\nIf the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at some initial time and the system evolves naturally under the same function without further intervention, will the resulting function at time T still be represented as \\\\( z(T) = e^{iw_0 T} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) changes the initial function configuration by transforming it according to the kernel \\\\( K(t, s) \\\\). This transformation generally modulates or alters the frequency components of the original function, leading to a different form at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
