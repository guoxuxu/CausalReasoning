  "Problem": "Analyze the influence of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) on the stability of a linear system defined by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax \\\\), where A is a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) multiplies an initial condition \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax \\\\) without further intervention, will the evolved state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for some T > 0 be the direct multiplication of \\\\( e^{iT} \\\\) with the state that would evolve from \\\\( x_0 \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying the initial condition by \\\\( e^{it} \\\\) implies that the phase of \\\\( x_0 \\\\) is changed, which modifies how the system evolves under A. Due to the properties of matrix exponentials and complex multiplication, the resulting state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is affected both by A and the initial modification, not just a direct application of \\\\( e^{iT} \\\\) to the unmodified evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
