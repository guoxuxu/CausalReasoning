  "Problem": "Consider a complex plane transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The differential equation governing the dynamics is \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\lambda z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it's impossible to ascertain whether the observed \\\\( z(t) \\\\) comes from the pathway \\\\( e^{-i\\\\lambda t}z_0 \\\\) or \\\\( e^{-i\\\\lambda t}e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\). The potential phase shift introduced by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) obscures the original value of \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial value of z at t=0 (z(0)) directly influences the value of z at any later time t=T (z(T)). The constant λ directly influences the rate of change of z with respect to time (dz/dt). The constant ω indirectly influences z(T) through the transformation function f(z)."
