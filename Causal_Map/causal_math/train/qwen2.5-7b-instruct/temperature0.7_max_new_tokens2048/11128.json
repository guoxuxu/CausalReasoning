  "Problem": "Analyze a complex system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz\\\\), where A is a constant matrix and i represents the imaginary unit. Consider the transformation \\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\) where C is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the state \\( z(T) \\), can we determine precisely which interventions were used (whether \\( g(z) \\), \\( h(z) \\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of interventions involving \\( g(z) \\) and \\( h(z) \\), as well as different initial conditions modified by these interventions, can lead to the same final state \\( z(T) \\), especially considering that matrix exponentials might not uniquely determine their own inverses without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state z(0) directly causes the state z(T), and the constant matrix C directly causes the transformation g(z). The rate of change of z is directly caused by the matrix A."
