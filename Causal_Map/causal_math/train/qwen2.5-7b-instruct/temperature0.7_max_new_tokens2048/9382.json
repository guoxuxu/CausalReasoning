  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. We analyze the application of the Laplace transform on this function and its inverse to determine system behavior over time.\n\nFrom observing the Laplace transform of function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), can we precisely deduce the value and nature of \\\\( a \\\\) in the original function \\\\( e^{at} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) is \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), providing a unique signature directly indicating the presence and exact value of \\\\( a \\\\) in the original function based on the pole of the transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
