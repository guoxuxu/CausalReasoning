  "Problem": "Consider a system modelled by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t. The impact of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s}z(s) ds \\\\) is analyzed.\n\nIf the integral transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z \\\\) at time t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the natural dynamics of \\\\( z \\\\), will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for another time T > 0 be the same as if no transformation was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the integral transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) initially affects the entire subsequent trajectory of the function because the transformation is influenced by the integral of the past states weighted by \\\\( e^{-s} \\\\). This memory effect ensures that even for T > 0, the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) differs from what it would have been without the application of T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The integral transformation T(z) directly influences the value of z at time T, and the natural evolution of z from t=0 to T also directly influences the value of z at time T."
