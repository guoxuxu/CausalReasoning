  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{az} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. We examine the effect of applying an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) on \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and its implications over the variable \\\\( s \\\\).\n\nGiven the result of the integral transformation \\\\( T[g](s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) for a particular \\\\( s \\\\), can we deduce the exact value of \\\\( a \\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing \\\\( T[g](s) \\\\) as \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), the exact value of \\\\( a \\\\) can be directly deduced as the value that satisfies this equation for given \\\\( s \\\\). The parameter \\\\( a \\\\) is singularly responsible for the form of the resulting function from the transformation.",
