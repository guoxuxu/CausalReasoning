  "Problem": "Consider an integral equation system defined by \\\\( y(x) = \\\\int_0^x K(x,t) y(t) dt \\\\) where K is a kernel function involving complex operations. We evaluate the impact of modifying the kernel to \\\\( K'(x,t) = K(x,t) \\\\cdot e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf an intervention processed at a certain point, \\\\( x_1 \\\\), modifies \\\\( K(x,t) \\\\) to a new kernel \\\\( K''(x,t) = K(x,t) + \\\\alpha \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\), will the solution \\\\( y(x) \\\\) at any \\\\( x > x_1 \\\\) depend solely on the original kernel K?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the kernel and consequently affects the entire solution path from \\\\( x_1 \\\\) onwards. The added sinusoidal term introduces new dynamics into the integral equation, making the outcome dependent not only on the original kernel K but also on the modified kernel \\\\( K'' \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The kernel K directly influences y(x), K' directly influences y(x), and K'' directly influences y(x). Modifying K to K'' introduces an additional term that depends on time t, which could affect y(x) for x > x_1."
