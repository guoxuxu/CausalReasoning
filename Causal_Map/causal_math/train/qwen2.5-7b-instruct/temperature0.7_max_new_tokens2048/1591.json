  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\), where D is a constant matrix. We investigate the effect of applying a transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(x) = K(t)x \\\\) over time t, where K(t) is a time-dependent matrix.\n\nIf an intervention by a function \\\\( m(x) = J(t)x \\\\) (where J(t) is another time-dependent matrix) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resulting state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on D and not on K(t) or J(t)?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing \\\\( m(x) \\\\) as an intervention modifies the trajectory again, causing the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) to depend on D, K(t), and J(t). The impact of these matrix functions through their potential non-commutative interactions affects the system dynamics, thereby influencing the outcome at T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state x(t) is directly caused by D through the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\). K(t) and J(t) directly cause x(t) at different times, but they do not influence the state x(T) for T > t_1 once the intervention m(x) = J(t)x has been applied at t_1."
