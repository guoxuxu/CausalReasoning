  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of an electrical system characterized by a complex impedance function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) in the Laplace domain, where \\\\( s \\\\) is the complex frequency. We explore the effect of applying a Laplace transform to the time-domain voltage function \\\\( v(t) = V_0 e^{at} \\\\), with \\\\( V_0 \\\\) and \\\\( a \\\\) being constants.\n\nCan we accurately trace back to determine if the original function was \\\\( v(t) \\\\) or the interventional function \\\\( w(t) \\\\) by solely examining \\\\( I(s) \\\\) at any frequency domain point \\\\( s = p \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The complexity introduced by the intervention makes it challenging to distinguish whether \\\\( I(s) \\\\) at \\\\( s = p \\\\) arises from \\\\( v(t) \\\\) or \\\\( w(t) \\\\). The lack of exclusive indicators or specific features inherent to \\\\( v(t) \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) \\\\) in the transform domain precludes unequivocal determination of the source function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
