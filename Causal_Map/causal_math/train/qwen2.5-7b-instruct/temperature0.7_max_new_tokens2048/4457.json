  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{At}x \\\\) where C is a complex function of a vector \\\\( x \\\\), and A is a constant matrix. The evolution of the function over time illustrates how x migrates through the transformation dictated by \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) and complex modulation by C.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) starts with an initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and evolves without any further modifications under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Az + Cz\\\\), will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T differ from its evolution under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Az\\\\) only?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the complex function C modifies the usual exponential trajectory induced by A alone. The term \\\\( Cz \\\\) contributes additional growth or decay dynamics dependent on the properties of C, thus altering the trajectory from what would be obtained by \\\\( e^{At}x_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial vector x_0, the constant matrix A, and the complex function C each directly cause the state z(t) at any given time t. The evolution of z(t) from t=0 to T under the differential equation \\(\\dot{z} = Az + Cz\\) will differ from its evolution under \\(\\dot{z} = Az\\) solely due to the influence of C."
