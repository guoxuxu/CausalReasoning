  "Problem": "Consider a stochastic process described by the integral transformation \\\\( X(s) = \\\\int_0^s K(s, t) Y(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( Y(t) \\\\) is a Brownian motion process and \\\\( K(s, t) \\\\) is a deterministic kernel function. We assess the impact of modifying the kernel function \\\\( K(s, t) \\\\) through the transformation \\\\( K_{new}(s, t) = e^{At}K(s, t) \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( K_{int}(s, t) = e^{Bt}K(s, t) \\\\) (where \\\\( B \\\\) is another constant) is applied at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) within the interval [0, T], will \\\\( X_{new}(T) \\\\) depend solely on the initial kernel \\\\( K(s, t) \\\\) and not on the transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The additional transformation of the kernel function introduces another alteration in the process. As a result, the final state \\\\( X_{new}(T) \\\\) will be influenced by both transformations \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\), complicating the influence of the original kernel and not solely depending on it.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
