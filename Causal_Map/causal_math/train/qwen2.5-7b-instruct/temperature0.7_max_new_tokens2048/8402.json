  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by the integral transform \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s^2} h(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( h(s) \\\\) is a given real function. We evaluate scenarios where \\\\( h(s) \\\\) is modified by transformations such as \\\\( f(h)(s) = h(s) + s^3 \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( h(s) \\\\) at time s = 0 correctly after computing \\\\( z(t) \\\\), without knowing whether \\\\( f(h) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\\\( z(t) \\\\) computed from potentially modified \\\\( h(s) \\\\), we cannot uniquely determine whether the modification (i.e., addition of \\\\( s^3 \\\\)) was included just from observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Without knowing the transformation, the original form of \\\\( h(s) \\\\) remains uncertain.",
