  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution in a rod, denoted by \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\), is governed by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. To study the effects of external factors, an intervention is modeled by multiplying the initial temperature distribution by a function \\\\(h(x) = e^{-ax}\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), a new function \\\\(f(x) = e^{-bx}\\\\) (where \\\\(b\\\\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) depend solely on the heat equation's diffusivity \\\\(k\\\\) and not on \\\\(a\\\\) or \\\\(b\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions with both \\\\(h(x)\\\\) and \\\\(f(x)\\\\) introduce new modifying factors affecting the temperature distribution at time \\\\(T\\\\). Both the scale and the nature of the initial and mid-point manipulations will significantly influence the final state of the system, overlaying the natural diffusion process described by the heat equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The endpoint u(x, T) depends on the thermal diffusivity k and the interventions h(x) and f(x), but once the heat equation has been applied over time, the specific form of the interventions h(x) and f(x) does not further influence u(x, T) beyond the initial conditions."
