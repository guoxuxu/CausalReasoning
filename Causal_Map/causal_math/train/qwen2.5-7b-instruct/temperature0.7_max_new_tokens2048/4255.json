  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit RLC series where \\\\(R, L, C\\\\) represent resistance, inductance, and capacitance, respectively. Let the input voltage \\\\(V(t)\\\\) be a sinusoidal function described by \\\\(V(t) = V_0 \\\\cos(\\\\omega t)\\\\) where \\\\(V_0\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) are constants. Investigate how the output current \\\\(I(t)\\\\) changes when subjected to the Laplace transform, which encodes different input conditions or interventions.\n\nIf an additional impulse voltage \\\\(U(t) = U_0 \\\\delta(t - t_1)\\\\) where \\\\(U_0\\\\) is a constant, and \\\\(\\\\delta\\\\) is the Dirac delta function, is applied at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will this perturbation's effect on the circuit's total response to \\\\(V(t)\\\\) at time T > t_1 be independent of \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the impulse voltage introduces an immediate change in the charge and current conditions, affecting the total system dynamics including transient oscillations and damping, which in turn depend on \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) reflecting the original sinusoidal input's influence.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
