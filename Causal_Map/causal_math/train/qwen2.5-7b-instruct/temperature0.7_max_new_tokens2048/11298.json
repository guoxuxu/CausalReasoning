  "Problem": "Examine the response of a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 f = 0\\\\) in a two-dimensional domain. Consider applying the Fourier transform \\\\(F(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty f(x) e^{-ikx} dx\\\\) to the function \\\\(f(x, y)\\\\) and then analyzing its evolution under a given boundary condition transformation.\n\nCan we reconstruct the initial function \\\\(f_0(x, y)\\\\) accurately by observing \\\\(f(x, y, t)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\) without knowing if a Fourier transform was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the initial application of the Fourier transform, it is difficult to backtrack the changes induced by spatial to frequency domain transformations, especially since boundary conditions might alter the natural evolution of the original system in unpredictable ways.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function f(x, y, t) evolves over time and can be Fourier transformed to F(k). Knowing f(x, y, T) allows us to potentially reconstruct the initial function f0(x, y), but this reconstruction depends on the application of the Fourier transform."
