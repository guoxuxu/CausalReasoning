  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function describes an oscillatory system in the complex plane. We examine the effects of the Laplace transformation \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\\\) on this system and its implications on the causal inference.\n\nIf the system is initially described by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), and it evolves according to this form without further intervention, will the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time T (computed as \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\{ z(t) \\} (s) = \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\\\)) remain the same irrespective of any changes in \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) results in \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\{ z(t) \\} (s) = \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\\\), which clearly depends on the value of \\\\( \\omega \\\\). Therefore, any change in \\\\( \\omega \\\\) alters the Laplace transform, indicating different system characteristics in the frequency domain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
