  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + az + b \\\\) in the complex plane, where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants. We explore the effect of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = cz + d \\\\) applied at time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\) are also complex constants.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( w \\\\) derived from the sequence \\\\( f(h(g(z_0))) \\\\), is it possible to ascertain which transformations (\\\\( g \\\\), \\\\( h \\\\), or both) were involved by only having the final value \\\\( w \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the potential for different combinations of parameters and transformations to yield the same endpoint under non-linear functions, it is impossible to pinpoint the exact sequence of transformations from the endpoint alone. Multiple combinations of \\\\( g \\\\) and \\\\( h \\\\) might have resulted in the same final value \\\\( w \\\\), especially considering their independent parameters and the complex plane's properties.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation g applied to z_0 leads to h(g(z_0)), which is then transformed by f to produce w."
