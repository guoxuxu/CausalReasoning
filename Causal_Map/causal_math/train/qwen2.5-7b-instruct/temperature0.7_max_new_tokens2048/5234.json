  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} + k z = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the impact of a linear transformation given by matrix \\\\( M = \\\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\\\\\ c & d \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\) applied to the components \\\\( (x, y) \\\\) of \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original vector components \\\\( (x_0, y_0) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( M \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( M \\\\), reconstructing the initial conditions \\\\( (x_0, y_0) \\\\) solely from the observed end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is indeterminate. The altered path due to the linear transformation \\\\( M \\\\) introduces ambiguity, making it impossible to uniquely identify the original state without additional information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
