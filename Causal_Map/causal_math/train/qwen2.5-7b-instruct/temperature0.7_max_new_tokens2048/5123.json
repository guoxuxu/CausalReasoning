  "Problem": "Consider the effect of a complex function \\\\( w(z) = e^{kz} \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant, on a field defined by \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\) over the complex plane. The function transforms the complex variable \\\\( z = x + iy \\\\) over time, under linear transformation \\\\( T(v) = Av \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(z) = e^{mz} \\\\) (where \\\\( m \\\\) is another complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\) at time T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( k \\\\) or \\\\( m \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) = e^{mz} \\\\) introduces an additional modifying factor, making the final state \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\) at time T a function not only of \\\\( A \\\\) but also significantly influenced by both \\\\( k \\\\) and \\\\( m \\\\). The impact of the complex exponential transformations due to \\\\( k \\\\) and \\\\( m \\\\) would profoundly alter the development and outcome in the complex field.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The endpoint u(x, y) depends on the transformations applied to z, which include w(z) and h(z), and the linear transformation T(v). These transformations are mediated through z, and thus u(x, y) is influenced by k, m, and A."
