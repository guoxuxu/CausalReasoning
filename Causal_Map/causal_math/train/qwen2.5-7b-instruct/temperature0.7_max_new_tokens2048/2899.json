  "Problem": "Consider a system where complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolves according to the rule \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant complex matrix. To investigate the relationship, we introduce a transformation with the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is another constant complex matrix.\n\nAssuming at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), we introduce another function \\\\( j(z) = e^{Et}z \\\\) (where \\\\( E \\\\) is a constant complex matrix) as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be unaffected by matrices \\\\( D \\\\) and \\\\( E \\\\) and depend only on \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( j(z) \\\\) during the progression introduces an additional complex plane transformation that alters the trajectory and dependencies. Thus, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) reflects the influences not only from \\\\( C \\\\) but significantly from \\\\( D \\\\) and \\\\( E \\\\) as well, each affecting the complex function evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The final state z(T) is influenced by the constant complex matrix C through the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\). The initial state z(t1) is affected by both matrices D and E through the transformations h(z) and j(z) respectively, but these do not directly influence z(T) if we consider only the given causal links."
