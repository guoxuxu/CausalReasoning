  "Problem": "Consider a complex analysis problem where the function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) is transformed using an integral along a contour \\\\( C \\\\). The contour \\\\( C \\\\) is specified to be the unit circle in the complex plane. Assume that the variable transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied to modify the path of integration.\n\nIf a further transformation, \\\\( i(z) = e^{iz} \\\\), is applied as an intervention during the integration process, will the resulting value of the integral over \\\\( h(z)(C) \\\\) depend solely on the properties of \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The added transformation \\\\( i(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) during the integration introduces another layer of modification to the integration path and potentially the function's values at different points in the contour. This makes the final integral value dependent on \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( i(z) \\\\), and \\\\( g(z) \\\\), not just \\\\( g(z) \\\\). The effects of these transformations on the path and function values are non-trivial and dependent on their specific mathematical properties.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of the integral over h(z)(C) depends on g(z) and i(z) because h(z) transforms the contour C to C_transformed, and i(z) introduces an additional factor in the integrand. Therefore, the integral_value is influenced by both g(z) and the combined effect of h(z) and i(z)."
