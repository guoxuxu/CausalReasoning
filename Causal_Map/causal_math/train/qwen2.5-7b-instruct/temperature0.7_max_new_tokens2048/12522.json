  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) in which both x and y are differentiable real-valued functions of t. We apply a transformation \\\\( w(z) = e^{iAt}z \\\\) where A is a constant real number and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit.\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another function \\\\( u(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\) (where B is a different constant) is applied as an intervention, will the resulting \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 solely depend on A and not on B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( u(z) \\\\) introduces a secondary phase-altering factor, influencing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on both the transformations via A and B. Each transformation modifies the phase differently, thereby affecting the ultimate state at time T.",
