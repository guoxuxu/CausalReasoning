  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations modulated by a stochastic process defined as \\\\( dX_t = AX_t dt + dB_t \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( B_t \\\\) is a Brownian motion. We are interested in the behavior of \\\\( X_t \\\\) under the transformation \\\\( f(X) = e^{Ct}X \\\\) for a constant matrix \\\\( C \\\\), and the integral transform \\\\( F(X_t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-(t-s)A}X_s ds \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(X) \\\\) is applied to a state \\\\( X_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve as \\\\( dX_t = AX_t dt + dB_t \\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( X(T) \\\\) at time T be influenced by the matrix \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(X) \\\\) at the initial time alters the starting point of the system with the effect of the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{CT} \\\\). This modified initial condition affects how the solution evolves under the stochastic differential equation, hence the state \\\\( X(T) \\\\) will reflect the influence of both \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The matrix C influences the initial state X_0 through the transformation f, which then affects the state X_t over time."
