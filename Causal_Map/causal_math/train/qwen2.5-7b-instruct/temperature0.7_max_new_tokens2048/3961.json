  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We examine the effects of transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = e^{-\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\) without any further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\), the state at time T, be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) were evolved directly under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state by multiplying it by \\\\( e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\), thus changing the trajectory. Considering that this modification decays the amplitude over time, the state at time T will be different due to the altered dynamics introduced by \\\\( h(z) \\\\).",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state z(0) evolves to z(t) under the differential equation ω → dz/dt, and applying the transformation h(z) = e^(-αt)z at t=0 modifies z(0) to z(t) such that z(T) = e^(-αT)z(0)e^(iωT). Without the transformation, z(0) directly evolves to z(T) = z(0)e^(iωT). Thus, z(T) after transformation and evolution differs from z(T) without transformation unless α = -ω."
