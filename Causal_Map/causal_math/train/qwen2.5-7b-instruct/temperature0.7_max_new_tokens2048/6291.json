  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are constants, and the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) is used to analyze the system's behavior.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_k \\\\), a scaling factor \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is introduced multiplying \\\\( z(t) \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) is then performed, will the system's transformation on the complex plane solely depend on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) as a scaling factor modifies the amplitude of the complex function, impacting the transformed function. The final transformed state will depend on both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and the introduced parameter \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), affecting amplitude and potentially leading to changes in the Laplace domain representation as well.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
