  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear operator L, which transforms functions based on the equation \\\\( L[x(t)] = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} k(s) x(t-s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( k(s) \\\\) is a kernel function. An intervention is applied by modifying the input function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) to a new function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) at a certain point after the initial condition.\n\nGiven the output function at t = T, can we determine precisely what input function was used (whether \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\), \\\\( h(t) \\\\), or both), solely by knowing the output and assuming the properties of k are such that L is invertible?",
  "Explanation": "Even with an invertible L, the time at which the input function was switched from \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\) to \\\\( h(t) \\\\) can vastly influence the output. The overlap in the possible influence of both inputs on the output, given changes in the input function at t_1, results in several potential scenarios yielding similar outputs, thus confounding the exact identification of the input function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The output function at t = T is determined by the transformation of either the original input function x(t) or the modified input function h(t) through the linear operator L, given that L is invertible."
