  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\(f(z) = e^{z}\\\\) is applied and then \\\\(z\\\\) evolves according to the dynamics \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Az\\\\) in the complex plane, where \\\\(A\\\\) is a complex number acting as a constant multiplier.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Az\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Az\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) fundamentally alters the trajectory by changing the initial condition. The nonlinear nature of \\\\( e^z \\\\) in the complex plane means that starting from an altered initial condition \\\\( e^{z_0} \\\\) rather than \\\\( z_0 \\\\) leads to a different trajectory under the same dynamics \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Az\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying f(z) to z_0 at t=0 and then evolving z under \\(\\dot{z} = Az\\) results in the same z(T) as directly evolving z_0 to t=T under \\(\\dot{z} = Az\\), given that z(t) and z(T) are influenced by both z_0 and A."
