  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz + N\\\\), where M is a constant matrix and N is a constant vector. The system is subjected to an integral transformation given by \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Mt'}N dt' \\\\).\n\nCan we determine the initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "If we are unaware whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, the additional term introduced by \\\\( h(z) \\\\) cannot be disentangled from the overall behavior derived solely from \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz + N\\\\). Different initial conditions can result in the same observed outcome at T due to the integration effect, making reverse causation infeasible without additional information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
