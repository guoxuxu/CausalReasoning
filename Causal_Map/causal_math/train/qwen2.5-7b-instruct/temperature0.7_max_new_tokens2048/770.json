  "Problem": "Consider a function defined as \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{izt} g(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( g(t) \\\\) represents a function of time. This scenario deals with the Fourier transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and explores what happens as this transformation is applied to different functional forms of \\\\( g(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform result \\\\( f(z) \\\\) as a set of Dirac deltas, can we determine that the original function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) was a sine wave without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "While a set of Dirac deltas at specific frequencies highly suggests a sinusoidal original function, without further information, other time-domain functions could theoretically produce similar frequency-domain representations, especially considering phase and amplitude modifications.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
