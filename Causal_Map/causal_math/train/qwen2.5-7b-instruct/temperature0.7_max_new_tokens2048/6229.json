  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where a signal x(t) is subjected to a linear transformation using an operator L. The transformed signal is represented as y(t) = L{x(t)}. Further, an integral transform T defined by T{y(t)} = ∫y(t)e^{-st} dt is applied to y(t).\n\nDoes applying the linear operator L to the signal x(t), followed by the integral transform T, yield the same result as directly applying T to x(t) without first applying L?",
  "Explanation": "The linear operator L modifies the structure of the signal x(t), leading to a new function y(t). The application of the integral transform T on this altered signal typically results in a transformation that cannot be equated to applying T directly to the original x(t), unless L and T have specific compatibility or commutation properties.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
