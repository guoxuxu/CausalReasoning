  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. The function transforms according to another complex function \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\), applied at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\). The system's development is examined over time under the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\), and the results are compared to an untransformed approach.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we definitively ascertain what interventions were applied (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), solely by knowing the endpoint value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The ultimate state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can potentially arise from various combinations of the applications of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\), along with different initial conditions or intervening modifications, creating ambiguity in determining the exact interventions used without more data.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
