  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We evaluate the influence of applying a Fourier transform, where the transform is defined as \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\) is given and the system evolves according to the specified differential equation, will applying the Fourier transform to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) yield the same result as if the transform was applied directly to the initial conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the evolving function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) incorporates the entire history and behavior of the function overtime, influenced by both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\). In contrast, a transform applied directly to the initial condition would not account for the dynamic evolution under the differential equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition z(0) influences the evolution of z(t) over time through the differential equation, which in turn determines the Fourier transform F(ω). Constants ω, k, and i affect the form of z(t) but do not directly cause F(ω); instead, they shape how z(t) changes over time."
