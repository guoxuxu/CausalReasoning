  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(A+iB)t} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are real constants and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function is used to transform an initial condition in a spatial eigenfunction problem governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = -Au + iBu \\\\).\n\nGiven the state of the system at \\\\( u(T) \\\\), can we conclusively determine the timings and specifics (\\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( B \\\\), \\\\( A' \\\\), \\\\( B' \\\\)) of the interventions based solely on this observation?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) can result from various combinations and timings of changes in \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) to \\\\( A' \\\\) and \\\\( B' \\\\). Without additional information or constraints, multiple pairs and timing sequences can yield the same observed state at \\\\( T \\\\), making unique identification of intervention specifics impossible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
