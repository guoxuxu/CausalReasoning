  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( u(x, t) \\) governed by the partial differential equation \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = Lu \\), where \\( L \\) is a linear differential operator. Analyze the effect of an integral transformation \\( T \\) defined by \\( T[u](x, t) = \\int K(x, y, t) u(y, t) dy \\), where \\( K \\) is a kernel function.\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), a new transformation \\( S[u] = \\int M(x, y, t) u(y, t) dy \\) (where \\( M \\) is another kernel function) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\( u(x, T) \\) for T > \\( t_1 \\) depend only on \\( L \\) and not on \\( K \\) or \\( M \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention \\( S[u] \\) introduces another layer of transformation, making the final state \\( u(x, T) \\) dependent on \\( K \\), \\( M \\), and \\( L \\). The effects of \\( K \\) and \\( M \\) could be compounded or modulated by each other, influencing the overall system behavior and final outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
