  "Problem": "Explore the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are distinct constant matrices. We assess the results when \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is subjected to the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another constant matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then it evolves by the governing equations without any further transformations, will the state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T = T be the same as it would be by simply evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under the original differential equations?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) due to the transformation \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\), which affects the state differently than if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) were only subject to the natural evolution through \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), hence the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will differ.",
