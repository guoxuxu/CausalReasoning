  "Problem": "Consider a controlled linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx + Bu\\\\), where D is a constant matrix and B is the control input matrix. We explore the impact of an integral transformation of the states defined by the operator \\\\( T(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Mt}x(t) dt \\\\), where M is another constant matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T(x) \\\\) is applied to a state vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and no control inputs are applied thereafter (i.e., \\\\( u(t) = 0 \\\\)), will \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be solely influenced by D with the initial state modified by \\\\( T(x_0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(x) \\\\) which involves integration modified by \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\) will change how the state evolves over time relative to just being influenced by D alone. The effects of M on the trajectory through the transformation integral need to be considered in addition to D.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The integral transformation T(x_0) of the initial state x_0 at t=0, through the action of matrix M, influences x(t) at any time t. The dynamics of x(t) are then governed by matrix D, starting from this transformed initial state."
