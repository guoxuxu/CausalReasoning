  "Problem": "Analyze the relationship between a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\omega z + \\gamma \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We consider transformations of the form \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z + \\\\beta \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) are constants.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\delta t}z + \\\\theta \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) are constants) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be solely dependent on the original parameters (\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the intervention by \\\\( g(z) \\\\) adds new elements to the system dynamics making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent not only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) but also influenced by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\). The interactions between these transformations and the original system parameters affect the trajectory and thus the final state.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z(t) depends on ω, γ, α, β, t, and the transformation parameters δ and θ through g(z). Applying g(z) at t1 introduces additional dependencies on δ and θ, making z(T) not solely dependent on ω and γ for T > t1."
