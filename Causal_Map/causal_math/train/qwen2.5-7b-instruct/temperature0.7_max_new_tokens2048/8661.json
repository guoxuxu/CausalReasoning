  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) evolving over time \\( t \\) with \\( \\omega \\) a real constant. An operation \\( \\mathcal{T} \\) transforms \\( z(t) \\) into \\( z'(t) = \\mathcal{T}(z(t)) = z(t) + ce^{dt} \\) where \\( c \\) and \\( d \\) are complex constants.\n\nIf the transformation \\( \\mathcal{T}(z(t)) \\) is applied at time \\( t = 0 \\) and the system evolves naturally, will the behavior of \\( z'(t) \\) at a later time \\( T \\) solely depend on the original function \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation adds a term \\( ce^{dt} \\) which evolves independently of \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\). The overall behavior of \\( z'(t) \\) at time \\( T \\) will depend both on \\( \\omega \\) and the new constants \\( c \\) and \\( d \\), hence not solely on \\( \\omega \\).",
