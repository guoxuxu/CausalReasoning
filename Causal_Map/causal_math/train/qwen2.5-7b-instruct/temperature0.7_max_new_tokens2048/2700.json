  "Problem": "Examine the causality in a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + L(u) = 0\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We are considering the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) on the function \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\).\n\nGiven the state \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\), can we precisely determine the transformations applied (whether \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\), or both), solely based on the knowledge of \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting state \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) could be achieved through various combinations and sequences of applying \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\), due to the overlapping effects and possible equivalence in outcome between different transformation paths.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state u(x, T) directly influences u(x, t) through the evolution described by the partial differential equation. The linear differential operator L(u) also directly influences u(x, t). Applying the Fourier transform F to u(x, T) directly influences u(x, t)."
