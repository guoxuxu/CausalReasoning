  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the Laplace transform of the impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) which is derived as \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - A} \\\\), where A represents a constant. The system is studied under a Heaviside step function input \\\\( u(t) = 1(t) \\\\) converted into the Laplace domain to form \\\\( U(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s} \\\\). The output in the Laplace domain is then \\\\( Y(s) = H(s)U(s) \\\\).\n\nCan we conclusively determine whether the intervention with \\\\( F(s) \\\\) was implemented by observing only the final output \\\\( Y(F) \\\\) at times greater than T?",
  "Explanation": "Without comparative data on output before and after T or explicit knowledge of the intervention, final output \\\\( Y(F) \\\\) alone could potentially result from various combined system changes, not conclusively indicating the intervention with \\\\( F(s) \\\\). Dynamic similarities and overlaps between how K and A affect the system make it ambiguous.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The transfer function H(s) and the input U(s) causally influence the output Y(s) in the Laplace domain. An intervention with F(s) causally influences the output Y(F) in the Laplace domain."
