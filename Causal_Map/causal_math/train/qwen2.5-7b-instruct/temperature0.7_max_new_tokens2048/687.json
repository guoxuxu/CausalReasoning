  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) that evolves over time according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where P is a constant matrix. We analyze the effect of a linear transformation defined by the operator \\\\( L(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) where Q is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf another linear operator \\\\( M(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\) (where R is another constant matrix) is applied at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), for T > t_1, depend only on P and not on Q or R?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( M(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) imposes additional dynamics to the system, influencing the final state based on the matrices Q, R, and P. Both Q and R contribute to altering the trajectory from what would have been influenced solely by P.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of z from t1 to T depends only on P through L(z) and not on Q or R because M(z) does not affect the subsequent evolution governed by P."
