  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) applied to a system characterized by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\), where M is a diagonal matrix. We explore the behavior of the system under the influence of integral transformation \\\\( T(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{M\\\\tau}x(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\).\n\nGiven the state at time T, \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can one ascertain whether \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was applied at t = 0 without additional information about system behavior between t = 0 and T?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about whether \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was applied initially, the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) does not provide sufficient information to retroactively determine the initial condition, especially as the function \\\\( e^{it} \\\\) could yield multiple potential initial states, depending on the matrix M.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function z(t) influences x(T) through the differential equation dynamics, with M determining the evolution of x(T) over time. The integral transformation T(x) further shapes x(T) based on the system's behavior from t=0 to T."
