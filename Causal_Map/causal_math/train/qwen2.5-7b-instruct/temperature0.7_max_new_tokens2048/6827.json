  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. To analyze this scenario, we apply an integral transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\) at different times.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) immediately after applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\), will the endpoint function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolve independently of the original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) used before the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Upon changing \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\), the subsequent evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) strictly depends on the new parameter \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\). This alteration fundamentally changes the trajectory, causing it to follow a path dictated by the new differential equation with \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\), making it independent of the original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",
