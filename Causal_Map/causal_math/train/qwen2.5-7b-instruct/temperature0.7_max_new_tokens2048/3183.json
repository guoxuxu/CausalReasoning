  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\) where D is a dynamically determined matrix. The system is subjected to operators \\( h(x) = Ce^{Ft}x \\) and \\( k(x) = Ke^{Gt}x \\) representing two types of interventions over time t with constant matrices C, F, K, and G.\n\nAssume an intervention with \\( k(x) = Ke^{Gt}x \\) is applied at a later time t_1 (t_1 < T). Does the final state \\( x(T) \\) depend solely on the matrix D and not on F or G?",
  "Explanation": "The later intervention \\( k(x) \\) alters the state again, introducing effects from matrix K and G into the development of the state. Consequently, the final state \\( x(T) \\) is influenced by D, F, and G. Both the initial operation and the intervention have lasting impacts, not just the intrinsic parameter D.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
