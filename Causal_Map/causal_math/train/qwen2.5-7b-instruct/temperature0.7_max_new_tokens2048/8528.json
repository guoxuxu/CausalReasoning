  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = Az(t) \\\\), where A is a complex constant. Investigate the influence of the transformation defined by the mapping \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where B is another complex constant, over time t.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we deterministically ascertain what interventions were applied (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), solely from knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can result from various sequences or combinations of interventions due to the properties of exponential transformations with complex exponents. Multiple intervention scenarios could lead to the same endpoint due to the overlapping effects and the complex nature of A, B, and C.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition z(0) directly influences z(t) through the differential equation, and B directly influences e^(Bt) which in turn affects z(t). The transformation f(z) = e^(Bt)z changes z(t) over time t, leading to z(T). Knowing z(T) does not uniquely determine the sequence of transformations applied."
