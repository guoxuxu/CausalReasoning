  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant real number representing angular frequency. We examine changes when applying a transformation \\\\( g(z) = kz \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant, modifying the amplitude and phase.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(z) = kz \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 = 1 \\\\) at t = 0 and then the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is evaluated with no further transformation, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T > 0 be the same as directly evaluating \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Transforming \\\\( z_0 \\\\) by \\\\( g(z) = kz \\\\) modifies the initial condition, affecting both the magnitude and phase of the resultant complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\). This results in \\\\( z(T) = k e^{i \\omega T} \\\\), which differs from \\\\( e^{i \\omega T} \\\\) unless \\\\( k = 1 \\\\).",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of k changes z(0) which then influences z(t) through the function z(t) = e^(iωt). Since z(0) = 1, applying g(z) = kz modifies z(0) to kz(0) = k, and this change propagates to affect z(t) for t > 0. Therefore, z(T) after applying g(z) is not the same as directly evaluating z(T) without the transformation."
