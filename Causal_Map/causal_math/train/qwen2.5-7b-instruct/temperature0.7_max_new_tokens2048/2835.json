  "Problem": "Analyze the effect of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) applied to a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) with respect to its behavior modeled by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} + p \\\\frac{dy}{dt} + qy = f(t) \\\\), where p and q are constants. The Laplace transform of the differential equation is considered to see the change in the solution's domain from time to frequency.\n\nIf at some time during solving the transformed equation a modification is made (an intervention such as adding a damping factor \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant), will the final solution \\\\( y(t) \\\\) only depend on the original parameters \\\\( p \\\\) and \\\\( q \\\\) of the differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with a damping factor modifies the differential equation in the frequency domain, affecting the inverse-transformed solution in the time domain. This makes the final state \\\\( y(t) \\\\) dependent not merely on the original parameters \\\\( p \\\\) and \\\\( q \\\\), but also significantly on the damping factor introduced, altering the solution's behavior and characteristics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
