  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) and its effect on solutions to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dz} w = kw \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore how the transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) \\\\), and other similar transformations, impact the behavior of solutions over the complex plane.\n\nIf, at some complex point \\\\( z_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{cz} \\\\) (where \\\\( c \\\\) is a different complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( w(z) \\\\) for \\\\( z > z_1 \\\\) depend only on \\\\( k \\\\) and not on \\\\( c \\\\) or the initial modification?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) = e^{cz} \\\\) introduces a new variable factor affecting the solution's trajectory. The final state \\\\( w(z) \\\\) will be dependent not only on \\\\( k \\\\) but also significantly on \\\\( c \\\\) and the original transformation due to the combined effects of the transformations across the complex plane.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
