  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation given by a matrix \\( M \\) in a vector space and its effect on the vector \\( x \\). The transformation is then followed by an integral transformation represented by \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{ x(t) \\} \\), which is the Laplace transform of the vector function \\( x(t) \\).\n\nWill the Laplace transform of \\( Mx(t) \\), denoted as \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{ Mx(t) \\} \\), be equivalent to multiplying \\( M \\) by the Laplace transform of \\( x(t) \\), denoted \\( M \\mathcal{L} \\{ x(t) \\} \\), assuming no additional intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Laplace transform is a linear operation, it commutes with the linear transformation \\( M \\). Therefore, \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{ Mx(t) \\} = M \\mathcal{L} \\{ x(t) \\} \\).",
