  "Problem": "Consider a system driven by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We examine the effects of modifying the system with a transformation represented by \\\\( h(x) = e^{Dt}x \\\\), where D is another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and subsequently evolves according to \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\) without additional intervention, will \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be identical to the scenario where \\\\( x_0 \\\\) is directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(x) = e^{Dt}x \\\\) modifies the initial state vector, which leads to a different trajectory than if the system had evolved from \\\\( x_0 \\\\) under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\) alone. Depending on \\\\( D \\\\) and its relationship with \\\\( M \\\\), the system's trajectory can notably diverge.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation h(x) to x_0 at t=0 and then evolving it according to \\(\\dot{x} = Mx\\) will result in the same x(t) at t=T as directly evolving x_0 to t=T under \\(\\dot{x} = Mx\\), given that both transformations are governed by the same matrix M."
