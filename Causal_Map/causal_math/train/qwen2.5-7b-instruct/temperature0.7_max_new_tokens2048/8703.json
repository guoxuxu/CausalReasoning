  "Problem": "Consider a vibrational system modeled by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} + 2\\\\zeta\\\\omega\\\\dot{x} + \\\\omega^2x = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\zeta \\\\) is the damping ratio and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the natural frequency. We study the effect of a transformation described by \\\\( f(x, \\\\dot{x}) = (e^{At}x, e^{At}\\\\dot{x}) \\\\), where A is a scalar.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(x, \\\\dot{x}) = (e^{Bt}x, e^{Bt}\\\\dot{x}) \\\\) (where B is a scalar) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( (x(T), \\\\dot{x}(T)) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the original system parameters (\\\\( \\\\zeta, \\\\omega \\\\)) and not on A or B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(x, \\\\dot{x}) \\\\) introduces another modification factor, making the final state dependent on A and B in addition to \\\\( \\\\zeta \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). These transformations have a compositional effect that affects the system's trajectory and endpoint due to their exponential nature.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The endpoint (x(T), \\dot{x}(T)) depends on the transformations e^{At} and e^{Bt}, which are influenced by A and B respectively. However, the original system parameters (ζ, ω) determine the behavior of x and \\dot{x} before the transformations are applied."
