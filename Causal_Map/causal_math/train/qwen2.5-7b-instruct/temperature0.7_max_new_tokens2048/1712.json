  "Problem": "Consider a sequence of integral transformations on a function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) defined as \\\\( g(x) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-tx} f(x) dx \\\\), followed by \\\\( h(x) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-sx} g(x) dx \\\\). We examine the effects and causal sequences related to combining and modifying these transformations.\n\nCan we deduce precisely the sequence of transformations and their parameters (t, s, u) applied only from knowledge of the function \\\\( k(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the function \\\\( k(x) \\\\) as an endpoint, it is challenging to reverse-engineer the exact parameters (t, s, u) or the sequence of transformations, given that multiple combinations of these parameters might yield similar or indistinguishable results due to the convolution-like integrations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function f(x) is transformed into g(x) through integration with parameter t, then g(x) is transformed into h(x) through another integration with parameter s. Alternatively, k(x) can be directly transformed into h(x) through an integration with some parameter u."
