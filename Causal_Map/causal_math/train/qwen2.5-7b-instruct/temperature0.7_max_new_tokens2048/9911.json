  "Problem": "Consider the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z\\\\), where \\( \\\\omega \\) is a real constant and \\( z \\) represents a complex function. Investigating the influence of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{at}z \\\\) where \\( a \\) is a real constant.\n\nSuppose at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention \\\\( g(z) = e^{bt}z \\\\) (where \\( b \\) is another constant) is applied, will the resulting state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on \\( \\\\omega \\) and not on \\( a \\) or \\( b \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at \\( t_1 \\) introduces another level of complexity, altering the magnitude of \\( z \\) at that point. The end state \\( z(T) \\) is thus influenced by \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( \\\\omega \\), given how the transformations \\( e^{at} \\) and \\( e^{bt} \\) affect the pathway of the complex function \\( z \\) over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of z with respect to time is determined by ω. The transformation f(z) does not affect the dependency on ω. Applying g(z) at t1 changes the state z(T) but does not eliminate the influence of ω."
