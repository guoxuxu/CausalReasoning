  "Problem": "Consider a two-dimensional system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Du \\\\), where D is the Laplacian operator. Analyze the influence of the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}[u](k) = \\\\int e^{-ikx} u(x, t) dx \\\\), on the system's behavior over time.\n\nGiven that the solution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) is observed, can we definitively identify whether an Inverse Fourier Transform intervention occurred, without ambiguity from possible other interventions?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple intervention sequences (including combinations of transformations like Fourier and its inverse) can lead to the same observed endpoint. The non-uniqueness of the influences from these transformations, particularly when compounded, creates inherent uncertainty in tracing back exactly which interventions occurred.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
