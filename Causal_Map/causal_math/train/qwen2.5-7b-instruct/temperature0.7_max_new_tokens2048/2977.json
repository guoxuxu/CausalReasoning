  "Problem": "Consider a linear system characterized by the differential equations set \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = Ax(t) + b\\\\) where A is a linear operator and b is a constant vector. An integral transformation is defined by \\\\( f(x) = \\\\int_0^T e^{At}x(t) dt \\\\) for a time period T.\n\nIf an initial condition \\\\( x_0 \\\\) is given and the system is evolved without any external interference, will the transformed output \\\\( f(x) \\\\) at the end of time T be the same as directly integrating \\\\( e^{At}x_0 \\\\) over the interval from 0 to T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(x) \\\\) not only depends on the initial condition but also on how the system evolves through the external vector b during the interval. Integrating \\\\( e^{At}x_0 \\\\) alone assumes no influence from b, thus leading to a different result than \\\\( f(x) \\\\), which includes the cumulative effect of b over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state x(t) at time t is influenced by the linear operator A and the initial condition x_0. The transformed output f(x) at time T is determined by the evolution of x(t) over the interval [0, T], which is equivalent to integrating e^(At)x_0 from 0 to T if there is no external interference."
