  "Problem": "Consider a periodic signal described by the function \\\\( v(t) = A \\\\sin(\\\\omega t + \\\\phi) \\\\). The signal undergoes various modifications using a linear operator represented by \\\\( L \\\\) that performs a convolution with a kernel \\\\( h(t) \\\\), specifically designed to alter phase and amplitude.\n\nIf an additional linear operation \\\\( M \\\\) with another kernel \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is applied at a later time t = t_1, does the signal \\\\( u(t) = M[w(t)] \\\\) at t = T depend only on the operation \\\\( L \\\\) and not on \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervened signal \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at time T depends both on the earlier applied \\\\( L \\\\) as well as the later applied \\\\( M \\\\). The effects of the kernels \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\) are both influential, affecting the resultant signal through combined interactions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The signal w(t) is influenced by the operation L[h(t)], and the signal u(t) is influenced by the operation M[g(t)] on w(t). Therefore, u(t) at t = T depends on both L[h(t)] and M[g(t)]."
