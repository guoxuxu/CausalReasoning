  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. Consider an integral transformation defined by \\\\( v(x, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} K(x, y) u(y, t) dy \\\\), where K is a kernel function representing the transformation.\n\nKnowing the outcome \\\\( w(x, T) \\\\), can one specify which transformations (\\\\( v \\\\) or \\\\( w \\\\) or both) were applied during the evolution, based solely on \\\\( w(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The overlap in effects due to the convolution-like operations inherent in the integral transformations with different kernels makes it difficult to pinpoint precisely what transformations were applied. Different combinations of contributions from K and M can lead to the same end result \\\\( w(x, T) \\\\), rendering it ambiguous.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state u(x, t) directly causes v(x, t) through the transformation defined by the kernel K; the initial state u(x, t) directly causes w(x, T) through the evolution governed by the linear partial differential equation; v(x, t) directly causes w(x, T) as w(x, T) is determined by the evolution from u(x, t) via v(x, t)."
