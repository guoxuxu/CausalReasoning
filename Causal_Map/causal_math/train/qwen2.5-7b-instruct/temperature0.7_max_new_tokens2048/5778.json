  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex plane, \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} g(t, z) dt \\\\), where \\\\( g(t, z) \\\\) is a function of both the real variable t and the complex variable z. This transformation maps complex functions into other complex functions using an integral transform influenced by the parameter s.\n\nGiven the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at a set evaluation point, can we determine the exact value of \\\\( s \\\\) used in the transform without additional information about \\\\( g(t, z) \\\\) or initial conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) does not uniquely encode the parameter \\\\( s \\\\), especially without specifics on \\\\( g(t, z) \\\\) or its dependency on \\\\( t \\\\) and \\\\( z \\\\). Multiple values of \\\\( s \\\\) might produce similar or indistinguishable results in \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at a given evaluation point due to properties of the integral and the nature of \\\\( g(t, z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function f(z) depends on the parameter s through the integral transform, and g(t, z) influences f(z) by being integrated with respect to t. Knowing f(z) at a specific point does not uniquely determine s without further details about g(t, z) or initial conditions."
