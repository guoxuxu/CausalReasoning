  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We examine the effects of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u(t, x)) = \\\\hat{u}(t, k)\\\\) and its inverse across variable transformations.\n\nIf the Fourier transform is applied to the function \\\\(u(t, x)\\\\) at t = 0 and evolved under the partial differential equation without further intervention, will the function \\\\(u(t, x)\\\\) at t = T transform identically to if the function had been directly evolved to t = T under the same equation?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transformation and its inverse are linear and invertible operations that preserve the dynamics governed by the linear operator L when no further operations modify the function, thereby maintaining the system integrity throughout the transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Fourier transform at t=0 and then evolving under the PDE is equivalent to directly evolving the function u(t,x) from t=0 to t=T under the same PDE."
