  "Problem": "Assume a linear system of equations represented in matrix form \\\\( Ax = b \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is an invertible matrix. Analyze scenarios applying the Laplace transform to the function \\\\( x(t) = e^{At}x_0 \\\\), with \\\\( x_0 \\\\) being the initial conditions, over the time domain.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform of the state at t = T, can we recover the initial conditions \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without knowing the precise dynamics (i.e., matrix A) beforehand?",
  "Explanation": "Recovering \\\\( x_0 \\\\) purely from the Laplace transform of the state at a specific time T requires knowledge of matrix A, as the inverse Laplace transform needed to retrieve \\\\( x_0 \\\\) is dependent on correctly formulating \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) which in turn relies on A.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state x(t) transforms to its Laplace domain representation X(s), the matrix A determines the state x(t) over time, the initial conditions x_0 influence x(t), and the Laplace transform X(s) contains information about x_0 but requires knowledge of A to fully recover it."
