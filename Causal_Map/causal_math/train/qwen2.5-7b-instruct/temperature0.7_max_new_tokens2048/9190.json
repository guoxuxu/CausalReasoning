  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions describing a physical system's states. The Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) is used for analysis.\n\nObserving the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at a particular value s = s_0, can we uniquely determine the initial condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\) affects the shape of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) but given \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) alone without additional boundary or auxiliary conditions, there are typically multiple possible initial conditions that could result in the same transform at \\\\( s_0 \\\\).",
