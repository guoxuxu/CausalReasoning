  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\) where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant. Let's examine the system's behavior under the Fourier Transform \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\} \\) and perform perturbations using multiplication by another function \\( h(t) = e^{-\\alpha t} \\), where \\( \\alpha \\) is a positive real constant.\n\nIf after applying the Fourier Transform to \\( z(t) \\), \\( h(t) \\) is multiplied at a time \\( t_1 \\), does this alter the final frequency spectrum to include frequencies other than \\( \\omega \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying by \\( h(t) = e^{-\\alpha t} \\) post transformation affects the frequency spectrum. The multiplication corresponds to a convolution in the frequency domain with \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{h(t)\\} \\), broadening the original delta function and introducing components at frequencies other than \\( \\omega \\), centered around \\( \\omega \\) but with a decay rate governed by \\( \\alpha \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The time at which perturbation occurs (t_1) influences the function h(t), which in turn modifies z(t). The modified z(t) then affects its Fourier Transform F{z(t)}, potentially altering the frequency spectrum beyond just ω."
