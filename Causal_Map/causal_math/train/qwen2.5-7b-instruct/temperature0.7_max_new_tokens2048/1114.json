  "Problem": "Analyze a signal processing system where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed by a Fourier transform, subjected to a filter \\\\( H(s) \\\\), and then converted back using the inverse Fourier transform. Let's denote the output signal as \\\\( y(t) = \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}(H(s) \\\\mathcal{F}(x(t))) \\\\).\n\nGiven the output signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\), can we infer the exact form of the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without knowing the specifics of the filter \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the characteristics of the filter \\\\( H(s) \\\\), multiple different input signals could potentially produce the same output due to the modifications imposed by the unknown filter in the frequency domain. The problem lacks a unique inversion unless additional information about \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is provided.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input signal x(t) is transformed by the Fourier transform to produce Fourier(x(t)), which is then filtered by H(s) to produce y(t). The inverse Fourier transform of the product of H(s) and Fourier(x(t)) results in y(t)."
