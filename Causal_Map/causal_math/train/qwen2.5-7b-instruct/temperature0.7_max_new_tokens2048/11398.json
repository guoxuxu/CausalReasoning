  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by a linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) where C is a constant matrix. We investigate the implications of imposing the transformation \\\\( g(z) = Dz \\\\) at time t, where D is also a constant matrix, and analyzing the system's evolution.\n\nFrom the knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, is it possible to deduce the initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 accurately without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The initial state could have been either \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or \\\\( Dz_0 \\\\) due to the transformation \\\\( g(z) = Dz \\\\). Without explicit knowledge about the application of \\\\( D \\\\), compounded by its possible non-commutativity with \\\\( C \\\\), tracing back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) accurately is indeterminate.",
