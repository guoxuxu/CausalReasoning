  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\(w(z) = e^{z^2}\\\\), where \\\\(z\\\\) is a complex number. The system is then studied under the transformation, \\\\( g(w) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}w(t) dt \\\\), an integral transform with parameter \\\\(s\\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed output \\\\(g(w\\\\)) at \\\\(s = s_0\\\\), can we uniquely determine the original \\\\(z_0\\\\) without knowing its prior application?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation output under \\\\(g(w)\\\\) at a specific \\\\(s\\\\) value is the result of an integral over the entire evolution of the function, which obscures the specific influence of the original \\\\(z_0\\\\). Multiple different \\\\(z\\\\) values might yield the same or indistinguishable effects under the transformation \\\\(g\\\\), especially given the complex squaring and exponential operations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
