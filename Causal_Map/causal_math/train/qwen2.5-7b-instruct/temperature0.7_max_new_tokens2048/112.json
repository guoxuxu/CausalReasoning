  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) governed by a differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency. The system is subjected to the transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z\\\\), with \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) being a complex constant.\n\nBased on the system's state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at time T, is it possible to uniquely determine which transformations were applied (whether \\\\(h(z)\\\\), \\\\(j(z)\\\\), or both), knowing only \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final observed state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) could potentially be achieved through various combinations of the parameters \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\), \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\), and the differential equation constant \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\). The effects induced by these transformations and the intrinsic system dynamics (characterized by \\\\(i\\\\omega\\\\)) intermingle in a way that makes it impossible to disentangle and uniquely identify the interventions solely based on the endpoint observation.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The constant frequency ω determines the rate of change of z with respect to time (ω → dz/dt), the complex constant α transforms z through the function h(z) (α → h(z)), and the time T determines the state of z (T → z(T))."
