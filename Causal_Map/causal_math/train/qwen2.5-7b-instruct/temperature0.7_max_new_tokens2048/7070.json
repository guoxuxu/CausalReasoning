  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit governed by the differential equation \\( \\frac{d^2 q}{dt^2} + R\\frac{dq}{dt} + \\frac{1}{L}q = 0 \\), where \\( q(t) \\) is the charge, \\( R \\) is the resistance, and \\( L \\) is the inductance. Let's analyze the effect of introducing a sinusoidal voltage source \\( V(t) = V_0 \\sin(\\omega t) \\) and its impact on the steady-state solution of the system.\n\nAfter observing the total charge \\( q(t) \\) at time T, can we deduce the resistance \\( R \\) directly without knowing the specifics of the voltage source \\( V(t) \\) used?",
  "Explanation": "The observed charge \\( q(t) \\) at time T is influenced by the voltage source characteristics as well as the circuit properties. Without explicit knowledge of the voltage source \\( V(t) \\), it cannot be conclusively determined whether variations in observed charge are due to changes in resistance \\( R \\) or due to different settings of \\( V_0 \\) or \\( \\omega \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "A sinusoidal voltage source influences the charge in the circuit, while resistance affects the second derivative of the charge and inductance affects the first derivative of the charge."
