  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\), representing a rotating vector in the complex plane with angular frequency \\\\( w \\\\). The effect of an external transformation is considered using the operator \\\\( L \\\\) where \\\\( L(z) = e^{at}z \\\\) with \\\\( a \\\\) being a constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( L(z) \\\\) is applied at t = 0 to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then it evolves according to \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}z_0 \\\\) without further intervention, will the resulting \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was simply evolved to T under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( L(z) \\\\) introduces a modification to the initial condition, scaling it by \\\\( e^{aT} \\\\) and potentially changing the magnitude and phase of the complex vector. As such, the state at time T will differ due to this initial scaling effect.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation L at t=0 to z_0 results in z(0), which then evolves to z(T) under z(t) = e^(iwt)z(0). Directly evolving z_0 under z(t) = e^(iwt)z_0 also leads to z(T). Therefore, z(T) will be the same in both cases."
