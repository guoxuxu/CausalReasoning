  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(t) \\) in the complex plane defined by the equation \\( z'(t) = iAz(t) \\), where \\( A \\) is a real constant. We explore the effect of an integral transform \\( z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{iBs}z(s) ds \\), where \\( B \\) is another real constant.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\( \\hat{z}(t) = \\int_0^t e^{iCs}z(s) ds \\) (where \\( C \\) is a real constant) is applied at \\( t = t_1 \\), will the state at \\( t = T > t_1 \\) be solely dependent on \\( A \\) and not on \\( B \\) or \\( C \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with a second integral transformation introduces additional dynamics into the system, making \\( \\hat{z}(T) \\) dependent on \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\). The diversity in transformation constants and their cumulative effects profoundly influence the trajectory, reflecting in the differences at \\( t = T \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "A directly influences z(t) through z'(t); B and C indirectly influence z(t) via the integral transforms, but their effects are overridden by A after the transformation at t=t_1."
