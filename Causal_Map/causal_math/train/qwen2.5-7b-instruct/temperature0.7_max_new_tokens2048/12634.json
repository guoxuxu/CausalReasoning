  "Problem": "We consider the effects of the Laplace Transform on a differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix, and study how this affects the system's response. We implement the transform \\\\(g(z) = \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s)\\\\) and analyze its impact on the solution over the complex variable s.\n\nIf at a specific time t1, an intervention by applying another transformation, say \\\\(h(z) = z^2\\\\) is done, will the solution in the s-domain at any later time only depend on D and not on the initial application of the Laplace Transform?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(h(z) = z^2\\\\) introduces a nonlinear transformation into the system, affecting the evolving state alongside the linear transformation due to D. Consequently, the final state in the s-domain will be dependent on the initial Laplace transform as well as the nonlinear dynamics introduced by the intervention, influencing the entire evolution.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The diagonalizability of D directly influences the behavior of z, which then determines g(z) through the Laplace transform, leading to a solution in the s-domain. An additional transformation h(z) → z^2 does not affect the dependency of the s-domain solution solely on D."
