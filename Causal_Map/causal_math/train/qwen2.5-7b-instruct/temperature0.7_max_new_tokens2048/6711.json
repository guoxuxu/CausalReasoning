  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We explore the effect of a transformation given by \\\\( g(u) = (Tf)(u) \\\\), where \\\\( Tf \\\\) represents a Fourier transform over a function f modifying u.\n\nIf an intervention by applying another transformation \\\\( h(u) = (Tg)(u) \\\\), where \\\\( Tg \\\\) is another integral transformation, is executed at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state of the system at \\\\( t = T \\\\), for T > t_1, depend solely on the original operator L?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( h(u) \\\\) as an intervention adds another layer of transformation, altering the state's path further via effects on its Fourier or other transform properties. This means the end state at \\\\( t = T \\\\) depends not only on L but also on the effects of \\\\( Tg \\\\) and \\\\( Tf \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying transformations g and h modifies u, which influences its evolution according to the operator L. Therefore, the final state at t = T depends on both L and the transformations g and h applied."
