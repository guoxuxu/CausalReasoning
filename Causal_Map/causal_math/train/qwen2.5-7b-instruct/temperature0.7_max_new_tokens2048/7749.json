  "Problem": "Examine the causal effects in a system governed by a Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = F(s) \\\\) of a function f(t), focusing on the response of systems described by the transfer function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s + a} \\\\) where a is a constant.\n\nIf an input function \\\\( f(t) = e^{-bt} \\\\) is applied to the system without any further intervention, will the output at time \\\\( t \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( f(t) \\\\) was directly used in any other systems with different values of \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output will depend on the parameter \\\\( a \\\\) in the transfer function, specifically, \\\\( Y(s) = H(s) F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+a} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{s+b} \\\\) results in differing outputs for distinct values of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\). The system's specific dynamics due to \\\\( a \\\\) influence the transformation of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) under the Laplace domain and thereby the time domain output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input function f(t) transforms to F(s) through the Laplace transform; the transfer function H(s) determines the output G(s) in the s-domain, which then inverse-transforms to g(t); different values of a in H(s) lead to different G(s) and g(t)."
