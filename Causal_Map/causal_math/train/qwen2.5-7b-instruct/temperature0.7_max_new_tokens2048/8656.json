  "Problem": "Consider an electrical RLC circuit with resistors, capacitors, and inductors described by the differential equation \\\\(V(t) = L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI + \\\\frac{1}{C} \\\\int I dt\\\\), where L is the inductance, R is the resistance, C is the capacitance, I is the current, and V(t) is the input voltage at time t.\n\nGiven the final current waveform \\\\(I(T)\\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were applied (changes in L, C, or both) only based on the waveform at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting current waveform may be generic enough that different combinations of L and C values (representing different interventions) can produce similar current responses. Without additional information, it is impossible to uniquely pinpoint which specific changes were made to L and C based solely on the observed response.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
