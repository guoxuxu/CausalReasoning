  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z = f(x, y)\\\\) defined on the complex plane, where \\\\(f(x, y) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y)\\\\) and \\\\(u\\\\) and \\\\(v\\\\) are harmonic functions. The transformation considered here is the complex exponential transformation \\\\(g(z) = e^z\\\\).\n\nSuppose an intervention is made at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) where another complex function \\\\(h(z) = e^{bz}\\\\) is applied, does the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on a and not on b?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention with \\\\(h(z) = e^{bz}\\\\) significantly alters the development path of the system post-intervention. Both parameters a and b will influence the future trajectory and endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\), due to the compound effects of the transformations and the evolution under the dynamical system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
