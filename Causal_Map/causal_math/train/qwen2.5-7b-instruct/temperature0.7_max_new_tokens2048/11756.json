  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) satisfy the harmonic oscillator equations \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} = -\\\\omega^2 x\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\ddot{y} = -\\\\omega^2 y\\\\), with \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) being a constant. We explore how the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), which transforms a function into its frequency components, affects the inference capabilities within the system dynamics.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t)) \\\\) is computed at t = 0 and then the inverse Fourier transform is applied, resulting in \\\\( z'(t) \\\\), will \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) at any t be identical to \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) and its inverse form a perfect reconstruction pair for functions satisfying certain conditions, which includes the oscillatory functions described by the system. Hence, the initial state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) can be fully recovered leading to an identical function over time.",
