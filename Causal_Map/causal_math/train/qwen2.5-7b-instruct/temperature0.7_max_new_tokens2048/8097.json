  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system characterized by the differential equation \\\\( i\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Cz \\\\), where C is a constant complex matrix. We explore the effects of the transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), where D is also a constant complex matrix, on the system over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( i\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Cz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( i\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Cz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( e^{Dt}z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, creating a different trajectory due to the interaction of the matrices D and C. Even if C and D commute, the exponential of the sum is not necessarily the sum of exponentials which affects the state at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation h(z) and the initial condition z_0 directly influence z(t), while the constant complex matrix C determines how z(t) evolves over time, and the matrix D affects z(t) through the transformation applied before evolution under i dz/dt = Cz."
