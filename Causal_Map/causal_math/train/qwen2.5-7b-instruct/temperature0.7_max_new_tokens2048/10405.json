  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant. To analyze the behavior, we intervene by applying a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}\\\\cdot z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is also a constant, at a certain time.\n\nIf an initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is transformed at t = 0 using \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\), and then the system is allowed to evolve according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) till time T without further intervention, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved under the original dynamics without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "By modifying the initial condition via the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\), the trajectory is altered since the phase of the complex number has been shifted by \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\). The resultant trajectory follows a different path even though the dynamics governing the magnitude remain consistent.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation f(z) = e^(iθ)z to z_0 at t=0 results in a new z which, when evolved according to the dynamics dz/dt = iωz until time T, leads to z(T), which is equivalent to directly evolving z_0 under the same dynamics until T."
