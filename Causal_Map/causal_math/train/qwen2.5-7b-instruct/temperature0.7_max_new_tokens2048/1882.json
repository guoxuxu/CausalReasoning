  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the time-dependent differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Ay \\\\), where A is a constant matrix. We are interested in testing the effects of applying a complex integral transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Bt}z(t) dt \\\\), where B is also a constant matrix, on this system.\n\nGiven observations of \\\\( z(T') \\\\) at some T' > T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, can we infer the initial state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) accurately?",
  "Explanation": "Without certainty about the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it is impossible to accurately reverse-engineer the initial condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\). The potential application of the transformation obscures direct insight into \\\\( z(0) \\\\) due to the compounded effect of both the matrix exponential and the integral operation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial states x(0) and y(0) determine z(0), which evolves over time according to A; B affects the integral transformation f(z); z(t) evolves to z(T) over time; observing z(T') provides information about the state of the system at T'."
