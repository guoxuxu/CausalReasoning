  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} + i\\\\omega z = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number. We explore the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(z(t))dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nIf an intervention is applied at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), where a new function modification \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is multiplied by a constant factor \\\\( C \\\\), will the outcome of \\\\( T[f](z(T)) \\\\) be influenced solely by the modified function at \\\\( t_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) modifies the trajectory \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from that point onward, affecting the integral transform outcome. This change not only impacts the resultant function but also shifts the part of the integration graph post-\\\\( t_1 \\\\), hence the whole transformation \\\\( T[f](z) \\\\) is affected by both pre and post-intervention behaviors.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
