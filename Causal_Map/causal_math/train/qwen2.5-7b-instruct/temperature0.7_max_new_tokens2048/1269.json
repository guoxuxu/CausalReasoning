  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) defined as the solution to the complex differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz + k\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a complex constant. We are investigating scenarios where an integral transformation \\\\(w(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sA} z(s) ds\\\\) is applied, with \\\\(A\\\\) being a constant matrix.\n\nIf the complex function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) evolves naturally according to its differential equation with initial condition \\\\(z(0) = z_0\\\\), will the transformed function \\\\(w(T)\\\\) at time T necessarily reflect the direct effect of the differential equation on \\\\(z(t)\\\\) without considering the impact of matrix \\\\(A\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation involves the matrix exponent \\\\(e^{sA}\\\\), which modifies the impact of \\\\(z(s)\\\\) during integration. This additional factor means that \\\\(w(T)\\\\) does not simply reflect the evolution of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) under the differential equation; it is also shaped by the influence of \\\\(A\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of z(t) according to its differential equation directly influences w(T), and the rate of change of z(t) also directly influences w(T) through the integral transformation."
