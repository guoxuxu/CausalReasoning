  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We analyse the effect of the integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Nt}z \\\\, dt \\\\), where N is also a constant matrix.\n\nCan the original complex function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be accurately deduced after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T, without knowing if \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information regarding the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and considering the effect of the integral transformation that modifies initial conditions in a comprehensive way, it is impossible to uniquely trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\), especially since multiple potential initial states could result in the same observed endpoint due to the integration and transformation by \\\\( e^{Nt} \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
