  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{Lt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a complex matrix and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex vector. This scenario examines the impacts of a linear transformation \\\\( h(z) = Pz \\\\), with \\\\( P \\\\) being another constant complex matrix, on the system's evolution over time.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = e^{Lt}z \\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was evolved to t = T under \\\\( z(t) = e^{Lt}z \\\\) without the transformation by \\\\( P \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( h(z) = Pz \\\\) at the initial time modifies the starting vector. The evolution of the system is then based on the transformed initial condition \\\\( Pz_0 \\\\), leading to a different trajectory and consequently a different state at time T compared to if no transformation had been applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the linear transformation P to the initial vector z_0 results in a new vector z which then evolves over time according to z(t) = e^(Lt)z, while the original vector z_0 evolves independently to z(t) = e^(Lt)z_0. The state z(t) at time T after applying P to z_0 and then evolving it is compared to the state z(t) at time T after evolving z_0 directly."
