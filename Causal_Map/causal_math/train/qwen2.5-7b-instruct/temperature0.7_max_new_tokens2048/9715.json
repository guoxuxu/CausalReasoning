  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), with \\\\( i = \\\\sqrt{-1} \\\\), \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) a real constant, and \\\\( k \\\\) a fixed complex constant. We analyze the effect of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a real constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) introduces another scaling factor that significantly affects the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Both \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{\\\\beta t} \\\\) contribute to transforming the original dynamics of the equation, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z at time T depends on ω through the differential equation, while the values of α and β affect z only up to time t1 and do not influence z(T) beyond that point."
