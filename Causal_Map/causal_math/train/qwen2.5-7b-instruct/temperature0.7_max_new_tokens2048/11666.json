  "Problem": "Consider a heat distribution on a metal rod described by the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) represents the temperature at point x and time t, and k is the thermal diffusivity. Assess the effect of a heat source represented by a function \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\) added at specific points over time.\n\nGiven the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) at time T, can we uniquely determine the initial temperature distribution or the specifics of the applied heat source \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\) at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The final temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) results from both the initial temperature distribution and the influence of the heat source over time. Since these effects are superimposed in a complex manner governed by the PDE, inferring the cause (initial conditions or specifics of \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\)) from the effect (\\(u(x, T)\\)) is ambiguous without additional information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
