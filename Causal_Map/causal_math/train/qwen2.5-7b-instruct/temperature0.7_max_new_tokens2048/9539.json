  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature (T) at any spatial point (x,y) in a region follows the heat equation given by \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\alpha \\\\nabla^2 T\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. We study the effects of applying a Fourier transform on the temperature distribution, denoted as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(T)\\\\), and analyze its influence over time.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\(\\\\mathcal{G}(T) = \\\\mathcal{F}(T) \\\\cdot e^{-\\\\beta t}\\\\) (where \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) is a damping factor) is applied as an intervention, will the final temperature distribution at time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) evolve independently of the initial Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(\\\\mathcal{G}(T)\\\\) introduces a damping effect that modifies the frequency components, making the final state at \\\\( t = T \\\\) dependent on both the initial application of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(T)\\\\) and the subsequent modification by \\\\( e^{-\\\\beta t} \\\\). The overall impact of these transformations directly influences the system’s evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Temperature T changes over time due to thermal diffusivity α, which affects the spatial second derivatives of T. Applying Fourier transform G(T) at time t1 modifies T according to the damping factor β, influencing the evolution of T over time."
