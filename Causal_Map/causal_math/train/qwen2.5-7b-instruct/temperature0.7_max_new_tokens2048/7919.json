  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) satisfy the coupled differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = ax - by\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = bx + ay\\\\), respectively, with constants a and b. Analyze the behavior of the function after applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\theta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is another constant) is applied as an intervention at any time t_1, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be affected only by the constants a and b but not by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces an additional phase rotation, thereby depending also on \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) as well as \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Since these transformations influence the magnitude and phase of \\\\( z \\\\) throughout its evolution, the final state at t = T is not solely dependent on the original system constants a and b.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The constants a and b directly cause the behavior of x(t) and y(t), which in turn directly cause the behavior of z(t). The transformation f(z) directly causes the behavior of z(t) under the influence of ω. The intervention g(z) at time t_1 directly causes the behavior of z(T) for T > t_1, with the effect being influenced by θ but not ω."
