  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We examine the impact of an integral transformation defined by the Laplace transform on this function over time domain t.\n\nIf after applying the Laplace transform, an additional shifting operation in the s-domain is performed by substituting \\\\( s \\\\) with \\\\( s-a \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real number, will the poles of the transformed function still solely depend on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The shifting operation modifies the location of the poles in the s-domain by \\\\( a \\\\). Therefore, the poles of the resulting function are at \\\\( s = a + i\\\\omega \\\\), indicating dependence on both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( a \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
