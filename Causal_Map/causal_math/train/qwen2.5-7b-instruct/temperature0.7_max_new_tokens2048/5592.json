  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = Xe^{At} \\\\) defining a complex dynamical system, where X is a complex matrix and A is a constant matrix. We are investigating how the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = Z(s) \\\\) affects the system behavior over the variable s.\n\nGiven the observed transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) after known interventions altering A multiple times during the time interval, is it possible to precisely determine all instances and magnitudes of interventions on A?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the precise nature of each intervention on A simply from \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) would be highly complex or impossible, as the transform could feasibly result from different sequences of interventions, particularly without exact knowledge of when each alteration occurred and the specifics of matrix interactions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
