  "Problem": "We consider a dual-space system where two functions are defined: \\\\( f(x) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} x(t) \\, dt \\\\) (Laplace Transform) and \\\\( g(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-2\\pi i t x} \\, dt \\\\) (Fourier Transform). Let \\\\( x(t) \\\\) represent an input signal evolving over time.\n\nIf \\\\( f(x) \\\\) (Laplace transform) is computed and no other transformations are applied, does the resulting transformation define the entire original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) uniquely for all cases?",
  "Explanation": "While the Laplace transform is quite powerful in recovering general signals, certain conditions, such as lack of convergence or presence of non-unique Laplace pairs, prevent it from uniquely defining the original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) in every case.",
