  "Problem": "Consider a system subject to the Laplace Transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) represents a time-dependent state of the system. The impact of convolution with another function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) expressed as \\\\( h(t) = (f*g)(t) \\\\) is analyzed.\n\nIf \\\\( h(t) = (f*g)(t) \\\\) is the current state of the system, and it is allowed to evolve under the original rules without further intervention, will \\\\( L[h(t)] \\\\) at some later time T still incorporate the effects of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) in its representation?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution \\\\( h(t) = (f*g)(t) \\\\) fundamentally alters the system's state. The Laplace Transform \\\\( L[h(t)] = F(s)G(s) \\\\) incorporates the influence of \\\\( g(t) \\\\), and this combined effect persists in the transform domain without degradation over time unless intervened.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The effect of g(t) on h(t) is preserved in L[h(t)], meaning that the Laplace transform of h(t) at any time T still incorporates the influence of g(t) due to the properties of the Laplace transform and convolution."
