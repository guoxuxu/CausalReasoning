  "Problem": "Assume a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(u_t + Au_x = 0\\\\), where A is a constant matrix. Analyze the impact of the transformation defined by the operator \\\\(T(u) = e^{-Bx}u\\\\) across the spatial domain x, where B is another constant matrix.\n\nIf the operator \\\\(T(u)\\\\) is applied to a function \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) initially and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(u_t + Au_x = 0\\\\) without any further intervention, will the function \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) was directly evolved to time T under \\\\(u_t + Au_x = 0\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\(T(u) = e^{-Bx}u\\\\) modifies the initial conditions. The scalar multiplication by \\\\(e^{-Bx}\\\\) alters the characteristic lines of the equation depending on how B relates to A, potentially changing the solution at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation T(u) = e^{-Bx}u applied to the initial function u_0(x) changes the function before it evolves according to the PDE u_t + Au_x = 0, resulting in u(x,T). Directly evolving u_0(x) to time T under the PDE results in another function u(x,T). Without further intervention, the function obtained through T(u) followed by PDE evolution is not necessarily the same as the function obtained by directly evolving u_0(x) under the PDE."
