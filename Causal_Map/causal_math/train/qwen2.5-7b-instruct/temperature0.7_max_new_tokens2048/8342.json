  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( z = w^2 \\\\) in the complex plane, and its transformation by a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z\\\\}(\\\\omega) \\\\). We explore how manipulating the function and its transform affects causal relationships within these systems.\n\nGiven the transformed system \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z\\\\}(\\\\omega) \\\\), can we deduce the exact original function \\\\( w \\\\) from \\\\( z = w^2 \\\\) without further information?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the squared function introduces ambiguity between positive and negative roots, hence \\\\( w \\\\) or \\\\( -w \\\\) could have led to the same \\\\( z \\\\). Without additional information, the recovery of \\\\( w \\\\) solely from \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z\\\\}(\\\\omega) \\\\) is not unique.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of w squared directly causes the value of z, and the value of z directly causes the Fourier transform of z with respect to ω."
