  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on complex plane \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a constant complex matrix. The Laplace transform of the function \\\\( g(t) = e^{Bt} \\\\) is applied to f, where B is also a constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original matrix A, after observing the transformed function over several points in the complex plane, if one is unaware whether the Laplace transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the Laplace transform application, we lack complete information on how the observed output was derived. The transformation by B could significantly adjust the manifestations of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), misleading any inferences drawn directly back to A.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of the original matrix A determines the form of the function f(z), which when transformed using the Laplace transform with matrix B results in the transformed_function. Observing the transformed_function does not allow deducing A without knowing B, as multiple values of A could lead to the same transformed_function given a specific B."
