  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The function is transformed using \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant, to analyze its behavior over time.\n\nIf a new function \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a real constant) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T > \\\\( t_1 \\\\) depend only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the trajectory by further scaling the amplitude of \\\\( z \\\\) from time \\\\( t_1 \\\\). As a result, the final trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) depends on both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) (affecting the phase) and the combined effects of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) on the magnitude, not just solely on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
