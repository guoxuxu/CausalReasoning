  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( x \\\\), with \\\\( A \\\\) being a real number representing a rotational frequency in the complex plane. The behavior over time is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\). We explore the impact of the transformation function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\) where \\\\( B \\\\) is another real number.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to the initial point \\\\( x \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system evolves under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time t = T be equivalent to the direct evolution of \\\\( x \\\\) to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\\\( f(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\) changes the starting point in the complex plane. This modification means the trajectory under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\) starts from a different point, leading to a state at time T that differs from the evolution from \\\\( x \\\\) directly.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of A and B determines the evolution of z over time t. The initial state x, influenced by A through the differential equation \\(\\dot{z} = iAz\\), and the transformation f(z) influenced by B, both contribute to the state z at time t."
