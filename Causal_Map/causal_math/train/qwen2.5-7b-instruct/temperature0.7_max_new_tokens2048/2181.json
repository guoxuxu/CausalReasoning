  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a linear partial differential equation (PDE) given by \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = -\\\\lambda u\\\\) with a boundary condition u(0) = 0. Analyze its behavior under the transformation \\\\( v(x, t) = u(x) e^{-\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( v(x, t) = u(x) e^{-\\\\omega t} \\\\) is applied at t = 0 and the system is then allowed to evolve without further external intervention, will \\\\( v(x, t) \\\\) at t = T satisfy the original PDE?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation applies an exponentially decaying factor in time, which modifies the original time-independent PDE. The factor \\\\( e^{-\\\\omega t} \\\\) introduces a term when differentiated that is not present in the original equation, thus altering the governed behavior of the PDE.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function u(x) transforms into v(x, t) through multiplication by \\(e^{-\\\\omega t}\\); time t influences v(x, t); the Laplacian operator ∇² applied to u(x) results in -λu(x); this expression equals zero; the constant ω scales the exponential term."
