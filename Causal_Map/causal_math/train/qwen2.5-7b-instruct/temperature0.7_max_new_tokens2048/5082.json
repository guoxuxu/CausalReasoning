  "Problem": "Consider a series of kinematic equations \\\\(\\\\vec{x}(t) = \\\\vec{x}_0 + \\\\vec{v}_0t + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\vec{a}t^2\\\\) in a physics simulation space, where \\\\(\\\\vec{a}\\\\) is the acceleration vector. Analyze how applying a transformation matrix \\\\( M \\\\) that scales and rotates the initial velocity \\\\(\\\\vec{v}_0\\\\) affects the position vector \\\\(\\\\vec{x}(t)\\\\) over time.\n\nCan we deduce the original velocity vector \\\\(\\\\vec{v}_0\\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\(\\\\vec{x}(t)\\\\) at t = T without knowing whether the transformation matrix \\\\( M \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the specific knowledge of the application of the transformation matrix \\\\( M \\\\), it is not possible to trace back to the original velocity \\\\(\\\\vec{v}_0\\\\) accurately. The transformation could alter the velocity in various ways, impacting the displacement observed and thus concealing the original conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation matrix M to the initial velocity v_0 before using it in the kinematic equation influences the position vector x(t) over time. The initial velocity v_0 directly causes the position vector x(t), and acceleration a also directly causes the position vector x(t)."
