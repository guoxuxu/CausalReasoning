  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing a periodic signal in the complex plane. We explore the consequences of applying the Fourier transform \\\\( F \\), which converts it into its frequency domain representation.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( F \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without altering \\\\( \\omega \\\\), will the primary frequency component of the transform at \\\\( \\omega \\\\) remain unchanged?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of a complex exponential function like \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) naturally highlights its frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\), showing a Dirac delta function at this frequency. Without changes in \\\\( \\omega \\\\) or additional interventions, this characteristic is preserved.",

List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Fourier transform F to z(t) does not change the primary frequency component at ω, as ω directly determines the frequency of z(t) and the Fourier transform preserves this frequency information."
