  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by a differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. An external operator applies a transformation \\\\( h(x) = Qx \\\\) at time t, with Q also being a constant matrix, and we analyze its impact over various conditions.\n\nHaving observed the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we determine whether the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied at t = 0, assuming no further information about initial conditions or intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Without initial data on \\\\( x_0 \\\\) or specifics about the matrix Q, one cannot confidently back-calculate to determine the presence of the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\). Different initial vectors and different choices of Q could produce the same observed outcome under the evolution governed by \\\\( M \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation h(x) directly influences the state x(t) at any given time t, and the initial state x(0) also directly influences the state x(t) at any given time t."
