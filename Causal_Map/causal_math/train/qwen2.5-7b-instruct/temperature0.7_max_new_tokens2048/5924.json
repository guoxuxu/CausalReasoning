  "Problem": "Analyze the causal relationship in a model where a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), representing periodic motion in the complex plane, modifies a dynamical system described by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\), with D being a diagonalizable matrix. Consider the effects of transforming the state by applying the function \\\\( h(z, x) = z(t) \\\\cdot x \\\\) at an initial time 't'.\n\nGiven only the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) and knowledge that some interventions were used, can we determine precisely which transformations were applied (whether \\\\( h(z, x) \\\\), \\\\( j(z, x) \\\\), or both), by observing just \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Different combinations of the initial transformation and subsequent intervention could produce equivalent endpoints due to the properties of complex multiplication (e.g., different angles yielding the same final complex plane position). Without additional details, such as exact knowledge of the interventions' parameters \\\\( \\\\omega \\ and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\), the specific transformations cannot be backtracked from \\\\( x(T) \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The complex function z(t) influences the state x(t) over time, the dynamics described by D also influence x(t), and the transformation h(z, x) applied at an initial time t results in the state x(T) at a later time T."
