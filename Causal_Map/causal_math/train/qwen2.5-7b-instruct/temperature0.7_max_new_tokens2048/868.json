  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where the state of a system \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), with \\( A \\) being a complex matrix. We inquire about the effects of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) which modifies the system's frequency components.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine whether both Fourier and inverse Fourier transforms were applied or neither based only on \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the nature of Fourier transforms affecting frequency domains and potential phase alterations, multiple transformation sequences could yield the same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\). These transformations may not necessarily be uniquely deducible from the final state due to the complexities introduced by the inherent properties of Fourier-related operations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
