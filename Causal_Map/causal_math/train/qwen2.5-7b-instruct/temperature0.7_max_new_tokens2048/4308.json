  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant real number, representing angular frequency. We analyze the system under a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z)(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i \\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nGiven a frequency-domain representation obtained using the Fourier transform, can we determine precisely if any phase shifts or similar operations were applied during its transition from the time-domain, just by analyzing \\\\( F(z)(\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The spectrum obtained from the Fourier transform provides magnitude and phase information at each frequency, but distinguishing whether the observed phases are due to inherent properties of the original signal or a result of interventions like phase shifts may be indeterminate without additional information. Multiple different time-domain modifications can result in the same or indistinguishably similar frequency-domain representations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The time-domain function z(t) transforms into F(z)(ω) via the Fourier transform, and the constant ω influences the form of F(z)(ω) by determining the angular frequency in the frequency domain."
