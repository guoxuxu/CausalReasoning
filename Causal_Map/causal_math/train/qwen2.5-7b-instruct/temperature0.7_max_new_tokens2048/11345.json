  "Problem": "Consider a two-dimensional system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{u} = M u\\\\), where M is a matrix giving the linear transformation on vector \\\\(u\\\\). We investigate the effects of applying a complex function transformation \\\\( g(u) = \\\\cos(\\\\omega t)u +\\\\sin(\\\\omega t)u \\\\), with a constant \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), over time interval t.\n\nIf \\\\( g(u) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{u} = Mu\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{u} = Mu\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( g(u) \\\\) modifies the initial vector \\\\( u_0 \\\\) by introducing a combination of sine and cosine terms, which are time-dependent and will change the trajectory of the system under the transformation defined by M. The resulting trajectory at time T will be different, influenced by the oscillatory nature of \\\\( g(u) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation g(u) to the initial vector u0 at t=0 and then evolving it under \\(\\dot{u} = Mu\\) results in a different u(t) compared to directly evolving u0 under \\(\\dot{u} = Mu\\) from t=0 to t=T."
