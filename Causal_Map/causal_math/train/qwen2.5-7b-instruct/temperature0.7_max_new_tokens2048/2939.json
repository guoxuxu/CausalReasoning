  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + p(x) \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( p(x) \\\\) is a position-dependent velocity field. We analyze the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at a specific time.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{G} \\\\), such as a convolution with a Gaussian kernel, is applied as an intervention, will the Fourier transform of \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) depend only on the initial PDE and not on the actions of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\mathcal{G} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform will reflect both the effects of the initial evolution due to the PDE and the convolution intervention. As \\\\( \\\\mathcal{G} \\\\) can significantly alter the energy distribution across the Fourier modes, its effect cannot be isolated from that resulting from the initial PDE.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The position-dependent velocity field p(x) directly influences the spatial derivative of u with respect to x, and the initial PDE directly determines the evolution of u over time. Applying transformations F and G at a specific time t1 does not solely determine the future state of u for t > t1, as it depends on the initial PDE."
