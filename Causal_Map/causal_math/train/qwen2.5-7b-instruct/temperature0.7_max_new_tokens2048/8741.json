  "Problem": "Evaluate the effects of a Fourier transform on a causal system described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = -Ax + u(t) \\\\), where A is a constant scalar and u(t) is an external input. Assume \\\\( U(s) \\\\) is the Laplace transform of u(t) and consider the impact of transforming the initial conditions via a convolution with another function \\\\( h(t) \\\\).\n\nWill Fourier transforming the external input u(t) to \\\\( U(\\\\omega) \\\\) and then evolving the system according to Fourier-transformed dynamics change the final state compared to directly transforming the output signal x(t) from the time domain to the frequency domain?",
  "Explanation": "The process of Fourier transforming the input and then applying it to the transformed differential equation can yield different characteristics in frequency response due to phase shifts and frequency-dependent attenuation, as compared to transforming the output x(t) directly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The external input u(t) influences the system dynamics through the differential equation, which in turn affects the state x(t). Transforming u(t) to U(ω) modifies the system's input in the frequency domain, while transforming x(t) to X(s) directly modifies the system's output. The convolution with h(t) further alters the output in the time domain, leading to Y(t). The Fourier transform of the input U(ω) and the transformed output X(s) to Y(s) under the influence of A will have different impacts on the final state due to the different nature of transformations applied to input versus output."
