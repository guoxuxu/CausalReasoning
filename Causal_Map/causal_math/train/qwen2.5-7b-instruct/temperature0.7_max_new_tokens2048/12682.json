  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{az} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. We examine the effect of applying an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) on \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and its implications over the variable \\\\( s \\\\).\n\nIf an operator \\\\( L[f](t) = f'(t) + bf(t) \\\\) (where \\\\( b \\\\) is another complex constant) is applied to \\\\( g(t) \\\\) after the original transformation \\\\( T \\\\), will the new endpoint depend solely on \\\\( s \\\\) and not on \\\\( a \\\\) or \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the operator \\\\( L \\\\) changes the nature and the trajectory of the function. \\\\( L[g](t) = a e^{at} + b e^{at} = (a+b) e^{at} \\\\), and then taking \\\\( T[L[g]](s) \\\\) would yield \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-(a+b)} \\\\), thus showing dependence on both \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), alongside \\\\( s \\\\).",

List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the integral transformation T on g(t) results in a new function whose Laplace transform depends on s, while the operator L applied afterward transforms this function, with the new endpoint depending solely on s."
