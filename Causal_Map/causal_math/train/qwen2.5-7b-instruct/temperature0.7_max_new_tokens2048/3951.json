  "Problem": "Analyze the impact of performing a sequence of linear transformations and then applying a Laplace Transform L on a function g(t), where g(t) = e^(At)x for a constant matrix A and an initial vector x.\n\nIf another linear operator M is applied to x before forming g(t) such that ŷ(t) = e^(At)Mx and then performing L{ŷ(t)}, will L{ŷ(t)} still equal (sI - A)^-1 * x?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation M to x alters the initial conditions forming ŷ(t) = e^(At)Mx. Subsequent application of the Laplace Transform on ŷ(t) leads to L{ŷ(t)} = (sI - A)^-1 * Mx, which differs from L{g(t)} because of the inclusion of M, hence affecting the outcome of the transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
