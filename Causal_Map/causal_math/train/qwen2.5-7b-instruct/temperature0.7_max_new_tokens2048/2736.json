  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a constant matrix. The system undergoes analysis under the influence of a transformation, \\\\( g(x) = Cx \\\\), with C being another constant matrix, applied at an arbitrary time \\\\( t_0 \\\\).\n\nCan we precisely pinpoint the interventions used (whether \\\\( g(x) \\\\), \\\\( h(x) \\\\), or both) by observing the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions used based solely on the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is unfeasible due to the potential overlap in effects caused by the matrices C and E along with D. Different combinations of interventions may lead to the same or indiscernible endpoint owing to the linear nature and possible commutative properties of the transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
