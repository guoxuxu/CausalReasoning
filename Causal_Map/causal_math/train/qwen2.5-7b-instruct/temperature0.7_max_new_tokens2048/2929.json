  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\\\), where A and B are scalar constants determining the growth rate in two different components x and y, respectively, as functions of time t.\n\nIf the initial conditions \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and \\\\( y_0 \\\\) of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) are set at t = 0 and the system is allowed to evolve over time without any external intervention, will the relationship between initial conditions and \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for some T > 0 be explicitly traceable?",
  "Explanation": "The development of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is directly traceable from the exponential growth terms modulated by A and B. Since there are no additional transformations or external factors introduced after t = 0, \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can be accurately calculated and traced back to \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and \\\\( y_0 \\\\) using the given relations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial conditions x_0 and y_0, along with the constants A and B, directly cause the value of z(T) at any time T > 0."
