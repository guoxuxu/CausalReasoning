  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. Evaluate the change in the function through an integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int e^{bt}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( b \\\\) is a different complex number.\n\nGiven the result of \\\\( g(z(T)) \\\\) at t = T, can we uniquely recover \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Because the transformation aggregates influences over the interval from 0 to T and is dependent on both \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), it obscures the initial condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\). Without explicit knowledge that \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modified the function, \\\\( z(0) \\\\) cannot be uniquely inferred from \\\\( g(z(T)) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z(t) at any time t depends on the parameter a; the integral transformation g(z) with parameter b transforms z(t) over time; the value of g(z(T)) at time T influences the potential recovery of z(0), but this recovery is not guaranteed without additional information."
