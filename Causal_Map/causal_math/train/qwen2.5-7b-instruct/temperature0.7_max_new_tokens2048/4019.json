  "Problem": "Consider an integral transformation \\\\( T[u](x) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-xt} u(t) dt \\\\) applied to a function u(t). We study how applying another transformation \\\\( S[u](t) = \\\\int_0^t u(s) ds \\\\) either before or after T affects relations.\n\nIf intervention \\\\( S[u](t) \\\\) is applied at some intermediate time \\\\( t = t_1 \\\\), transforming u partially, and then the entire transformed u(t) undergoes transformation T, does the end result depend only on \\\\( T[u](x) \\\\) without intervention or both T and S?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting function after the intermediate application of S and then T depends on both transformations. S alters the function u(t) even if partially, and these changes will influence how T operates over the entire range, making the resultant u(x) dependent on the effects of both S and T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying S[u](t) before T[u](x) introduces an additional transformation that affects the outcome, which is distinct from the result obtained when T[u](x) is applied alone without any intervening S transformation."
