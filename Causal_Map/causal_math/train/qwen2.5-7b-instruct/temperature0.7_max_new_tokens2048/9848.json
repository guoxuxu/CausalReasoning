  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) applied to a variable \\\\( z \\\\) in the complex plane. The impact of this transformation is studied over the path of the unit circle in the complex plane, described by \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where \\\\( t \\in [0, 2\\\\pi] \\\\).\n\nGiven the ending point on the path at \\\\( t = 2\\\\pi \\\\), and knowing that an intervention was applied, can we reliably determine which transformations (\\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were used?",
  "Explanation": "Given the symmetrical nature of the unit circle and the type of transformations, multiple combination scenarios (applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) can lead to the same endpoint on the circle. The transformations' effects are not distinct enough to uniquely backtrack the applied sequence from the final point alone.",
