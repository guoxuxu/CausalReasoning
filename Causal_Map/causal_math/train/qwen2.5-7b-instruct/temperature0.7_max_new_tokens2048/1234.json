  "Problem": "Consider the effect of the complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + c \\\\) on the complex plane, where \\\\( c \\\\) is a fixed complex constant. This function is related to iterative mappings used in fractal generation like the Mandelbrot set. We investigate how initial values and transformations influence the resulting behavior after multiple iterations.\n\nCan the original value \\\\( c \\\\) be determined uniquely after observing the behavior of the sequence over a prolonged duration, i.e., whether it remains bounded?",
  "Explanation": "While the behavior of remaining bounded indicates that \\\\( c \\\\) lies within the Mandelbrot set, many different values of \\\\( c \\\\) can result in bounded sequences. This does not allow for a unique determination of \\\\( c \\\\) based only on the bounded nature of the sequence without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of c influences the behavior of the sequence, which in turn determines its boundedness."
