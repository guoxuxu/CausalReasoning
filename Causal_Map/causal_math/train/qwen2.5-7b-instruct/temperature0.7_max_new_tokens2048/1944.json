  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system characterized by the transfer function \\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+1} \\). We analyze the impact of a Laplace transform-based controller defined by \\( G(s) = s + k \\) for some constant \\( k \\) on the system's response.\n\nGiven the output \\( y(t) \\) at some time T, can we exactly determine the settings of \\( k \\) used in the controller \\( G(s) \\), assuming it was in effect?",
  "Explanation": "While the output \\( y(t) \\) is influenced by \\( k \\), the exact settings of \\( k \\) cannot necessarily be deduced just from \\( y(t) \\) due to the potential overlap of effects from different \\( k \\) values and the intrinsic properties of \\( H(s) \\). Multiple settings of \\( k \\) could potentially lead to similar or identical responses, depending on the specifics of the input and other system parameters.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
