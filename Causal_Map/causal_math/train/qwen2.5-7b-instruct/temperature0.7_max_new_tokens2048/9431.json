  "Problem": "Consider the control system defined by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Ky + u\\\\), where K is a constant matrix and \\\\(u\\\\) represents the control input. We examine the behavior under the transformation \\\\( y \\mapsto H(t) y \\\\), where \\\\(H(t) = e^{Mt}\\\\) and M is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf a function \\\\( G(y) = e^{Nt}y \\\\) (where N is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention at time t = t_2, will the future state \\\\(y(T)\\\\) for T > t_2 be independent of the matrix M?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(G(y)\\\\) at time t_2 adds another layer of complexity to the system's trajectory. Although the primary dynamics are governed by K and the control inputs, the intervening transformation by N and the initial transformation by M both influence \\\\(y(T)\\\\), thus making the state at time T dependent not only on K but also on M and N.",
