  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model in which the flow (\\\\( f(x) \\\\)) through a nonlinear system is described by a complex function \\\\( f(x) = e^{iz} \\\\), where \\\\( z = Ax + B \\\\), and A, B are matrices. We examine the impact of an integral transformation applied to \\\\( f(x) \\\\): (\\\\( T[g(x)] = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-ixt} g(x) dx \\\\)), for a function \\\\( g(x) \\\\).\n\nGiven the output of the transformation \\\\( T[f(x)] \\\\), can the original function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) be uniquely determined without knowing whether the complex function or the linear transformation was applied first?",
  "Explanation": "Since the nonlinear transformation can significantly alter the structure of \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and the linear transformation can modify the spectral components, not knowing the order of operations makes it impossible to uniquely reconstruct \\\\( g(x) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
