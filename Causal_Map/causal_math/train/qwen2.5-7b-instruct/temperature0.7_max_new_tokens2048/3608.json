  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The function describes a circular motion in the complex plane. We analyze the impact of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\alpha t} z \\\\), where \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of values and timings for \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\beta \\\\) could result in the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\) due to the multiplicative nature of the exponential functions, making it challenging to deduce the interventions precisely.",

List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
