  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) defined in the complex plane where \\\\( z(x) = e^{ix} \\\\). We investigate the causal relationships under transformations by the function \\\\( g(z) = z^k \\\\), where k is a non-zero integer.\n\nIf at some point x_1 > x_0 a new transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^m \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(x) \\\\), will the behavior of \\\\( z(x) \\\\) at x = T (where T > x_1) depend solely on the initial transformation and not on the new intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention modifies the system again, changing the trajectory to \\\\( z(x) = (e^{ikx})^m = e^{ikmx} \\\\). The behavior at x = T will depend on both k and m, which govern different rates of rotation after each transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
