  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable \\\\( z \\\\) given by \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-sz} ds \\\\), which is an integral transformation. We assess the behavior and relationships of this function under different transformations \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nIf a transformation \\\\( z \\\\mapsto z + a \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real positive number, and then \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is computed, will the result always be bounded?",
  "Explanation": "Transforming \\\\( z \\\\) by adding a positive real constant \\\\( a \\\\) ensures the real part of \\\\( z \\\\) is positive or increases, leading the exponential function \\\\( e^{-sz} \\\\) to decay more strongly, ensuring the integral is always bounded.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation z → z + a results in a new function value h(z + a), which depends on the original function h(z) through the parameter s."
