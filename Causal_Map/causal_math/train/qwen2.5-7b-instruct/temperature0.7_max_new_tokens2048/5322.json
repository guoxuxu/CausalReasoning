  "Problem": "Consider a system expressed by the linear transformation \\\\( T(x) = Ax \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix. We explore the effect of an additional functional transformation \\\\( g(x) = Ux \\\\), where \\\\( U \\\\) is a unitary matrix, on the eigenvalues of the vector \\\\( x \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on the application of \\\\( g(x) \\\\), and knowing that \\\\( U \\\\) can fundamentally change the vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) while preserving eigenvalues, it is impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( x_0 \\\\) from \\\\( x(t) \\\\) because multiple vectors with altered directions can share the same eigenvalues.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The original vector x(0) influences x(t), and the transformation g(x) also influences x(t). Observing x(t) at time t allows us to trace back to x(0) if g(x) is known or can be accounted for."
