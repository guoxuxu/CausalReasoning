  "Problem": "Consider an electrical system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = v\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) describes the voltage distribution over a line at position x and time t, and v is a positive constant reflecting the properties of the material. We examine the effects of applying a Fourier transformation \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) defined by \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} u(x,t) e^{-ikx} dx\\\\) at time t = 0.\n\nGiven the observed state \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\), can we determine precisely what transformations were used (whether \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\\\), or both), solely based on the state at time \\\\(T\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final observed state \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) could potentially result from various combinations of transformations and even different initial conditions within certain constraints. Disambiguating the specific sequence of transformations used without additional information is not possible due to the linearity and potential overlapping effects of the operations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "u(x,T) → observed state; observed state → can determine transformations",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The voltage distribution at time T (u(x,T)) directly influences the observed state, which in turn allows us to infer the transformations applied."
