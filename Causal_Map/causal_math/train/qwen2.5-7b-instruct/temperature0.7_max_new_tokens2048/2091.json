  "Problem": "Consider a function mapping from the complex plane to itself given by \\\\( z \\mapsto w = e^{az+b} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants. We investigate the effects of this transformation under the integral transformation defined by \\\\( \\int_C f(z) \\, dz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a contour in the complex plane.\n\nIf a corrective transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{-az-b} \\\\) is applied during the integral transformation of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), will the result solely depend on the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) without any influence from \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The corrective transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{-az-b} \\\\) neutralizes the effect of \\\\( e^{az+b} \\\\) applied earlier. This results in the integral effectively being over the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\), independent of the values of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\). The effects of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are consequently nullified.",
