  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\) where s is a complex number. Analyze the causality and effects of modifying the function by a multiplicative factor \\\\( h(t) = e^{kt} \\\\), where k is a constant.\n\nIf at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention shifts the function to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by multiplying with \\\\( m(t) = e^{pt} \\\\) where p is a constant, will the nature of the initial transformation by \\\\( h(t) \\\\) affect the final outcome \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) after the application of both \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( m(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both transformations apply multiplicative exponential modifications to the function. The interventions sequentially transform the function into \\\\( z_0(t) e^{kt} e^{pt} \\\\) by the time of transformation. This results in an endpoint influenced distinctly by both k and p (even with commutativity), reflected in the transform being \\\\( Z(s-k-p) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
