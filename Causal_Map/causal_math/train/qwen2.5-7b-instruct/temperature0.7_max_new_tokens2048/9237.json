  "Problem": "Investigate a system subjected to the Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = F(s) \\\\) and its inverse, influencing a time-dependent function \\\\( g(t) \\\\). The function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is initially impacted by a transformation \\\\( h(t) = t^2 g(t) \\\\) and analyzed for causality and effects of transformations.\n\nIf \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is applied to function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and then it evolves under its intrinsic properties without further intervention, will the Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) at s = a be equivalent to the transform of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) at the same s?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(t) = t^2 g(t) \\\\) changes the original function, resulting in a different Laplace transform due to the added \\\\( t^2 \\\\) term, which modifies the s-domain representation by shifting poles and potentially altering convergence properties.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
