  "Problem": "Consider a matrix function \\( z(t) \\) associated with a complex function \\( f(z) = z^2 \\), where \\( z \\) evolves over time according to the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = -iz \\). We examine how an eigenvalue transformation \\( F(z) = e^{\\lambda t}z \\) affects \\( z(t) \\), with \\( \\lambda \\) being a complex constant.\n\nGiven the state \\( z(T) \\), can we determine precisely which transformations (whether \\( F(z) \\), \\( G(z) \\), or both) were applied, purely by observing \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions based solely on \\( z(T) \\) is challenging because different combinations of \\( \\lambda \\) and \\( \\mu \\) values can yield similar or even identical states at \\( T \\), especially given the complex interactions and the effects of exponentials in complex planes, leading to non-unique solutions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of z(t) over time, driven by the differential equation, leads to z(T). The application of the eigenvalue transformation F(z) or G(z), parameterized by λt, influences z(t) but does not uniquely determine which transformation was applied based solely on observing z(T)."
