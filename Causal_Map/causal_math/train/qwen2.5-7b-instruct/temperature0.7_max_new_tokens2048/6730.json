  "Problem": "Consider a system in which the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) in a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where k is a constant diffusivity. The rod undergoes a transformation due to a boundary condition change represented by \\\\( u(0,t) = e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) at one end, with \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) being a constant.\n\nUsing the thermal profile \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at time T, can we precisely infer whether the boundary condition \\\\( u(0,t) = e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Various initial and boundary conditions could yield similar temperature distributions at time T due to the nature of heat diffusion, making it challenging to uniquely identify the presence of the specific exponential boundary condition without additional data.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The boundary condition u(0,t) = e^(αt) directly influences the thermal profile u(x,T) through the heat equation, and the thermal profile u(x,T) reflects the effect of the boundary condition u(0,t) = e^(αt)."
