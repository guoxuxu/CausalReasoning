  "Problem": "Consider the integration transformation \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-zt} f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a given function and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. This transformation maps a function from the time domain to the Laplace transform in the complex domain.\n\nIf \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is altered by substituting a continuous function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) for \\\\( f(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and this is the only change made before finding \\\\( G(z) \\\\), will the new transform \\\\( H(z) \\\\) be equal to \\\\( G(z) \\\\) for all \\\\( z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The alteration of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to include \\\\( h(t) \\\\) changes the function being transformed, thus affecting the outcome of the Laplace transform. The new function \\\\( H(z) \\\\) will generally not be the same as \\\\( G(z) \\\\) unless \\\\( h(t) \\\\) satisfies very specific criteria that make it equivalent to \\\\( f(t) \\\\) in the integral transformation.",
