  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where t is time. We analyze the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under the integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} z(s) \\\\, ds \\\\).\n\nGiven the transform \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at time T, can we recover the exact original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) for all t in [0, T]?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) introduces ambiguities; multiple functions could yield the same integrated result due to the loss of specific phase information at individual times.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
