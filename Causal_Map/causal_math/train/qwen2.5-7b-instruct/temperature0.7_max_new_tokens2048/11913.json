  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in the complex domain, defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), representing a unit circle in the complex plane. Evaluate the transformations on this function using the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), where the Laplace transform is given by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\).\n\nCan the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be exactly determined after only observing its Laplace transform without knowing it was \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) is unique, and recovering the original function from its transform, under ideal conditions where the transform is defined, is theoretically straightforward given the properties of the transform. Practical limitations include the convergence issues for the integral.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
