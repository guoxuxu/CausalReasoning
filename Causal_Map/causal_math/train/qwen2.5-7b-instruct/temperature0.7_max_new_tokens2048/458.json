  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s^2 + as + b} \\\\), and consider its Laplace transform, which gives a function in the complex plane. Assume that this function represents the transfer function of a control system, where a and b are constants.\n\nGiven the output and knowing \\\\( z(s) \\\\), can you uniquely determine the input to the system without knowing additional conditions or interventions?",
  "Explanation": "No, because multiple different input signals can result in the same output due to the properties of Laplace transforms and convolution. The system might also have inherent properties (like zero states) that can affect the input needed to achieve a particular output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "z(s) → Transfer_function; a → Transfer_function; b → Transfer_function",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The values of z(s) depend on the transfer function, which in turn depends on the constants a and b."
