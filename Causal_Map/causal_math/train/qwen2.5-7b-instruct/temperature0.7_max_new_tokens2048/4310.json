  "Problem": "Let's examine a continuity equation \\\\(\\\\partial_t u + \\\\nabla \\\\cdot (vu) = 0\\\\), where v is a fixed velocity field. Consider the Fourier transformation \\\\(F(u)(k)=\\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}^n} e^{-ikx}u(x) dx\\\\) applied to the function u. We explore how this transformation affects the evolution of u over time.\n\nGiven the transformed function u(t) at t = T, is it possible to perfectly deduce the initial function u at t = 0 without knowing the Fourier transform was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is an invertible transformation; hence, its application and its inverse can regain the original function from its transformed state at any point in time, provided that u evolves according to the given continuity equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Fourier transform of u at time t, F(u)(k), influences the evolution of u over time, leading to u(T) at time T. Knowing u(T) allows us to infer the initial function u at t=0, assuming no other transformations or changes were applied."
