  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a vector differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\) where D is a diagonalizable matrix. The transformation \\\\( g(z) = K^{-1}e^{Lt}Kz \\\\), where K is a matrix diagonalizing D (i.e., \\\\(D = K L K^{-1}\\\\)), and L is a diagonal matrix, is applied to observe its behavior under system evolution.\n\nIf a new function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Mt}z \\\\) (where M is a constant matrix) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on D and not on M?",
  "Explanation": "The system, after being affected by \\\\( h(z) \\\\), does not only evolve according to D. The intervening application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) alters the trajectory by introducing a new dynamic characterized by matrix M, thereby making the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) a compound result of D and M.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The endpoint z(T) depends on D but not on M after time T1; M influences z(T1) which then evolves to z(T) through T1."
