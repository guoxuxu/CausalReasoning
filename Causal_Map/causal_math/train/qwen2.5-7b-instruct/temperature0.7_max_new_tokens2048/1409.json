  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency. This function is integrated over time using the transformation \\\\(F(z) = \\int_0^T f(t) z(t) dt\\\\). Let's analyze the behavior of this integral transformation when a parameter adjustment, represented by function \\\\(g(z) = ze^{i\\theta}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) is a constant, is either applied initially or during the process.\n\nIf the parameter adjustment \\\\(g(z)\\\\) is applied to \\\\(z(0)\\\\) at t = 0, and the function is then left to evolve as \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\\\) over the period from 0 to T, will the result of \\\\(F(z)\\\\) for T > 0 be the same as if \\\\(z(0)\\\\) was not adjusted?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(g(z)\\\\) at the initial time t = 0 modifies the trajectory by introducing a phase shift \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\). Consequently, the entire function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is affected by this phase for all t, leading to a different result for \\\\(F(z)\\\\) due to the change in the integral's limits and the properties of complex exponentials.",
