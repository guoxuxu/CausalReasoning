  "Problem": "Consider an electrical RC (Resistor-Capacitor) circuit where the voltage across the capacitor is described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dV}{dt} = -\\\\frac{1}{RC}V + \\\\frac{1}{R}I(t)\\\\), with R being the resistance, C the capacitance, and I(t) a time-varying input current. We analyze the behavior of this system under the function \\\\( g(V) = V + e^{At}\\\\), where A is a constant.\n\nGiven the voltage \\\\( V(T) \\\\) observed at T, can we determine the initial voltage \\\\( V_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether the function \\\\( g(V) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(V) \\\\), it's impossible to uniquely determine the original state \\\\( V_0 \\\\) because the addition of \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) at the beginning could cause identical end states from different initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The voltage V at time T is influenced by the initial voltage V_0, the input current I(t), the resistance R, and the capacitance C. Applying the function g(V) does not directly affect the determination of V_0 from V(T) if g(V) is known."
