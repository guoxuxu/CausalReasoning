  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions describing a particle's position in two-dimensional space over time. We analyze how the system behaves under the influence of a transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) (where B is another complex constant) is applied at t = t_1, will the final position \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 solely depend on the dynamics defined initially and not on the transformations introduced by A or B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervening transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at t = t_1 modifies the trajectory in a compounded manner with the initial transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\), resulting in a final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) that depends on both A and B. The effects of A and B accumulate, influencing the trajectory and consequently the final state in a way that is not solely dictated by natural dynamics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The position z(t) is directly influenced by x(t), y(t), A, and B. Applying the transformation g(z) = e^(Bt)z at t = t_1 introduces a dependency on B, which affects z(t) for T > t_1."
