  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the integral equation \\(\\int_0^t K(t-u) x(u) du = y(t)\\), where \\(K(s)\\) is a complex kernel function and \\(x(t)\\) is the input function. We study the changes in the output \\( y(t) \\) under the transformations initiated by different input functions such as \\( g(x) = x + Ae^{-\\lambda t} \\) for some constant matrix \\( A \\) and scalar \\( \\lambda \\).\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\( x_0(t) \\) at t = 0 after observing \\( y(t) \\) at t = T without knowing whether \\( g(x) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about the application of \\( g(x) \\), any changes introduced by the transformation \\( Ae^{-\\lambda t} \\) make it challenging to accurately reconstruct \\( x_0(t) \\) purely from \\( y(t) \\) at T, since multiple input functions could lead to similar outputs due to the convolution properties of integral transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input function x(t) directly causes the output y(t). The transformation g(x) indirectly affects x(t), which in turn influences y(t). Observing y(t) at time T allows inference about the initial state x_0(0) of the system."
