  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) mapping real numbers to complex numbers. We explore the transformation driven by the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), applied to this function resulting in \\\\(Z(\\\\omega)\\\\), and analyze its impact under different conditions.\n\nGiven the transformed output \\\\(Z(\\\\omega)\\\\), can we determine precisely which interventions (scaling, multiplication by time, both, or neither) were used, only by analyzing \\\\(Z(\\\\omega)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations impact the Fourier coefficients in ways that can lead to similar spectral characteristics under different interventions. The potential overlap in the effects caused by different types of modifications to the original function makes it impossible to uniquely identify the interventions from just the transformed output.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
