  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the equation \\\\( z = f(x) = x^3 + 3x^2 + 2 \\\\) and its Laplace Transform, which transforms the function into the s-domain as \\\\( F(s) \\\\). We explore whether the transformed system under differently parameterized transformations still retains causal relationships.\n\nIf an initial value \\\\( x_0 \\\\) is transformed to \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and evolved under the Laplace domain without intervention, will the inverse Laplace transform at any point s = s_1 give the direct mathematical evolution of \\\\( x_0 \\\\) under \\\\( f(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform is a bijective linear operator for the sorts of elementary functions described, and performing operations in the s-domain equivalent to those in the x-domain maintains the causal structure due to the linearity and reversibility of the transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial value x_0 directly influences F(s), which then inversely transforms back to x(t) through the inverse Laplace transform; s_1 specifies a point in time for the value of x(t)."
