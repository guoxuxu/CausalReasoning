  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution \\( T(x, t) \\) over a rod of length L is described by the heat equation \\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2} \\), where \\( k \\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We explore the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\) to the initial temperature distribution \\( T(x, 0) \\).\n\nIf an intervention alters the system by applying a heat source varying over time, described by the function \\( g(x, t) \\), after applying the Fourier transform to \\( T(x, 0) \\), will the temperature distribution \\( T(x, t) \\) at time \\( t \\) depend only on the heat equation without considering the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the variable heat source \\( g(x, t) \\) modifies the system dynamics, leading \\( T(x, t) \\) to depend on both the heat equation and the characteristics of \\( g(x, t) \\). The Fourier transform's initial application does not nullify effects of the dynamic intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The temperature distribution T(x, t) at time t depends on the initial temperature distribution T(x, 0), the thermal diffusivity constant k, and the heat source function g(x, t). Applying the Fourier transform to the initial temperature distribution changes T(x, 0) to its frequency domain representation, which then influences T(x, t) through the heat equation."
