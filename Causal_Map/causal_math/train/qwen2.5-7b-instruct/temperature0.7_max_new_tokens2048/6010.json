  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 z = 0 \\\\) in a domain \\\\( D \\\\) with boundary conditions modified by a function \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\) on the boundary \\\\( \\\\partial D \\\\). Analyze the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) \\\\) to solve for the internal values of \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nCan the original boundary conditions on \\\\( \\\\partial D \\\\) be uniquely determined based solely on knowledge of the solution \\\\( z \\\\) inside \\\\( D \\\\) after applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the Fourier transform provides a method to solve for \\\\( z \\\\) under given boundary conditions, obtaining \\\\( z \\\\) inside \\\\( D \\\\) does not uniquely determine what these boundary conditions were, especially without further information about how the transform and the inverse transform were applied and computed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The boundary condition h(x, y) directly influences the internal values z of the function in domain D; applying the Fourier transform to z yields z', which represents the transformed solution within D."
