  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{mt} \\\\\\) where \\\\( m \\\\) is a complex number, evolving in a system governed by the differential equation \\\\( z'(t) = kz(t) \\\\\\), with \\\\( k \\\\) being a real constant. We explore the effect of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{nt}z \\\\), applied at different times, where \\\\( n \\\\) is another complex number.\n\nCan we determine the initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) if we do not know whether transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The absence of knowledge regarding the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) means that multiple initial conditions could lead to the same observed outcome at time T, especially considering the complex nature of \\\\( n \\\\) which affects magnitude and phase.",
