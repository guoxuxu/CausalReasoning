  "Problem": "Evaluate the system of differential equations characterized by the Laplace transform of functions and their inverse. Let \\\\( X(s) \\\\) be the Laplace transform of a function x(t), and \\\\( H(s) \\\\) the transfer function of a linear system. The response of the system is given by \\\\( Y(s) = H(s)X(s) \\\\), where \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is the inverse Laplace transform of \\\\( Y(s) \\\\).\n\nDoes modifying \\\\( X(s) \\\\) by scaling it with a factor \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) prior to input into the system defined by \\\\( H(s) \\\\) change the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) compared to scaling \\\\( x(t) \\\\) by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) after the system processing?",
  "Explanation": "Scaling \\\\( X(s) \\\\) by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) before the transformation and scaling \\\\( x(t) \\\\) by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) after the system processes it are equivalent due to the linearity of the system and the properties of the Laplace transform. The output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) remains proportionally the same in both cases.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
