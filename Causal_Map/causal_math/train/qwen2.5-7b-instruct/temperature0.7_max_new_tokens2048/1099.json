  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace Transform, having a transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) is the complex frequency. This scenario explores causal inference in system responses by examining different excitation functions and their respective impacts.\n\nIf a step function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is applied initially and an intervention modifies the transfer function to \\\\( G(s) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final output at time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) still solely represent the response of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) initially described?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changing the transfer function to \\\\( G(s) \\\\) alters how the system reacts to the input, regardless of the initial application of \\\\( H(s) \\\\). Consequently, the output from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to \\\\( T \\\\) will reflect the properties of \\\\( G(s) \\\\), not just \\\\( H(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "A step function u(t) directly influences the initial output. The transfer function H(s) initially describes this output. At time t_1, modifying the transfer function to G(s) changes the output from that point onwards. Therefore, for times T > t_1, the output represents the response of G(s) rather than H(s)."
