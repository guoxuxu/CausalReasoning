  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) and its impact under a Fourier transformation, specifically looking at \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{f(z)\\\\}(k) \\\\). The parameter \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nObserving only the Fourier transform output of a manipulated \\\\( f(z) \\\\), can we decide whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) or another transformation was applied before the Fourier transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform output can be substantially similar for different preliminary transformations applied to \\\\( f(z) \\\\), especially given the diverse effects these transformations can have on the function. Without specific knowledge of what transformation was applied, distinguishing based purely on the Fourier transform result is generally infeasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The parameter a directly influences the function f(z), which then determines the Fourier transform F(k). The transformation g(z) results in h(z), which leads to the Fourier transform F'(k). Both f(z) and h(z) can result in F'(k), making it impossible to determine from F'(k) alone whether g(z) or the original f(z) was transformed."
