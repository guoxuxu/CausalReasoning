  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex number. We analyze this function's impact when applied as a transformation within an integral, specifically for the integral \\\\( I = \\\\int_0^T e^{az} \\\\, dz \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant complex number.\n\nGiven the value of the transformed integral \\\\( \\\\int_0^T e^{a e^z} \\\\, dz \\\\), can we infer the original value of \\\\( a \\\\) used in \\\\( I = \\\\int_0^T e^{az} \\\\, dz \\\\) before the transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The value of the transformed integral results from a complex and exponential growth pattern that obscures the linear factor \\\\( a \\\\) in a way that cannot be uniquely reversed or deduced just from the result of the integral.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
