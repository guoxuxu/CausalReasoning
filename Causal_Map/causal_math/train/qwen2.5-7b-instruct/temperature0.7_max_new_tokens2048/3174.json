  "Problem": "Consider a complex system where the output signal \\( z(t) \\) is determined by applying a Laplace transform \\( L \\) to an input signal \\( x(t) \\). The transfer function in the Laplace domain is given by \\( H(s) = \\frac{s + a}{s + b} \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are constants.\n\nGiven the output \\( z(t) \\) obtained from applying the Laplace transform to \\( x(t) \\), can we infer the original \\( x(t) \\) without knowing any modifications like \\( m(t) \\) were applied to \\( x(t) \\) before transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of prior modifications such as \\( m(t) \\) application, it is impossible to correctly infer \\( x(t) \\) from \\( z(t) \\). The modification could alter \\( x(t) \\) in various ways, making it indistinguishable and non-recoverable based solely on \\( z(t) \\) and \\( H(s) \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The input signal x(t) is transformed by the Laplace transform to produce the output signal z(t), and this transformation is further modified by the transfer function H(s) in the Laplace domain."
