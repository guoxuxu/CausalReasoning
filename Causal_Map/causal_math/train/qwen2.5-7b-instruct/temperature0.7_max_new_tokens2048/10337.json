  "Problem": "Assume a complex function scenario where \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) evolves over time t governed by \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az\\\\), with A being a complex constant. We analyze the impact of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where B is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to develop under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be identical to if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was simply evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) modifies the initial point, altering the trajectory of the system. The presence of the exponential factor \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) can significantly change the system dynamics depending on how A and B interact, resulting in a different point at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation f(z) to z_0 at t=0 and then evolving it under dz/dt = Az for time T results in the same z(t) as evolving z_0 directly under dz/dt = Az for time T; A and B independently affect z(t) through their respective transformations."
