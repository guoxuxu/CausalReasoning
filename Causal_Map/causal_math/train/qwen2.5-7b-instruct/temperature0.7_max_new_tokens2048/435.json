  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant. The system undergoes a Laplace transformation \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{z(t)\\} \\). Analyze the causal relationship between initial conditions, transformations, and system outputs.\n\nIf the system's state at a time \\( t_1 \\) undergoes an intervention through a Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F} \\{z(t)\\} \\), will the system's state at a later time \\( T \\) be governed only by the natural dynamics \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) alters the system's state significantly, introducing another layer of complexity into the evolution. The final state \\( z(T) \\) now depends on both the natural dynamics and the effects of the Fourier transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The system's state at time t1 (z(t1)) directly influences its state at a later time T (z(T)) through the Fourier transform (F{z(t)}). The Fourier transform of the system's state at t1 governs the state at time T."
