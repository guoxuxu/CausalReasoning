  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\kappa \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\kappa\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. Consider the modification of the initial temperature distribution by the function \\\\( g(u) = u + \\\\sin(\\\\omega x) \\\\), with \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) being a constant frequency.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention by another function \\\\( h(u) = u \\\\times \\\\cos(\\\\beta x) \\\\) is applied, will the final temperature distribution at a later time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be affected only by the initial conditions set by \\\\( g(u) \\\\) on \\\\( u_0 \\\\) and not by \\\\( h(u) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional intervention with \\\\( h(u) \\\\) modifies the temperature distribution again by introducing a multiplicative cosine term, further complicating the temporal evolution of the temperature field under the heat equation. Both the initial sine addition and subsequent cosine multiplication affect the final state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "g(u) → u_0; h(u) → u; u_0 → u; u → ∂u/∂t; κ → ∂²u/∂x²",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u_0 is modified by g(u) to become the initial temperature distribution. Then, h(u) modifies u, but after t_1, u evolves according to the heat equation driven by its own value and κ, so the effect of h(u) on u at T > t_1 is indirect through the evolution of u over time."
