  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real functions governed by the differential equations \\\\(du/dt = Au\\\\) and \\\\(dv/dt = Bv\\\\), with A and B being constant scalars. The transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{Ct}z\\\\) is applied, where C is a constant scalar.\n\nCan we determine the initial complex number \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Lacking information about the application of \\\\(f(z)\\\\) makes it impossible to uniquely reconstruct the initial state \\\\(z_0\\\\). The transformation could have altered the initial conditions such that multiple possible initial states could lead to the same observed state at T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial values of u and v at t=0 determine z(0), which through the function f(z) transformed by time t and constant C results in z(T). Therefore, observing z(t) at t=T allows us to infer z(0) if f(z) was not applied."
