  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\kappa \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) are constants. We consider the impact of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) on this system.\n\nIf the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and then the function is allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\kappa \\\\) without further transformations, does the Laplace domain representation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) remain invariant?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) converts it from the time domain to the frequency domain, fundamentally changing its representation. The original differential equation's dynamics are specific to the time domain and do not directly map to their Laplace domain counterparts without accounting for initial conditions precisely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of omega influences the rate of change of z, the value of kappa also influences the rate of change of z, z(t) transforms to Z(s) via the Laplace transform, and Z(s) represents the Laplace domain representation of z(t)'s rate of change."
