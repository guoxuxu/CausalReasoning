  "Problem": "Consider the analytical solution of the heat equation \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\) under initial conditions that can be represented as a Fourier transform. An operation \\\\( f(u) = u + e^{i\\\\omega_0 x} \\\\) is introduced, where \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nIf an additional perturbation represented by \\\\( g(u) = u + e^{-i\\\\alpha x} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is another constant frequency) is introduced as an intervention at a later time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the temperature profile \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the initial perturbation and not on the nature of \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( g(u) \\\\) adds another independent sinusoidal perturbation to the evolving solution. The final state \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) depends not only on the original perturbation \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) from \\\\( f(u) \\\\) but also on the new perturbation \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) introduced at \\\\( t_1 \\\\). Each sinusoidal component will evolve under the heat equation, affecting the overall temperature distribution at any given time thereafter.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The introduction of perturbations f(u) and g(u) at time t_1 changes the temperature profile u(x,T) for T > t_1. The nature of frequencies ω_0 and α influences the form of these perturbations but does not independently affect the dependency of u(x,T) on the initial conditions after t_1."
