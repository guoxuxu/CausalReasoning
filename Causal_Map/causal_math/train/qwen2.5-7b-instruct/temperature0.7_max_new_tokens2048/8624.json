  "Problem": "Let's consider a functional space where we deal with the operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) defined by the Laplace Transform. We analyze the causality and effect relations within signals \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and their Laplace Transforms \\\\( X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(x(t)) \\\\).\n\nKnowing only the transformed output \\\\( X_{new}(s) \\\\) from the previous case, is it possible to determine both the original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and the exact filtering function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) used?",
  "Explanation": "This results in an undetermined problem where multiple pairs of \\\\( X(s) \\\\) and \\\\( H(s) \\\\) could theoretically produce the same \\\\( X_{new}(s) \\\\). Without additional constraints or information about either the signal or the filter, it is not feasible to uniquely resolve both.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
