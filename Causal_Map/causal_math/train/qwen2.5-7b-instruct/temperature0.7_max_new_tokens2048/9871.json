  "Problem": "Investigate the system behavior under the linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = Az + b \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a matrix and \\\\( b \\\\) is a vector. We study its response when manipulated with the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z + d \\\\) where \\\\( C \\\\) is also a matrix and \\\\( d \\\\) is a vector, over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention represented by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z + d \\\\) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does this affect the system such that \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is determined only by the dynamics of \\\\( A \\\\) and not \\\\( C \\\\) or \\\\( d \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the trajectory and the final state of the system. Thus, the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is a result not only of the properties and actions of \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), but also of \\\\( C \\\\), \\\\( d \\\\), and the timing of the intervention, influencing the system's progression and final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
