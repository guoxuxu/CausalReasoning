  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a constant matrix, and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. The system is analyzed under the transformation defined by the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) applied to a function \\\\( h(t) = e^{-At^2} \\\\).\n\nAfter observing the Fourier Transform output, can we uniquely determine whether \\\\( e^{-At^2} \\\\) was indeed the initial function without a priori knowing A?",
  "Explanation": "The specific effects of matrix A on \\\\( t^2 \\\\) in \\\\( e^{-At^2} \\\\) are embedded within the transform and obscured by the integral operations of the Fourier Transform. Without knowing A, other similar transformations could yield indistinguishable results, thus not allowing unique reconstruction of the initial function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
