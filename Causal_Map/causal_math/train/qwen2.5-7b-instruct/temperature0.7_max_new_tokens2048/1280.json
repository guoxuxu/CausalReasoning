  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), and this function is applied in a complex analysis setting. We explore the role of a contour integral transformation of this function over a closed path in the complex plane.\n\nKnowing that an intervention altered the contour path during integration and the resultant integral value is non-zero, can we deduce that the new path encloses at least one additional singularity of \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given that \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) is entire and contains no singularities, a non-zero integral despite the function's nature suggests a calculation error or a misunderstanding of the contour's relation to singularity enclosures, as no singularities exist for this function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "An intervention altering the contour path leads to a non-zero integral value, which indicates the path now encloses at least one additional singularity."
