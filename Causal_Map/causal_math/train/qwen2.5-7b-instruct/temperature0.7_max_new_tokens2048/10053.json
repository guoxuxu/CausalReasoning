  "Problem": "Examine a system where electric potential V is described by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 V = 0\\\\) within a region and manipulate the boundary conditions to observe causal effects. We're especially interested in how transformations such as conformal mappings can infer changes in electric field distributions.\n\nIf a conformal mapping \\\\(f(z) = z^2\\\\) is applied to transform the spatial domain, does this change the solution \\\\(V\\\\) within the new domain although starting with the same boundary conditions in the original domain?",
  "Explanation": "Conformal mappings preserve the angle but not the length, distorting distances and therefore affecting the gradient of potential, \\\\(\\\\nabla V\\\\). Since boundary conditions are the same but the domain shape changes, the solution inside the domain, i.e., the distribution of electric potential, will differ.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying a conformal mapping f(z) = z^2 transforms the spatial domain, which changes the solution V to V_new while maintaining the same boundary conditions. The original solution V and the new solution V_new are causally linked through the transformation and the unchanged boundary conditions."
