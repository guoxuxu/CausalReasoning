  "Problem": "Explore the system characterized by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\) with a given constant matrix M. Consider the effect of the Laplace transform \\\\(F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s)\\\\) and how different initial conditions affect the system. We assume M and s are such that all operations and the inverse transform are well-defined.\n\nIf an intervention changes the matrix M to a new matrix N at a time \\\\(t_1\\\\), and we continue to observe \\\\(Z(s)\\\\), does the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) depend only on the initial condition, independent of the change in the system matrix?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention that changes M to N modifies the system dynamics. The effect of the matrix change alters the resultant state trajectory, thereby making \\\\(z(T)\\\\) dependent on the properties of both M and N, not solely on the initial condition.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition directly influences z(t), which is further influenced by the matrix M and then transformed to Z(s). Changing M to N at time t_1 affects z(t) from that point onward, and this change propagates to the final state z(T). Thus, z(T) depends on both the initial condition and the change in M."
