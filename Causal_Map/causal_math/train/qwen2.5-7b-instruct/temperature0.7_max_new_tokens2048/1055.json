  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator. We investigate the effect of applying a Fourier transformation \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t))\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) represents the Fourier space variable, on the system's behavior over time.\n\nIf at some intermediate time \\\\(t_1\\\\), a filtering operation characterized by a function \\\\(\\\\hat{g}(k)\\\\) is applied in Fourier space, will the final state \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) for T > t_1 solely depend on the operator \\\\(L\\\\) and not \\\\(\\\\hat{g}(k)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the filter \\\\(\\\\hat{g}(k)\\\\) alters the state in Fourier space, affecting the components of \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t)\\\\) based on the filter characteristics. This change will directly affect the final state at time T, making it dependent on both \\\\(L\\\\) and the nature of \\\\(\\\\hat{g}(k)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "u(x, t) → u(x, t_1); u(x, t_1) → hat{u}(k, t_1); hat{u}(k, t_1) → hat{u}(k, T); hat{g}(k) → hat{u}(k, T)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state u(x, t) evolves over time to u(x, t_1), which then transforms to hat{u}(k, t_1) via Fourier transformation. Applying a filtering operation hat{g}(k) in Fourier space affects hat{u}(k, t_1) leading to hat{u}(k, T). Thus, the final state hat{u}(k, T) depends on both the operator L and the filtering function hat{g}(k)."
