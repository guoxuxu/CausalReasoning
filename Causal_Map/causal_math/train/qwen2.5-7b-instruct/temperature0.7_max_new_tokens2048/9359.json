  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit composed of a resistor (R), inductor (L), capacitor (C), and a power source that applies a voltage \\\\( V(t) = V_0 e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\). Here, \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. The system is described by the differential equation \\\\( V(t) = L\\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI + \\\\frac{1}{C} \\\\int_0^t I(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( I(t) \\\\) is the current as a function of time.\n\nIf a parallel resistor \\\\( R_2 \\\\) is added into the circuit as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the steady state current depend only on \\\\( R \\\\) and not on \\\\( R_2 \\\\) or \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of a parallel resistor \\\\( R_2 \\\\) alters the overall impedance of the circuit, contributing to the total effective resistance and modifying the response of the circuit to the input frequency. Both the magnitude and phase of the steady state current will depend on \\\\( R_2 \\\\) in addition to the existing parameters \\\\( R \\\\), \\\\( L \\\\), and \\\\( C \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
