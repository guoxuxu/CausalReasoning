  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the wave equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is the wave speed. Investigate the effect of introducing a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) = u_0(x) \\\\).\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) is transformed to \\\\( \\\\hat{u}_0(\\\\xi) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u_0)(\\\\xi) \\\\) and then evolved according to the wave equation without further intervention, will \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > 0 be identical to the wave evolution from the untransformed \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform changes the modal composition of the wave, influencing how each mode evolves over time. The transformation to the frequency domain and subsequent evolution can alter the phase and amplitude of each component differently compared to the spatial domain evolution.",
