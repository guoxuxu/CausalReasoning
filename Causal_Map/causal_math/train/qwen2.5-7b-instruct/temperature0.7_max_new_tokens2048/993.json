  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\), where i is the imaginary unit. We examine the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) to the system, where A is a constant complex matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and the system then evolves according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\) without further interventions, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any t > 0 be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) evolved naturally under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) modifies the initial state by a multiplicative factor that evolves with time, changing the trajectory of the system from what would be produced by the natural evolution under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation f(z) = e^(At)z to the initial condition z_0 at t=0 and letting the system evolve according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\) will result in z(t) at any t > 0 being equivalent to the natural evolution of z_0 under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\). The constant complex matrix A directly influences the transformation f(z), and time t directly affects the state z(t)."
