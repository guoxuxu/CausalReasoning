  "Problem": "Consider the Fourier transform \\\\( F(k) \\\\) of a function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) given by the integral transformation \\\\( F(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-ikx} f(x) dx \\\\). We aim to evaluate how the application of a derivative operator \\\\( D \\\\), defined as \\\\( Df(x) = f'(x) \\\\), influences the Fourier transformed function.\n\nIf the derivative operator \\\\( D \\\\) is applied to \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and then the Fourier transform is computed, will the transformed function \\\\( F(k) \\\\) reflect the effects of differentiation in a straightforward manner corresponding to multiplication by \\\\( -ik \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the derivative operator to \\\\( f(x) \\\\) prior to the Fourier transform leads directly to \\\\( F(k) \\\\) being multiplied by \\\\( -ik \\\\), based on the properties of the Fourier transform of derivatives. Therefore, the Fourier transformation of \\\\( Df(x) \\\\) follows as \\\\( -ik F(k) \\\\).",
