  "Problem": "Consider a closed curve C in the complex plane and a function f(z) which is holomorphic inside and on C, except for isolated singularities inside C. We examine the effect of applying the contour integral transformation \\\\( g(f) = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi i} \\\\int_C f(z) dz \\\\) which computes the residues of the function at its singularities.\n\nCan we determine the original function f(z) and the exact transformation h(f) applied, solely from the knowledge of the outcome of g(f) after the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple transformations and original functions could lead to the same result when the contour integral is applied. Without additional information about the nature of h(f) or the specifics of the original or present function f(z), it's impossible to uniquely determine the precise function and transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
