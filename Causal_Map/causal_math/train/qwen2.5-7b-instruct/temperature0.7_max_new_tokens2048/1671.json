  "Problem": "Consider a system of complex functions where \\\\(z(t)\\\\) evolves over time according to \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz(t)\\\\), with M being a constant complex matrix. We analyze the change when applying a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{iNt}z \\\\), where N is another constant complex matrix and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(z) = e^{-iN't}z \\\\) (where N' is another constant complex matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on M, irrespective of N?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces a new modifying element into the system, consequently making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent not only on M but also on how N and N' interact through their respective transformations. Their collective effects influence the progression and endpoint.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
