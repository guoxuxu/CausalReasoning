  "Problem": "Consider a system represented by the integral transformation \\\\(Y(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} y(t) dt\\\\), where y(t) is a complex function and s is a complex variable. We explore the effects of a differential operator \\\\(D = \\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\) and how it acts on y(t) before and after the transformation.\n\nGiven the final transformed state \\\\(Y'(s)\\\\) after applying \\\\(P\\\\), can we deduce the form of the original function y(t) and whether the intervention \\\\(P\\\\) was specifically used, by solely analyzing \\\\(Y'(s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining both the original y(t) and the specific intervention from \\\\(Y'(s)\\\\) alone is challenging due to potential similarities in transformed outcomes from different initial functions or interventions. The Laplace domain representation obscures specific temporal behaviors and interventions unless additional side information is provided.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
