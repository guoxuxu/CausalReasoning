  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real number and \\( t \\) is time. This function represents a point moving in a circle on the complex plane. We examine the effect of a Fourier transform, defined as \\( \\hat{z}(\\omega') = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty z(t)e^{-i\\omega' t} dt \\), on this function over the frequency domain \\( \\omega' \\).\n\nIf an intervention is made by altering \\( \\omega \\) to \\( \\omega + \\Delta \\) at some \\( t_1 \\), and then applying the Fourier transform, will \\( \\hat{z}(\\omega') \\) only reflect the change at \\( \\omega' = \\omega + \\Delta \\) and not at \\( \\omega \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing \\( \\omega \\) to \\( \\omega + \\Delta \\) effectively shifts the frequency component of \\( z(t) \\). The Fourier transform of the altered signal \\( e^{i(\\omega+\\Delta) t} \\) results in a delta function at \\( \\omega' = \\omega + \\Delta \\), reflecting only the new frequency. The original frequency \\( \\omega \\) will no longer be present unless \\( \\Delta = 0 \\).",
