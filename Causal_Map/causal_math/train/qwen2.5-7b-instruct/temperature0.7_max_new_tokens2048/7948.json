  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), commonly known as the heat equation, where D is a diffusion constant. We investigate the effect of an initial condition transformation given by \\\\( g(u_0) = u_0 + h(x) \\\\), where \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is a function representing a heat source distribution.\n\nGiven the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), can we precisely identify if the initial condition was modified by \\\\( g(u_0) \\\\) and what type of intervention occurred at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), based solely on observing \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final temperature distribution can result from various combinations of initial modifications and interventions. Diffusion processes inherently mask earlier states and influences, making it challenging to isolate and identify specific changes or interventions based solely on the final distribution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition transformation g(u_0) influences the temperature distribution u(x, T). The function h(x) contributes to this transformation. An intervention at t_1 modifies the system."
