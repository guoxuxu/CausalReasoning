  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit where the input voltage \\\\(V_{in}(t)\\\\) is related to the output current \\\\(I(t)\\\\) via a transfer function defined by \\\\( I(t) = K \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{A(s-t)} V_{in}(s) ds \\\\), where K and A are constants.\n\nCan we determine the exact form of \\\\( V_{in}(t) \\\\) at all times t = 0 to T by only measuring \\\\( I(t) \\\\) at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The transfer function involves an integration over time, which means multiple forms of \\\\( V_{in}(t) \\\\) could lead to the same \\\\( I(T) \\\\). This smearing effect prevents the exact determination of \\\\( V_{in}(t) \\\\) from \\\\( I(T) \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
