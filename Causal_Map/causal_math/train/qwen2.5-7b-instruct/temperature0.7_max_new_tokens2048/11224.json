  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. The function describes the evolution of a complex number over time. An integral transformation \\\\( T{[z]} = \\\\int_0^T z(t) dt \\\\) is applied to study the cumulative effect over the interval from 0 to T.\n\nGiven the outcome of \\\\( T{[z]} \\\\), can we determine which interventions were applied (value of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)), and the initial frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), based solely on the transformation result?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation result from \\\\( T{[z]} \\\\), while indicative of frequency characteristics, does not uniquely specify the values of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\). Frequencies can combine in such a way that the cumulative effect might mimic that of different individual frequencies or interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
