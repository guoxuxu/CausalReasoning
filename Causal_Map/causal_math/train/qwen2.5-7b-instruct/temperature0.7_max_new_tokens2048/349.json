  "Problem": "Evaluate the effect of a complex function \\\\( z(s) = e^{s^2} \\\\) on the real function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) when transformed using the Laplace Transform. Let the original system be governed by \\\\( h(t) = t^2 \\\\).\n\nIf the complex function \\\\( z(s) = e^{s^2} \\\\) is applied to the Laplace Transform of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) at s = 0, and the system is then evolved without further intervention, will the inverse Laplace Transform at time T yield the same result as the direct evolution of \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the complex function modifies the transform domain representation of \\\\( h(t) \\\\), hence the resultant time-domain function upon inverse transformation will reflect the effects of this function and will not be identical to the unmodified \\\\( h(t) = t^2 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
