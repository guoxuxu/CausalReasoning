  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}u(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant representing the angular frequency and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is an initially real-valued function. The impact of Laplace transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} = Z(s) \\\\) is studied to understand its transformation properties and the system behavior.\n\nUsing the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) observed, can one distinguish if the original function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) was multiplied by a constant k or if it was an exponential coefficient change in \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "From the transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), distinguishing between a scaling of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and a change in the exponential coefficient within \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) is not feasible without additional information. The change affects the transform in a way that could equally result from modifications to either component, due to properties of the Laplace transform where both alterations can shift the function similarly.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
