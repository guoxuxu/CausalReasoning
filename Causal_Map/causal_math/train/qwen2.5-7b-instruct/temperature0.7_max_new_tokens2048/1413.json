  "Problem": "Consider a system subject to periodic external force, modeled by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + p\\\\dot{x} + qx = f(t)\\\\) where p and q are constants and \\\\(f(t)\\\\) represents the forcing term. We examine the effect of applying a transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(x) = Ax^2 \\\\) to the state x, where A is a constant.\n\nIf the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) is square-transformed by \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under the given differential equation without further intervention, will the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time T be equivalent to evolving \\\\( x_0 \\\\) directly under the same conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The squaring transformation \\\\( g(x) = Ax^2 \\\\) modifies the initial condition, which in turn affects the entire trajectory of the system. Consequently, the trajectory starting from \\\\(Ax_0^2\\\\) will not match the trajectory from \\\\( x_0 \\\\), as the system's behavior is highly sensitive to initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state x_0, when transformed by g(x) = Ax^2 resulting in x^2, and then back-transformed to x, evolves to x(T) under the given differential equation, implying that the square transformation and subsequent back-transformation do not change the final state x(T) at time T."
