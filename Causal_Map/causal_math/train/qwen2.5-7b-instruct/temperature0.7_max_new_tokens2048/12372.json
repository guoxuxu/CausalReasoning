  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_{xx} + u_{yy} = 0 \\\\) over a domain \\\\( D \\\\) with a boundary condition \\\\( u = f \\\\) on \\\\( \\\\partial D \\\\). We examine the result of initial transformations using the eigenfunction expansions of \\\\( u \\\\) and how tool-based interventions like Laplacian solvers act.\n\nIf \\\\( f \\\\) undergoes a Fourier transform before being applied as a boundary condition, then the solution \\\\( u \\\\) develops under natural evolution of the system. Will this transformation impact solutions at any point \\\\( x, y \\\\) within \\\\( D \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Transforming \\\\( f \\\\) by a Fourier transform changes the frequency components of the boundary values. Since the boundary conditions directly influence the solution within \\\\( D \\\\) using eigenfunction expansions, altered frequencies will modify the resultant field of \\\\( u \\\\) throughout the domain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying a Fourier transform to the boundary condition f results in a transformed f, which then influences the solution u within the domain D."
