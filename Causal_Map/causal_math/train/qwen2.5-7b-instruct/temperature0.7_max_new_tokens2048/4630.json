  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = (x(t), y(t)) \\\\) in the complex plane, where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts, respectively. The dynamics of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), with \\\\( M \\\\) being a complex matrix. Analyze the impact of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\), where \\\\( N \\\\) is also a complex matrix.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), it is impossible to accurately trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) because the transformation could have changed the initial state in a complex way that is not reversible solely with knowledge of \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( z(T) \\\\), especially considering the non-commutativity of complex matrices.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of z(t) over time is determined by Mz → dz/dt, and the transformation h(z) = e^(Nt)z changes z to z(T). Knowing z(T) does not allow us to uniquely determine z_0 without information about the application of h(z)."
