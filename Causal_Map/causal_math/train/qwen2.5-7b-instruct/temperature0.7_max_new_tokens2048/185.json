  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) mapping complex numbers, where A is a constant complex matrix. We investigate the behavior of this transformation within the context of complex functions and their developments over time using the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve without further intervention using the Laplace transform, will the final state \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was transformed without \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) alters the initial conditions by transforming \\\\( z_0 \\\\) through the exponential of matrix A, which can significantly change the trajectory in the complex plane. Furthermore, the influence of A on the time evolution affects the final Laplace transformation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the linear transformation f(z0) directly influences the state z(t), and the initial state z0 also directly influences the state z(t). The Laplace transform L{z(t)} of z(t) determines the final state."
