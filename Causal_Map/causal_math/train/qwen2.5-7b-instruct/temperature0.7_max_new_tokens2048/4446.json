  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real and imaginary parts respectively, governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix. We investigate the scenario where the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\) is applied, with N also being a complex matrix.\n\nCan we precisely determine the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if and how \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, determining the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is ambiguous. The transformation \\\\( e^{Nt} \\\\) could have changed the starting point in a non-trivial way correlated with the dynamics governed by M, and reversing that effect without precise knowledge of N's impact is not feasible.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial complex number z(0) directly influences z(T). The differential equation parameter M directly causes changes in z(t). Applying the function h(z) with matrix N transforms z(t) but does not affect the causal relationship between z(0) and z(T) if h(z) is known or can be accounted for."
