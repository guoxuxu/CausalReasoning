  "Problem": "Investigate the system described by the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{at} \\) where \\( a \\) is a complex constant. We apply transformations using the Laplace transform \\( F(s) \\) and study the effect at time \\( t \\).\n\nIf a transformation \\( F(s) \\) is applied to \\( z(0) \\) (i.e., the initial condition is transformed), then \\( z(t) \\) is computed by inverse Laplace transform, will the resulting \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) be the same as computed directly from \\( e^{at} \\) without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Laplace transform alters the original function in the s-domain, and upon performing the inverse Laplace transform, the path of transformation can introduce different components depending on the poles and zeros introduced by \\( F(s) \\). This modified path means \\( z(t) \\) will potentially differ.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition z(0) directly influences z(T). Applying the Laplace transform F(s) to z(0) and then inverse transforming affects z(T), potentially altering its value compared to directly computing z(T) from e^{at}."
