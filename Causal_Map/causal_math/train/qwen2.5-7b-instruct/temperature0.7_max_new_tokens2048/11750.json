  "Problem": "Examine the complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\) where \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) are solutions to the coupled differential equations \\( \\dot{x} = Ax + By \\) and \\( \\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\) respectively. Consider the effect of the linear operator \\( L(z) = e^{Mt}z \\) where M is a constant matrix, applied at different intervals.\n\nIf an intervention by the function \\( K(z) = e^{Nt}z \\) (where N is another constant matrix) is applied at a time \\( t_1 \\), will the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for T > \\( t_1 \\) depend only on the differential equation parameters A, B, C, D and not on M or N?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions with \\( L(z) \\) and \\( K(z) \\) introduce additional factors influencing the trajectory of \\( z(t) \\). The final state \\( z(T) \\) will depend on how M, N influence \\( z \\) as well as the differential equation coefficients, leading to a trajectory potentially different from that dictated solely by the differential equations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
