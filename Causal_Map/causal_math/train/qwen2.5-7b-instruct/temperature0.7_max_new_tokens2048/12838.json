  "Problem": "Consider a system of coupled harmonic oscillators whose state is described by the vector function \\\\(\\\\vec{z}(t)\\\\). The evolution over time is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{\\\\vec{z}} = M\\\\vec{z}\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We investigate the system's behavior under the Fourier transform, defined as \\\\( F(\\\\vec{z})(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\omega t}\\\\vec{z}(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_2 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( G(\\\\vec{z}) = L\\\\vec{z} \\\\) (where L is a different constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( \\\\vec{z}(T) \\\\) for T > t_2 only depend on matrix M and not on the effects of the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The earlier application of the Fourier transform and the subsequent intervention with matrix L both influence the evolution of state \\\\( \\\\vec{z}(T) \\\\). The earlier transformation can have lingering effects that interact with L, thus affecting the trajectory differently compared to an untransformed initial state.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
