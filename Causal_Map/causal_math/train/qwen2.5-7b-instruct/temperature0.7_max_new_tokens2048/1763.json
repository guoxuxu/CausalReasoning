  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real number and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, under the application of the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\). We analyze how interventions by multiplication of a complex exponential factor affect causal inference in this complex waveform scenario.\n\nIf a multiplication by an additional factor \\\\( e^{i\\\\theta t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a real number, is applied at time t = 0 as an intervention, will the outcome in the s-domain depend exclusively on \\\\( w \\\\) without regard to \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the additional factor \\\\( e^{i\\\\theta t} \\\\) changes the waveform to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i(w+\\\\theta)t} \\\\), and consequently, after the Laplace Transform, to \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z(t)) = \\\\frac{1}{s-i(w+\\\\theta)} \\\\). The outcome clearly depends on both \\\\( w \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\), reflecting the additive effect of the frequencies.",
