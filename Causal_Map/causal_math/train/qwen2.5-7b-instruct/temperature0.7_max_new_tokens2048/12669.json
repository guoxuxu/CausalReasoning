  "Problem": "Consider a continuous-time system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. The effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), to the initial condition \\\\(u_0\\\\) of \\\\(u(t,x)\\\\), followed by its evolution in time is analyzed.\n\nGiven the state \\\\(u(t,x)\\\\) at some time t, can we uniquely determine the initial condition \\\\(u_0\\\\) if we do not know whether a Fourier transform was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the initial application of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), any effects seen at time t in the system may arise from either a transformed or non-transformed initial state. The Fourier transform fundamentally alters the spectral composition of the initial condition, making reconstruction ambiguous without this crucial information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
