  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = re^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( r \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are constants, representing the amplitude and angular frequency respectively. For analysis, a transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^T z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\) is used, representing a Fourier transform component.\n\nKnowing only the result of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at time T, can we determine whether the intervention \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied, and if so, the values of \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform component extracted by \\\\( f(z) \\\\) integrates contributions over the period and does not retain specific time-local information about when or how interventions occurred. Therefore, it is impossible to deduce the exact nature of the intervention or its parameters solely from the value of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at time T.",
