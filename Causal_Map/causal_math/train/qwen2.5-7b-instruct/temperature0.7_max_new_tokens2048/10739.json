  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation on a vector space using a matrix M and its exponential \\\\(e^{Mt}\\\\) which acts on vectors in the space. We investigate the effects of initial transformations \\\\(f(x) = e^{Nt}x\\\\), where N is another matrix, on the temporal evolution of vectors.\n\nIf an intervention using a transformation \\\\(g(x) = e^{Lt}x\\\\) (where L is another constant matrix) is applied at a time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the final state of the vector at T, \\\\(x(T)\\\\), be affected by earlier transformations (N) or solely depend on M and L?",
  "Explanation": "The trajectory and therefore the final state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) will be influenced not just by M and L but also N. The interactions among these transformations can compound over time and result in a different outcome, showing dependence on the sequence and type of transformations applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The final state of the vector x(T) depends on both the initial transformation defined by N through f(x) and the intervening transformation defined by L through g(x). The transformations e^{Mt} and e^{Lt} evolve the vector over time based on the matrices M and L respectively."
