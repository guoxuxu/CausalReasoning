  "Problem": "Imagine a system modeled by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is a complex function of time. We evaluate the impact of applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf at t = T_1 an intervention happens by applying a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is another complex constant), will the state of the system at T > T_1 depend only on \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention at T_1 superimposes an additional complex exponential, thereby making the final state z(T) for T > T_1 dependent on both \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) as well as \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\). This overlapping of transformations affects the solution trajectory and the system's final state.",
