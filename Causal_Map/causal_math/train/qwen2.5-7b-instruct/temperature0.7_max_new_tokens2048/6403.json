  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit governed by the differential equation \\\\(L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t)\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is inductance, \\\\(R\\\\) is resistance, and \\\\(V(t)\\\\) is a time-varying voltage source. Analyze the effect of applying a linear time-invariant system transformation characterized by the impulse response function \\\\(h(t) = e^{-\\\\alpha t}\\\\) for \\\\(t \\\\geq 0\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf an intervention in the form of a sudden change in resistance \\\\(R\\\\) to a new value \\\\(R'\\\\) occurs at some time \\\\(t_1\\\\) < T, will the final current \\\\(I(T)\\\\) depend solely on the initial set up without taking into account the transformation \\\\(h(t)\\\\)'s effect on \\\\(V(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The change in resistance \\\\(R'\\\\) as an intervention affects how the transformed input voltage influences the system response. Thus, the final current \\\\(I(T)\\\\) depends on both the nature of the transformation \\\\(h(t)\\\\) applied to \\\\(V(t)\\\\) and the subsequent change in resistance, not solely on the original system configuration.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Resistance R and inductance L directly cause current I; voltage V(t) directly causes current I; impulse response function h(t) indirectly affects voltage V(t), which then affects current I; a sudden change in resistance R to R' at time t1 causes current I."
