  "Problem": "Consider a complex plane wherein a transformation \\\\( z \\\\to e^{kt} z \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( f(z) \\\\), where k is a complex constant. Analyze the transformation's effect on the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\) around a closed contour C.\n\nGiven the value of the integral at time \\\\( T \\\\) as \\\\( \\\\int_C f(e^{kT} z) \\\\, dz \\\\), can you determine the initial function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) without knowing the transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the transformation, interpreting the integration result back to the original function is ambiguous because multiple functions can yield the same transformed integral, owing to complex contour changes and the parameters of k.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The value of the complex constant kT directly causes the transformation e^(kT), which directly causes the function to be evaluated at e^(kT)z. The time T directly causes the integral of the transformed function around the closed contour C."
