  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the equation of motion is derived from the Hamiltonian \\\\( H = \\\\frac{p^2}{2m} + v(x) \\\\), where \\\\( p \\\\) is momentum, \\\\( m \\\\) is mass, and \\\\( v(x) \\\\) is a potential energy function. We analyze the effects of applying a Fourier Transform, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), to the position function \\\\( x(t) \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a transformation \\\\( g(x) = x + \\\\delta x \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\delta x \\\\) is a small perturbation) is applied as an intervention, will the waveform \\\\( X(\\\\omega, T) \\\\) at \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend on the initial Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(x(0)) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the state of the system by a definable perturbation \\\\( \\\\delta x \\\\), affecting the trajectory and consequently the state at any time T. Thus, the Fourier Transform at time T will depend both on the initial conditions and the intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying a small perturbation g(x) → x(t) changes the position over time, which in turn affects the velocity x(t) → v(x), the Hamiltonian x(t) → H, and ultimately the Fourier transform X(ω, T) at later times T > t1. The initial Fourier transform F(x(0)) also influences X(ω, T)."
