  "Problem": "Consider a complex analysis problem where the function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) is transformed using an integral along a contour \\\\( C \\\\). The contour \\\\( C \\\\) is specified to be the unit circle in the complex plane. Assume that the variable transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied to modify the path of integration.\n\nBased on the observed outcome of the integral after transformations \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( i(z) \\\\), can we conclusively determine which transformations were applied, only by knowing the integral's final value?",
  "Explanation": "The final integral value can result from various combinations or forms of transformations due to the wide-ranging effects transformations can have on the integration path and function values. Without explicit knowledge of the transformations' specifics, especially in complex analysis, it's unfeasible to reverse-engineer accurately which transformation led to the observed outcome. Multiple transformation sequences could result in identical or similar final valuations, reducing identifiability.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The function g(z) influences the initial integral, the contour C specifies the path of the initial integral, the transformation h(z) modifies the path of integration resulting in a new integral, and the transformation i(z) further modifies the path leading to another integral."
