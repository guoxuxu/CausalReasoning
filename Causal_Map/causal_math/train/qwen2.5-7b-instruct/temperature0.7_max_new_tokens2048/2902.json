  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We also define a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant and t represents time.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The exponential growth or decay introduced by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) in the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) complicates direct inference of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Without knowing the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), computating back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) would involve ambiguity in the extracted phase and magnitude due to the unknown influence of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "ω → d/dt z(t); α → h(z); t → z(t); t → h(z); z(0) → z(t); T → z(T)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of z with respect to time is directly influenced by ω; α transforms z through time; time t determines the state of z and h(z); the initial value of z at t=0 influences its state at any time t; the observation of z at time T allows deduction of z(0) if no transformation h(z) was applied."
