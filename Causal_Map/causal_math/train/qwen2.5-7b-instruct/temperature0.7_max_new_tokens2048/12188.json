  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t is time and i is the imaginary unit. We evaluate the impact of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-i} \\\\), which transforms the complex exponential function into a function of a complex variable s.\n\nIf the Laplace transform is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and then the resulting function \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-i} \\\\) is allowed to determine the behavior over a period T without further modification, will the inverse Laplace transform at time T recover the original function \\\\( z(T) = e^{iT} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform is a bijective transformation for this class of functions, meaning that applying the Laplace transform and subsequently its inverse will recover the original function \\\\( z(T) = e^{iT} \\\\), assuming no modifications are done to the transformed function.",
