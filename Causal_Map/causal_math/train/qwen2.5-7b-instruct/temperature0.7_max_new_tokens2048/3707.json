  "Problem": "Examine the effect of a Laplace transform on a continuous function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) that is subjected to the operator \\\\( L[g(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}g(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number. Analyze scenarios where an additional transformation \\\\( h(t) = t^2 g(t) \\\\) is applied.\n\nIf an intervention of multiplying \\\\( g(t) \\\\) with \\\\( t^2 \\\\) (applying \\\\( h(t) \\\\)) is done at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\) before taking \\\\( L[g(t)] \\\\), does the resulting Laplace transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\) reflect only the original characteristics of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) or the intervention as well?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) results in \\\\( H(s) \\\\), which is indeed different from \\\\( G(s) \\\\) because it integrates the effects of the intervening multiplication by \\\\( t^2 \\\\). This intervention changes the output significantly, as the transform of \\\\( t^2g(t) \\\\) rather than just \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is evaluated.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Multiplying g(t) with t^2 to form h(t) changes the function before applying the Laplace transform; thus, the resulting Laplace transform H(s) reflects both the original characteristics of g(t) and the effect of the intervention (multiplication by t^2)."
