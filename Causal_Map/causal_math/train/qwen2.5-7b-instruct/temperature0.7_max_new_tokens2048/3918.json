  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) applied in a calculus context on a closed contour \\\\( C \\\\) in the complex plane. We analyze the impact of various transformations and integrations of the function over the contour.\n\nGiven an integral result of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) over contour \\\\( C \\\\), can we determine the original function applied if it is known no transformations occurred?",
  "Explanation": "The integral result alone may suggest different possible functions due to the nature of contour integrals in complex analysis. Without additional information about the properties of the function (or its absence), several functions could theoretically yield the same integral value over that contour.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
