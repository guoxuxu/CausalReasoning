  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a positive constant. We examine the effect of a Fourier transform intervention \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-ikx} u(x, t) \\\\, dx\\\\).\n\nKnowing the transformed state \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\), can we exactly pinpoint whether just the heat equation, the Fourier transform, or both influenced the observed state?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform's effect on the frequency domain melds with the diffusive effects of the heat equation in a way that can make it difficult to disentangle one influence from the other. The final state \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) might derive from several combinations of initial conditions and transformations, leading to ambiguities in causal inference.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
