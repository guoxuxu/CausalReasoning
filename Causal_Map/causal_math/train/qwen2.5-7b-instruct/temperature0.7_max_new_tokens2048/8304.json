  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( x \\\\), with \\\\( A \\\\) being a real number representing a rotational frequency in the complex plane. The behavior over time is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\). We explore the impact of the transformation function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\) where \\\\( B \\\\) is another real number.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can the precise interventions used (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) be determined merely by knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can potentially be arrived at through different combinations or timings of the interventions due to the cumulative phase adjustments by \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\). The non-unique possibilities in rotational shifts hinder the ability to ascertain precisely which interventions were applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The rotational frequency A determines the rate of change of z, B determines the transformation of z, and the state at time T depends on the transformations applied to z."
