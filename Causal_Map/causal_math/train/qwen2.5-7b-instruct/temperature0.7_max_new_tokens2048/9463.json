  "Problem": "Consider the complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. The effect of the integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) is analyzed over time interval [0, T].\n\nIf a phase shift \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is introduced to the function at \\\\( t = t_1 \\\\) so that the function becomes \\\\( z(t) = e^{iA(t-t_1) + \\\\alpha} \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\), will the final output of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) from t = 0 to T only depend on the original value of A?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing a phase shift modifies the phase part of the complex exponential in the function from the point of intervention, thereby affecting the outcome of the integral from t = t_1 to T. Therefore, both \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) influence the final result.",
