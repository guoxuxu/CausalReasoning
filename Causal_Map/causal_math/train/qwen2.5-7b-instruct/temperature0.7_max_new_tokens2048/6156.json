  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations modeled by a matrix equation \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a matrix and \\\\(b\\\\) is a vector. We study the system's behavior under a transformation \\\\(x(t) = e^{Ct}x\\\\), where \\\\(C\\\\) is another constant matrix, and how interventions using matrix \\\\(D\\\\) affect the solution.\n\nWith the final observed state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) and the knowledge of \\\\(Ax(T) = b\\\\), is it possible to unequivocally determine which transformations were applied (\\(e^{Ct}x\\\\) or \\(e^{Dt}x\\\\), or both) across the timeline?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the compounded nature of exponential matrix transformations and the variable properties of matrices \\\\(C\\\\) and \\\\(D\\\\), it's unfeasible to deduce definitively which transformations were applied just from knowing the outcome \\\\(x(T)\\\\). Different sequences of these transformations could yield the same final state, making it indeterminate from the endpoint alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation e^(Ct)x directly influences the state x(T). The matrix A transforms the state x to Ax, and the vector b represents the transformed state. Different matrices C and D applied to x at time t yield different states e^(Ct)x and e^(Dt)x respectively, which can be observed at time T."
