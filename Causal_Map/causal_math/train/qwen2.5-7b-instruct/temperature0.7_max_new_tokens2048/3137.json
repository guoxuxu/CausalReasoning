  "Problem": "Suppose we have a complex function \\\\( z = g(w) = e^{i\\\\omega t}w \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. This function is used to modify the initial conditions of a particle's state in a quantum system described by \\\\( \\psi(t) = U(t)\\psi_0 \\\\), where \\\\( U(t) \\\\) is a unitary time evolution operator.\n\nIf the function \\\\( g(w) \\\\) is initially applied to the state \\\\( \\psi_0 \\\\) and the system evolves according to \\\\( \\psi(t) = U(t)\\psi_0 \\\\) after this application, will the final state \\\\( \\psi(T) \\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\( \\psi_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to T under \\\\( U(t) \\\\) without applying \\\\( g(w) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\\\( g(w) = e^{i\\\\omega t}w \\\\) modifies the initial state by adding a phase factor. Even though \\\\( U(t) \\\\) is unitary and preserves the norm, the additional phase factor introduced by \\\\( g(w) \\\\) results in a different quantum state at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the function g(w) to the initial state ψ_0 before evolving it with U(t) leads to a different state ψ(t) which, at time T, results in ψ(T). Without applying g(w) to ψ_0, the state directly evolves to ψ(T) under U(t)."
