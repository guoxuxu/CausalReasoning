  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) representing a time-varying signal, and its Fourier Transform (FT) as \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\). We investigate the impact of two operations: multiplication by a real exponential \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\) and differentiation with respect to time \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\).\n\nIf the signal is first transformed to \\\\( z'(t) = e^{-at}z(t) \\\\), and then differentiated with respect to time, will the Fourier Transform of this derivative depend solely on the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), and not on the decaying factor \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The differentiation of \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) introduces additional modifications in both the amplitude and phase within the Fourier Transform. The derivative operation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\) amplifies the frequency component by \\\\( i\\\\omega - a \\\\), making the result dependent not only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) but also on the decay parameter \\\\( a \\\\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "Multiplying the signal z(t) by a real exponential e^{-at} results in a new signal z'(t), which when differentiated yields z'', where the Fourier Transform of z'' depends on the original frequency ω but not on the decaying factor a."
