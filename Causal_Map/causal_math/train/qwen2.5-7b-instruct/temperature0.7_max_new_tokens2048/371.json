  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We assess the effects of applying the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-ikx} u(x, t) dx \\\\) which changes the domain from spatial coordinates x to wave numbers k.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a modification by operator M (\\\\( v(t_1) = Mu(t_1) \\\\)) is applied in the physical domain, will the resultant \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on L and not M?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with operator M modifies the state mechanically, affecting the subsequent evolution in the frequency domain once transformed. Therefore, both operators L and M influence the final state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\), and the trajectory is dependent on the physical properties imposed by M.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of u(x, t) over time is governed by L, and the Fourier transform converts this to \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t)\\\\). Applying M at t_1 modifies u(x, t_1) to v(t_1), but the subsequent evolution of \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depends only on L and the initial state before modification."
