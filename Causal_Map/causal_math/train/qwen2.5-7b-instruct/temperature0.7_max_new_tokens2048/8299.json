  "Problem": "Analyze the impact of a contour integral transformation on a complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) by proposing the transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_C e^{zt} dz \\\\), where C is a closed contour around the origin and t is a real-parameter.\n\nIf a further transformation \\\\( U(z) = \\\\int_D e^{sz} dz \\\\) (where D is another contour and s is a different real parameter) is applied sequentially after \\\\( T(z) \\\\), does the final result only depend on the shape of \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final outcome now depends on both transformations, \\\\( T(z) \\\\) and \\\\( U(z) \\\\), involving the parameters t and s as well as the contours C and D. The multiple influences from these factors extend beyond merely the original function form, impacting the overall result significantly through the integrative transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation T(z) depends on the contour C and the parameter t; the transformation U(z) depends on the contour D and the parameter s. The final result of applying U(z) after T(z) depends on both T(z) and U(z), which in turn depend on their respective contours and parameters."
