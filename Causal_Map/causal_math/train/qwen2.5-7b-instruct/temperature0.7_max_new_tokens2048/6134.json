  "Problem": "Investigate a vector field governed by a linear transformation and its potential modification by another function defined as \\( h(x) = \\int e^{Mt} dt \\cdot x \\), where M is a constant matrix. The original vector function is defined by \\( \\dot{x} = Lx \\), for a constant matrix L.\n\nAfter observing \\( x(t) \\) at t = T, can we identify the original vector \\( x_0 \\) at t = 0 without knowing whether \\( h(x) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on the application of \\( h(x) \\), the effect of \\( \\int e^{Mt} dt \\cdot x \\) on \\( x_0 \\) is indeterminate and may lead to multiple possible initial vectors \\( x_0 \\) depending on how M influences the trajectory through its interaction with L. Thus, tracing back to \\( x_0 \\) uniquely is not feasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The original vector field Lx directly influences the state x(t) at time t; the function h(x) modifies the state x(t); the initial state x(0) determines the state x(t) after applying the transformation."
