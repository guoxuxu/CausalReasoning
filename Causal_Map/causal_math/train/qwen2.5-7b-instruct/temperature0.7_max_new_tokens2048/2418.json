  "Problem": "Examine a control system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu + p\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator and \\\\(p\\\\) is a control function. The system's transformation is analyzed using the Laplace transform, defined as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(u(t)) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}u(t)\\\\, dt\\\\).\n\nCan we infer the exact time-profile of \\\\( p(t) \\\\) from the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(u(t))\\\\) without other system details?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform, being an integral transform, generally loses certain time-specific information about the function it transforms, such as localized variations in p(t). Without additional conditions or data about the operator L or initial conditions, reconstructing p(t) from \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(u(t))\\\\) is not feasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The control function p directly influences the rate of change of u with respect to time (L → ∂u/∂t), and the Laplace transform of u(t) is related to the rate of change of u with respect to time (∂u/∂t → mathcal{L}(u(t))). However, without additional system details, we cannot infer the exact time-profile of p(t) solely from mathcal{L}(u(t))."
