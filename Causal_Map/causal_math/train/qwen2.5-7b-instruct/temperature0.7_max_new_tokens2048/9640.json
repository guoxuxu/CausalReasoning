  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) defined over complex numbers \\\\( z \\\\). We examine the impact of an integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-tz} dt \\\\) applied to \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nBased on the final result of \\\\( g(h(f(z_0))) \\\\), can we determine the exact sequence and types of transformations (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both in some order) applied?",
  "Explanation": "The final result of such a compound transformation involving exponentials and integrals generally won’t explicitly discriminate between the sequence or specific applications of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\). Multiple transformation sequences could result in similar outcomes, especially in complex functions and integral transformations where inversion may not be straightforward.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function f(z) = z^2 is transformed by g(z) = ∫_{0}^{∞} e^{-tz} dt to produce g(h(f(z))), and h(f(z)) represents the sequence of applying h after f."
