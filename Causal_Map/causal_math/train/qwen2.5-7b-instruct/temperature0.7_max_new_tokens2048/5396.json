  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\nabla^2 u\\\\) representing wave propagation, where c is the wave speed. We explore the effect of introducing a Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) \\\\) to convert the spatial variable into the frequency domain.\n\nGiven the wave's state at time T in the frequency domain, can we distinguish whether intermediate Fourier transformations were applied and reversed during the evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Since the application and immediate reversal of a Fourier transformation leave no trace on the wave function (due to the properties of Fourier transforms), it is impossible to determine from the final state alone whether such interventions took place.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Fourier transform F(u) to the wave u converts it to the frequency domain, and the wave's state at time T in the frequency domain (wave_state_T) depends on the application of F(u). Reversing the Fourier transformation would return the wave from the frequency domain back to its spatial representation."
