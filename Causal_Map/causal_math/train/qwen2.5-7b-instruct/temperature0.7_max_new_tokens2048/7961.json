  "Problem": "Analyze the effects of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(g(x)) \\\\) on a function \\\\( g(x) \\\\), which is subsequently evolved via Laplace transform \\\\( L(h(t)) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} h(t) dt \\\\) over time variable t.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( F(g(x)) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and the resulting function is then processed by the Laplace transform without any further transformation, will the final outcome still be interpretable solely in terms of the original \\\\( g(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform changes the domain and characteristics of \\\\( g(x) \\\\) from time/spatial domain to frequency domain, significantly altering its properties. Applying the Laplace transform to this altered state integrates these new characteristics over a different complex domain, resulting in a final transform that cannot be solely understood just by looking at the original \\\\( g(x) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Fourier transform of g(x) results in a new function, which when Laplace transformed, yields a representation that depends on the original g(x) through its Fourier transform."
