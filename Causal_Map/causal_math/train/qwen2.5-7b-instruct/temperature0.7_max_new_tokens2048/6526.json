  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of t. The Laplace Transform of z is defined as \\\\( L(z)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\). Consider the impact of the differential operator D on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) represented as \\\\( Dz(t) = z'(t) \\\\) and its effect on the transformed function.\n\nGiven \\\\( L(Dz)(s) \\\\) in the s-domain, can we uniquely determine \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without knowing \\\\( z(0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed domain function \\\\( L(Dz)(s) \\\\) depends on the initial condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\). Without knowledge of \\\\( z(0) \\\\), it is impossible to accurately compute or infer the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), as the initial value directly affects the inversion of the Laplace Transform.",
