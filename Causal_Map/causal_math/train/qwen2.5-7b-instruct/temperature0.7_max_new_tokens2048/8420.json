  "Problem": "Examine the linear system driven by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = Mx(t)\\\\), where \\\\(M\\\\) is a constant coefficient matrix. Consider the complex function transformation \\\\(h(x) = S \\\\exp(i\\\\omega t)x\\\\), where \\\\(S\\\\) is another constant matrix and \\\\(i\\\\) represents the imaginary unit.\n\nBy analyzing the state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) alone, can we decisively conclude which transformations (either \\\\(h(x)\\\\), \\\\(k(x)\\\\), or both) were applied, based solely on the final observed state without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) could result from various combinations of the prior transformations and the inherent system dynamics. The non-uniqueness of the solutions to the matrix exponential functions in combination with different possible initial states and interventions makes it impossible to definitively backtrack and identify the specific transformations applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
