  "Problem": "Let \\\\( z(t) \\\\) represent a complex function governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a real constant. Consider the effect of applying the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), and then exploring the causal relationships between different transformations applied to \\\\( z \\\\) at various times.\n\nIf the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) is initially applied to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, forming \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), and then the time evolution is traced without further intervention, will the time domain representation at time T mimic the original evolution without the Laplace transform?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform is a linear operation that does not alter the inherent dynamics of the function, so transforming \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) back to the time domain will yield the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), evolving as \\\\( e^{i \\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\). The behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any time T remains consistent with its initial specification.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The complex function z(t) changes over time according to its derivative, and when Laplace transformed at t=0, it results in Z(s). Tracing the system's evolution without further intervention means that at time T, z(T) in the time domain will mimic the original evolution without the Laplace transform."
