  "Problem": "Analyzing a system governed by a set of differential equations, \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz + Nu\\\\), where M and N are constant matrices, and \\(u\\) represents an external control input related via the transformation \\\\(u(t) = D(t)z + E(t)\\) where D and E are matrix functions of time.\n\nIf at time \\(t_1\\), the transformation function for \\(u(t)\\) is modified to \\(u(t) = G(t)z + H(t)\\) where G and H are new time-varying matrix functions, will the state \\(z(T)\\) for T > \\(t_1\\) depend solely on M and the original transformation matrices D and E?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention with transformation function \\(G(t)z + H(t)\\) alters the external control input and, consequently, the dynamics of \\(z(t)\\). Thus, \\(z(T)\\) will also be influenced by G and H, in addition to the ongoing effects of M, making the state sensitive to the changes introduced post \\(t_1\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state z(T) for T > t1 depends on M through its effect on \\(\\dot{z}\\), and indirectly on the original transformation matrices D and E through their influence on u(t). Additionally, it depends on the new transformation matrices G and H through their influence on u(t)."
