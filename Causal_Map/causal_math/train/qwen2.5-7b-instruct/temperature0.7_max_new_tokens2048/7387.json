  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\omega z} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. We examine the effect of the Laplace transform, defined as \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\), applied to this function over variable \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( \\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\omega + \\delta \\\\) at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\), for all \\\\( t > t_0 \\\\), and the Laplace transform is applied thereafter, will the resulting transform function be independent of the original \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The modification changes the behavior of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t > t_0 \\\\), resulting in a piecewise function whose transform depends both on the original \\\\( \\omega \\\\) before \\\\( t_0 \\\\) and the adjusted \\\\( \\omega + \\delta \\\\) after. Therefore, the transform will reflect characteristics of both.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Changing omega to omega + delta after time t0 affects the Laplace transform of g(z), making the resulting transform function dependent on the original omega."
