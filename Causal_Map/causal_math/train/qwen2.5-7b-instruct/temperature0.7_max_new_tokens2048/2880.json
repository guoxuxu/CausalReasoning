  "Problem": "Consider the role of a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real functions representing the position of a particle in a two-dimensional space. This function is subjected to a transformation using a Fourier transform, defined by \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\). We study the impact of this transformation and potential interventions on the system.\n\nGiven the modified spectrum \\\\( H(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\), can we determine exactly what the original function was, and the specific nature of the intervention applied?",
  "Explanation": "Determining both the exact original function and the specifics of the intervention (e.g., the value of \\\\( K \\\\) applied) only from the modified spectrum \\\\( H(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) is highly challenging without additional constraints or information. Multiple combinations of original functions and values of \\\\( K \\\\) could produce the same altered spectrum, leading to non-uniqueness in the solution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
