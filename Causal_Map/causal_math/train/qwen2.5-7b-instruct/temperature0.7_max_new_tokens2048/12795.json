  "Problem": "Imagine a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We explore the effects of a transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\), where N is also a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine what interventions were utilized (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), solely based on the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the non-commutative nature of matrix exponentials in the transformations \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and potential overlapping effects, it's impossible to conclusively determine the sequence or types of interventions based on the endpoint alone. This stems from multiple combinations of N and Q possibly leading to the same final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z(T) is caused by the initial condition z(0), the differential equation parameter M, and the transformation parameters N for the function f(z). It may also be influenced by the parameters of another transformation g(z), but without additional information, it's unclear if g(z) played a role."
