  "Problem": "Examine a complex valued function described by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where A is a real constant, and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number. We explore the effects of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), where B is another real constant.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine what transformations were used (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) just by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of parameters B and C can lead to the same final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) due to the nature of exponential rotations in the complex plane. The final observed state could be achieved through various sequences of transformations, complicating the identification of specific interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
