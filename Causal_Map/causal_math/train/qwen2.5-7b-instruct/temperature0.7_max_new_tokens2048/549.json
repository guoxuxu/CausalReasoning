  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex number. We explore the effect of a linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = cz \\\\) where \\\\( c \\\\) is a non-zero complex constant and determine how this affects the evolution of the function over time.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T(z) = cz \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\) without further intervention, will the resulting \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T be proportional to what would be obtained if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was evolved directly to T under \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = cz \\\\) simply scales the initial condition. The function \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\) being exponential and the transformation being linear, \\\\( z(T) = c e^{aT}z_0 \\\\) indeed represents the scaled version of the direct evolution \\\\( c z(T) \\\\). Both trajectories maintain a proportional relationship at any time T.",
