  "Problem": "Consider the complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. The effect of the integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) is analyzed over time interval [0, T].\n\nKnowing only the output of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) over [0, T], can we determine if a phase shift intervention happened, and what the value of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) was?",
  "Explanation": "The result of the integral provides a single complex number without revealing the specific internal changes such as phase shifts made to the function over the interval. There may be multiple combinations of A and \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) producing the same outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
