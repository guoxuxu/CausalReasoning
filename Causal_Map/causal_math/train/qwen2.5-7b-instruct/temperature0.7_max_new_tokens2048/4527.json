  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation in two dimensions \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 \\phi = 0\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\phi(x, y)\\\\) is a scalar potential field. We explore the effects of a transformation defined by \\\\(g(\\\\phi) = \\\\phi + \\\\sin(x + y)\\\\) introduced at a specific location in the domain.\n\nIf an intervention is made by applying a different transformation \\\\(h(\\\\phi) = \\\\phi * \\\\cos(x - y)\\\\) at a different point or time, will the final expression of \\\\(\\\\phi(x, y)\\\\) only depend on the original Laplace’s condition and not the specifics of interventions?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of another transformation modifies the potential field in a new way, particularly multiplying by \\\\(\\\\cos(x - y)\\\\), which itself is not generally a solution to the Laplace equation. This will result in a final potential field that depends on both the form of the original potential and the specific interventions employed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Interventions through g(φ) and h(φ) directly modify φ, but the final expression of φ(x, y) still primarily depends on the original Laplace's condition."
