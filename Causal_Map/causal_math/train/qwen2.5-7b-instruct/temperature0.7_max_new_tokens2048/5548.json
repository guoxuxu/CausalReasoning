  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\} = F(s) \\\\). We examine the effects of the convolution operation using a kernel \\\\( k(t) \\\\) with its transform \\\\( K(s) \\\\), on the system function \\\\( f(t) \\\\).\n\nCan we precisely determine what convolutions (with \\\\( k(t) \\\\) or \\\\( k_1(t) \\\\), or both) were applied by observing the output at time t = T, assuming different kernels could have been used?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple convolution operations and their corresponding outcomes can result in similar outputs at t = T. Diverse kernels can affect the trajectories in non-unique ways, thus we cannot determine precisely the history and type of convolutions just by observing the output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
