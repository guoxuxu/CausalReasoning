  "Problem": "Examine the impact of a change in the variable s defined by the integral transformation \\\\( I(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)dt \\\\) on the function \\\\( f(t) = t^ke^{At} \\\\), where k is a non-negative integer and A is a non-zero constant.\n\nIf an intervention shifts \\\\( k \\\\) to \\\\( k+1 \\\\) at some t = t_1, will the final expression of \\\\( I(s) \\\\) depend solely on the original function parameters and not on the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the integral's integrand by increasing the power of t, which affects all subsequent calculations of the integral from t_1, hence influencing the entire form and convergence properties of \\\\( I(s) \\\\), thereby making it dependent not only on original parameters but also on the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Increasing k by 1 at t = t_1 will affect I(s) because k influences the form of f(t), which in turn changes the integral I(s). t_1 does not have a direct causal link to I(s) since I(s) integrates over all t from 0 to ∞."
