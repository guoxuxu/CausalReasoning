  "Problem": "Assume a system of linear equations modeled by the matrix equation \\\\( Ax = b \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and b is a constant vector. We investigate the effects of an integral transformation defined by the function \\\\( T(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At}x dt \\\\).\n\nAfter observing the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine the initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( T(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( T(x) \\\\), it's impossible to uniquely backtrack to \\\\( x_0 \\\\) because the transformation could have significantly altered the trajectory and final conditions, which an unaltered system \\\\( Ax = b \\\\) would not predict.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
