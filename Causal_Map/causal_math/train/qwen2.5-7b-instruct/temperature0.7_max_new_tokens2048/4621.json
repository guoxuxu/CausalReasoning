  "Problem": "Consider an integral transform scenario where \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(t-s)} x(s) ds \\\\) and A is a constant matrix. The function \\\\( x(s) = e^{Bs}y \\\\), where B is another constant matrix and y is a constant vector, is applied to the system, and we are interested in understanding its effects at time T.\n\nDoes the initial application of \\\\( x(s) = e^{Bs}y \\\\) determine the state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) entirely, assuming no changes are made to the matrices A and B after initial set-up?",
  "Explanation": "The initial setup with \\\\( x(s) = e^{Bs}y \\\\) fully determines the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) through the integral transform, where dependencies are explicitly set by B influencing the evolution of x over time and thus directly impacting the output through A. There is a deterministic path from setup to output in this linear time-invariant system.",
