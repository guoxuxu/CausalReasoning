  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) governed by the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\) where D is a diffusion constant. We are interested in the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) before the system evolves.\n\nIf an additional transformation, say a Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) during the evolution, will the final state \\\\( \\\\widetilde{u}(s, T) \\\\) at T > t_1 be influenced by the initial Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the Fourier transform initially and subsequently the Laplace transform affects how the diffusion process and transformations interact. Each transformation modifies the system's state in its specific manner, thus both will influence the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial Fourier transform influences the evolution of u(x, t), which then determines the final state u(x, T) at any time T. Applying a Laplace transform at time t_1 further modifies u(x, t) before reaching the final state u(x, T)."
