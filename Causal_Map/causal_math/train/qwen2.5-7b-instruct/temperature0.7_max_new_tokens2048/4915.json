  "Problem": "Consider the behaviour of the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\in \\mathbb{R} \\\\), under the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\\\). Analyze how transformations affect causality in the complex function mapping and their implications on the frequency domain.\n\nIf an intervention by scaling \\\\( z(t) \\\\) with a factor \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant, is applied at a time \\\\( t_0 \\\\), will the Laplace Transform output at any \\\\( s \\\\) solely depend on the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) regardless of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Scaling \\\\( z(t) \\\\) with \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) alters the function to \\\\( e^{(\\\\alpha+i\\\\omega) t} \\\\). The Laplace Transform of this new function, \\\\( \\mathcal{L}[z](s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-(\\\\alpha+i\\\\omega)} \\\\), clearly depends on both \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Thus, the output at any \\\\( s \\\\) will reflect contributions from both the scaling intervention and the original frequency.",
