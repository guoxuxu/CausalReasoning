  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) governed by the Cauchy-Riemann equations, and an integral transformation \\( T(z) = \\int_{0}^{t} e^{-st} z(s) \\, ds \\) where \\( s \\) is a complex parameter.\n\nIf a transformation \\( T(z) \\) is applied to a function \\( z_0(t) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\), and then the function is allowed to evolve under the Cauchy-Riemann equations without further intervention, will \\( T(z(t)) \\) at \\( t = T \\) be the same as if \\( z_0(t) \\) was directly transformed to \\( t = T \\) under \\( T(z) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( T(z) \\) integrates \\( z(t) \\) over time with a factor \\( e^{-st} \\), which alters the original function's trajectory. Since the integration and the exponential factor add non-trivial contributions, the outcome at \\( t = T \\) will differ from a direct transformation under \\( T(z) \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function z(t) evolves according to the Cauchy-Riemann equations, which transform z_0(t) into z(t). Applying the transformation T to z(t) at time t yields T(z(t)), while applying T directly to z_0(t) at time T results in T(z_0(T)). The equality of T(z(t)) at t=T and T(z_0(T)) depends on the specific evolution of z(t) under the Cauchy-Riemann equations."
