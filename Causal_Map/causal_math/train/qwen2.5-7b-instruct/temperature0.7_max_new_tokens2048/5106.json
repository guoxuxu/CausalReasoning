  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of an electrical system characterized by the function \\\\( V(t) = V_0 e^{st} \\\\), where \\\\( V_0 \\\\) is the initial voltage and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number. Let \\\\( T(V) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty V(t) e^{-st} dt \\\\) describe a Laplace transformation of the voltage signal over time.\n\nCan we determine the original value of \\\\( s \\\\) from the transformed signal \\\\( T(V) \\\\) without knowing if there was any initial perturbation?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting transformation \\\\( T(V) \\\\) may correspond to multiple values of \\\\( s \\\\), especially if the perturbation was small but significant. Since Laplace transform is not always one-to-one without additional information on signal constraints (like time-boundedness), multiple such \\\\( s \\\\) can yield similar transforms.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
