  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution u(x,t) across a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), with k being the thermal diffusivity constant. We analyze the impact of an integral transformation \\\\( g(u) = \\\\int_0^L e^{-ax} u(x,t) dx \\\\), where a is a constant and L is the length of the rod.\n\nIf \\\\( g(u) \\\\) is calculated at time t = 0 and then the system evolves according to the heat equation without further intervention, will the integral \\\\( g(u(t)) \\\\) at a later time t = T be the same as if the initial temperature distribution u(x,0) was allowed to evolve to t = T under the heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(u) \\\\) at t=0 serves as a spatial filter or measurement that only captures certain aspects of the distribution due to the exponential term \\\\( e^{-ax} \\\\). As the heat equation evolves, the spatial characteristics of u(x,t) change, leading to different values of \\\\( g(u(t)) \\\\) over time.",
