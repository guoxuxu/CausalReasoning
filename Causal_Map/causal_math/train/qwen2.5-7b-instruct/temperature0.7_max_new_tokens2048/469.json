  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx + Nu\\\\), where M and N are matrices denoting the system dynamics and input matrix, respectively. We analyze the effect of the linear state feedback controller defined by \\\\( u(t) = Kx(t) \\\\), where K is a constant matrix.\n\nIf the feedback controller \\\\( u(t) = Kx(t) \\\\) is applied from the beginning and the system evolves under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx + Nu\\\\) with no other changes, will the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T develop differently than without the controller?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the feedback controller \\\\( K \\\\) modifies the input \\\\( u(t) \\\\), effectively changing the system dynamics to \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = (M + NK)x\\\\). This changes the evolution of the system's state over time, leading to a trajectory that differs from the uncontrolled system.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
