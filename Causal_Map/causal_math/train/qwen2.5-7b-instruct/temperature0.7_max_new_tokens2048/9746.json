  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency. We analyze how transformations by the integral operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{z\\\\} = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{-st}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant, affect the solution over time.\n\nCan the initial function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) be uniquely identified from the final state at t = T, without knowledge whether the transformation by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{z\\\\} \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the application of the integral operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{z\\\\} \\\\), you cannot uniquely determine the initial function. The transformation could significantly alter the function's trajectory, making it impossible to recover the original function uniquely based solely on its evolved state.",
