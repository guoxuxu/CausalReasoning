  "Problem": "We consider a system where the current at any time t in an electrical circuit is determined by the integral transformation \\\\( I(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-(t - \\\\tau)}V(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where \\\\( V(t) \\\\) represents the voltage source function. We also consider a time-dependent change in resistance modeled by the function \\\\( R(t) = 1 + \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\) affecting the voltage source.\n\nAfter observing the current \\\\( I(T) \\\\) at time T, can we unequivocally determine the voltage input \\\\( V(t) \\\\) for 0 < t < T without considering the effect of \\\\( R(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The current \\\\( I(T) \\\\) is a result of the convolution of the input voltage and an exponential decay modified by the time-dependent resistance. Without knowing the resistance profile, it's not possible to uniquely determine the voltage from the current.",
