  "Problem": "Consider a control system formulated by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx + u\\\\), where D is a constant matrix and u is a control vector. The study considers the transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(x) = e^{Mt}x \\\\), applied at certain intervals, where M is a distinct constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The potential application of \\\\( g(x) \\\\) at the initial state makes it challenging to reverse engineer to \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without clear information on whether the transformation was applied. The matrix M, if non-commutative with D, could have changed the initial conditions in a way that obscures the original vector.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
