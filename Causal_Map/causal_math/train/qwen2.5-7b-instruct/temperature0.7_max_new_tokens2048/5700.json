  "Problem": "Consider a complex dynamical system described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We examine the impact of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{-i\\\\theta}z \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is also a constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of phase shifts (\\\\( -\\\\theta \\\\)) and scalings (c) can lead to the same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) under the dynamical rules of \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\). The non-uniqueness arises from the continuous transformation possibilities in complex planes, making causal inference of interventions elusive.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
