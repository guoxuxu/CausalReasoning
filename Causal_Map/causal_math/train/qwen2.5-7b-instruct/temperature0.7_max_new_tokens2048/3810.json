  "Problem": "Consider a system represented by the integral transformation \\\\(Y(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} y(t) dt\\\\), where y(t) is a complex function and s is a complex variable. We explore the effects of a differential operator \\\\(D = \\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\) and how it acts on y(t) before and after the transformation.\n\nIf the transformed function \\\\(Y(s)\\\\) is given, can we accurately determine \\\\(y(0)\\\\) without additional information about the pre-transformation state of y(t)?",
  "Explanation": "While \\\\(Y(s)\\\\) provides comprehensive encoding of y(t) in the Laplace domain, extracting precisely \\\\(y(0)\\\\) requires inverse transformation and knowledge about the behavior of y(t) near t=0, which cannot be definitively resolved just from \\\\(Y(s)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The differential operator D influences y(t) by differentiating it, y(t) transforms into Y(s) via the integral transformation, but knowing Y(s) alone does not allow us to accurately determine y(0) without additional information about y(t) before the transformation."
