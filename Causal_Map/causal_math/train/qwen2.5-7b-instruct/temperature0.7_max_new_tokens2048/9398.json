  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state. We explore the effect of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another real constant.\n\nCan we infer the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T if we do not know whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied, it is unclear whether the starting point was \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or \\\\( e^{iBt}z_0 \\\\). As such, reconstructing \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) cannot be uniquely achieved without additional information about the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or the value of B.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Time T influences the state z(T) through the constant A; the transformation constant B affects the form of the transformation g(z), but without knowledge of g(z)'s application, T → z(T) remains the primary causal link."
