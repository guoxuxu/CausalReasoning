  "Problem": "Consider a reaction-diffusion system expressed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\Delta u + k(u)\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\Delta\\\\) is the Laplacian operator and \\\\(k(u)\\\\) is a nonlinear function of u. We study the effects of applying a Laplace transformation \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) over the spatial variable x.\n\nIf an intervention via another transformation, say a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), on \\\\(u(x,t_1)\\\\) at some time \\\\(t_1\\\\), changes the condition at that time, will the system's state at \\\\(T\\\\) where \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) still be predictable solely from the original PDE without accounting for the effects of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) or the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) during the process introduces a change in the modal energy distribution, influencing how diffusive and nonlinear dynamics play out subsequently. The final state at time T becomes a function of both transformations, the original PDE dynamics, and how they interplay.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u(x,t_1) influences the system's state u(x,T) through the nonlinear function k(u(x,t_1)). Applying a Fourier transform on u(x,t_1) at time t_1 may change its value, but this change does not directly affect the predictability of the system's state at T if the original PDE dynamics are considered without accounting for the Laplace transformation or the intervention."
