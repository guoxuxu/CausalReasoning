  "Problem": "Analyze a transfer function H(s) in the Laplace transform domain. Consider a linear system characterized by H(s) = 1/(s^2 + as + b), where a and b are constants. Let's study the impact of applying a unit step input U(s) = 1/s, and how it influences the system response.\n\nGiven the output Y(T) after time t1, can we decide which specific intervention (either changing constants to c, d or maintaining a, b) occurred by solely analyzing the value of Y(T)?",
  "Explanation": "The output Y(T) could potentially be achieved through multiple configurations of the system parameters (a, b, c, d). The net impact of different gain and pole changes introduced by various interventions could result in similar or indistinguishable system outputs at T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying a unit step input U(s) transforms into the output Y(s) through the system's transfer function H(s), and changing the constants a or b modifies H(s), which in turn affects Y(s)."
