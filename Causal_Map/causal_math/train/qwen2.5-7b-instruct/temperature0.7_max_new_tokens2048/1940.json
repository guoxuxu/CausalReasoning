  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\\\) where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent function and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number. The Laplace transform is modified by a multiplying operator \\\\( M(s) \\\\) resulting in a transformed function \\\\( G(s) = M(s)F(s) \\\\).\n\nBased on the altered transformed function \\\\( G(s) \\\\) at \\\\( s_0 \\\\), can we ascertain if the intervention was a change in \\\\( M(s) \\\\) at \\\\( s_0 \\\\) or a direct modification in \\\\( f(t) \\\\) related to \\\\( s_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the type of intervention based on \\\\( G(s) \\\\) at a specific point \\\\( s_0 \\\\) is challenging due to the inherent properties of the Laplace transform which blends the effects of frequency domain changes. Without additional specifics, both types of interventions could result in similar alterations in \\\\( G(s) \\\\), making it impossible to distinguish based solely on the final transformed function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of M(s) directly influences G(s), and the value of f(t) through its Laplace transform F(s) also directly influences G(s) via s_0."
