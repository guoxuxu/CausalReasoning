  "Problem": "Consider a functional analysis scenario where we have a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), where A, B, C, and D are constants. We apply a Laplace transform to both x and y: \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(x(t)) = X(s) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(y(t)) = Y(s) \\\\).\n\nCan we determine exactly which parameters were modified (A, B, or both) based on the final state Z(s) alone?",
  "Explanation": "Given Z(s) results from complex combinations of the dynamics of x and y, which are in turn influenced by both A and B, determining which specific parameters were changed based solely on Z(s) is infeasible without additional information about when or how interventions occurred. The transformations due to different parameter changes can have similar effects in the s-domain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
