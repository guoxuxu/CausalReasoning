  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz + N \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) are complex constants. We investigate how the transformation by the complex exponential function \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) impacts the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nFrom observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine the initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the evolutionary path of the complex function, and without knowing its application, the deduced initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) could be erroneous. The presence of \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) means any observation at \\\\( T \\\\) could correspond to multiple initial conditions, depending on if and how the transformation was applied.",
