  "Problem": "Consider a system described by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u) \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. The impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), which converts the function \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) into its frequency components \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,t) \\\\), is analyzed over time.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\), can we precisely identify the specific filtering operations used (if any), solely by examining \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting state \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) does not uniquely determine the type of interventions (such as specific filters) applied during the evolution. Multiple different filters could potentially lead to similar or identical outcomes at \\\\( T \\\\), especially without additional information or constraints about the changes to frequency components.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "u(x,T) → u(x,t); L(u) → u(x,t); u(x,t) → hat{u}(k,t); hat{L}(hat{u}) → hat{u}(k,t)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The final state u(x,T) influences the initial state u(x,t), and the operator L transforms u(x,t) into the state at time t. Applying the Fourier transform converts u(x,t) into its frequency components hat{u}(k,t), and the transformed operator hat{L} acts on hat{u}(k,t) to produce its state over time."
