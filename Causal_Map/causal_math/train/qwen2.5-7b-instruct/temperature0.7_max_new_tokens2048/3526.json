  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t + u_{xx} = 0\\\\), where \\\\(u_t\\\\) and \\\\(u_{xx}\\\\) are the time and second space derivatives of \\\\(u\\\\), respectively. To study the problem, we use the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-ikx} u(x,t)dx\\\\).\n\nCan we accurately deduce \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, 0)\\\\) after observing \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) without knowing the initial transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given the transformation \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T) = \\\\hat{u}(k, 0)e^{-k^2T}\\\\) follows directly from the properties of solutions to the heat equation under the Fourier transform, one can uniquely recover \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, 0)\\\\) by computing \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, 0) = \\\\hat{u}(k, T)e^{k^2T}\\\\). This recovery is possible due to the exponential decay term being well-defined for all \\\\(k\\\\) and \\\\(T\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u(x,0) influences the solution u(x,t) over time, which in turn affects its Fourier transform hat{u}(k,t). Observing hat{u}(k,T) allows deduction of hat{u}(k,0) due to the time evolution described by the PDE."
