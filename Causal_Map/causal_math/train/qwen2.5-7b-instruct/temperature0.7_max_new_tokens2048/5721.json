  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined in the complex plane \\\\( z = x + yi \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are real numbers. The transformation is given by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant complex matrix. We examine the differential effects of this transformation on the trajectories of points in the complex plane.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then allows the point to evolve under its natural dynamics without further intervention, will the point's trajectory at time \\\\( T \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was simply left to evolve naturally to time \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) fundamentally alters the initial condition by applying the complex exponential, which impacts both the growth rate and rotation of the point's trajectory in the complex plane. This leads to a different trajectory than if the point had evolved without the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation f(z) to a point z_0 and allowing it to evolve under its natural dynamics from time 0 to T results in the same trajectory as if z_0 was simply left to evolve naturally to time T."
