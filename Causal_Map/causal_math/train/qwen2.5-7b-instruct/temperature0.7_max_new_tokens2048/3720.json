  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{u}(x, t) \\\\) described by the Navier-Stokes equations with a divergence-free condition. Study the effect of introducing a scalar field \\\\( \\\\theta(x, t) = T(x)e^{\\lambda t} \\\\), where T(x) represents a temperature distribution and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a growth rate, on heat transfer characteristics of the flow.\n\nCan we determine unequivocally whether modulation of the flow with \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v}(x, t) \\\\) was implemented, solely by observing the temperature distribution \\\\( \\\\theta(x, T) \\\\) at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting temperature field \\\\( \\\\theta(x, T) \\\\) may be similar for different values of \\\\( k \\\\) or even in its absence due to the complex interactions and compensations between advection, diffusion, and external effects. Thus, it's not possible to uniquely pinpoint the intervening controls just by observing the end state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The spatial temperature distribution T(x) and the growth rate λ jointly cause the temperature field θ(x, t), which in turn influences the heat transfer characteristics of the flow."
