  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear operator. We investigate the effects of applying a Fourier transform, denoted as \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t))\\\\), on this system.\n\nGiven the final Fourier-transformed state \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\), can we precisely determine what operations were performed on \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) (whether due to L, M, or both), solely from \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple different sequences or types of operations (involving L, M, or their combinations) could yield the same resulting state \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\), due to the possible overlapping effects in the Fourier domain. The dynamics in the transform space do not allow us to distinctly trace back to each specific operation or interaction in the original function space.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the linear operator L or M to u(x, t) results in changes to u(x, t), which are then transformed by the Fourier transform to affect \\(\\hat{u}(k, t)\\). The final state \\(\\hat{u}(k, T)\\) reflects the combined effect of L, M, and time evolution."
