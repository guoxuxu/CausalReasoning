  "Problem": "Analyze the relationship between input function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and output function \\\\( y(t) \\\\) in a system governed by the convolution operation with an impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\), specified as \\\\( y(t) = x(t) \\\\ast h(t) \\\\). Consider two functions, \\\\( h_1(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h_2(t) \\\\), where \\\\( h_2(t) = t \\\\ast h_1(t) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( x(t) \\\\) by integrating it (\\\\( \\\\int x(t) dt \\\\)) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) in a system with impulse response \\\\( h_1(t) \\\\), will the final output still be equivalent to processing \\\\( \\\\int x(t) dt \\\\) through \\\\( h_2(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integration of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) as an intervention introduces a different transformation, and the convolution with \\\\( h_1(t) \\\\) versus \\\\( h_2(t) \\\\) subsequently processes this altered signal differently. The initial integration shifts the frequency components of \\\\( x(t) \\\\), subsequently affecting how the signal interacts with each impulse response distinctly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Input function x(t) is convolved with impulse response h1(t) to produce output y(t). Integrating x(t) results in a new input that is convolved with h2(t), which is derived from h1(t) through convolution with t, to produce the same output y(t) as if the integrated input was convolved with h1(t)."
