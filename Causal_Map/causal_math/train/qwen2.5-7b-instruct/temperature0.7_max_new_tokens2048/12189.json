  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t is time and i is the imaginary unit. We evaluate the impact of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-i} \\\\), which transforms the complex exponential function into a function of a complex variable s.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-i} \\\\), can we determine the exact original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) from which it was transformed without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( e^{it} \\\\), resulting in \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-i} \\\\), is unique to this form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). There would be no ambiguity in mapping back from \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-i} \\\\) to \\\\( e^{it} \\\\) as its inverse transform uniquely corresponds to \\\\( e^{it} \\\\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The original function z(t) = e^(it) is transformed into L{z(t)}(s) = 1/(s-i) through the Laplace transform; s and i directly influence the form of L{z(t)}(s), while z(t) determines the pre-transformed function."
