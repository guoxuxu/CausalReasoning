  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz + N \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) are complex constants. We investigate how the transformation by the complex exponential function \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) impacts the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz + N \\\\) without any other intervention, will the resulting \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T differ from what would occur if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was evolved directly under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz + N \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega 0}z_0 = z_0 \\\\), but as time progresses, the factor \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) increasingly influences the solution trajectory due to its multiplicative effect with \\\\( z(t) \\\\), resulting in a different trajectory and final state at \\\\( t = T \\\\) compared to the direct evolution of \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the transformation f(z) = e^(iωt)z to z_0 at t=0, followed by evolution under dz/dt = Mz + N, results in a z(t) that is phase-shifted compared to the direct evolution of z_0 under the same differential equation."
