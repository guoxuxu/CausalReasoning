  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear operator. We explore the influence of a transformation characterized by the function \\\\( t(x) = \\\\int e^{sx} ds \\\\) on spatial variable x, where s represents a parameter.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(x) = \\\\int k^x dx \\\\) (where k is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on L and not on the effects of s or k?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(x) \\\\) introduces a new factor, influencing the final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) based not only on L but also on the effects of both s and k. The transformations induced by \\\\( t(x) \\\\) and \\\\( h(x) \\\\) can affect the system's trajectory cumulatively, leading to a dependency on multiple variables.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
