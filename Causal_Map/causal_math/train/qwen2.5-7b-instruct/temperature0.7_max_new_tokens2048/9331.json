  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(w) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-sw}x(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( x(s) \\\\) is a function and \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( w \\\\) are complex variables. We explore the impact of the transformation defined by \\\\( g(x) = x(s)e^{as} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nDuring the computation of \\\\( z(w) \\\\), if after some time \\\\( s_1 \\\\), another exponential factor \\\\( e^{bs} \\\\) (\\\\( b \\\\neq a \\\\)) is introduced, forming a new modified function, will the final result of \\\\( z(w) \\\\) only depend on the original \\\\( x(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional intervention, introducing \\\\( e^{bs} \\\\) at time \\\\( s_1 \\\\), changes the integral to \\\\( \\\\int_0^{s_1} e^{-sw}x(s)e^{as} ds + \\\\int_{s_1}^\\\\infty e^{-sw}x(s)e^{as}e^{bs} ds \\\\), creating a dependency on both parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) and the point of intervention \\\\( s_1 \\\\). This mixed composition affects the final \\\\( z(w) \\\\).",
