  "Problem": "Consider a thermodynamic system where the temperature \\( T \\) inside a reactor is controlled by a function \\( u(t, T) = kT + c \\), where \\( k \\) and \\( c \\) are constants. Here, \\( k \\) represents a proportional control on the temperature, and \\( c \\) is a constant heating term. We explore scenarios applying a linear transformation function \\( v(T) = mT + n \\) where \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are constants, altering \\( T \\) at various instants.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\( T(T) \\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\( v(T) \\), \\( w(T) \\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\( T(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The multiple possible ways to achieve a particular temperature \\( T(T) \\) using different combinations of \\( v(T) \\) and \\( w(T) \\), and possibly applying them at different times or with different parameters, results in an inherent ambiguity. This makes it impossible to definitively trace back and pinpoint the specific interventions and their parameters used.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
