  "Problem": "Assume a complex function \\\\( z(t): \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\) described by the equation \\\\( z'(t) = iAz(t) \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex scalar. Consider an intervention operation \\\\( h(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\) applied at time t, where \\\\( B \\\\) is another complex scalar.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z'(t) = iAz(t) \\\\) without further intervention, will the function value \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be equal to the evolution of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) directly to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the operation \\\\( h(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\) at t=0 changes the initial conditions. Although both A and B are complex scalars, they introduce phase rotations which accumulate differently over time, leading to a different complex function value at t = T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the intervention operation h(z) at t=0 transforms z(t) to a new state, which then evolves under the differential equation z'(t) = iAz(t) to produce z(t) at any later time t=T. Without further intervention, the function value z(t) at t=T is the result of the initial transformation by h(z) followed by the evolution under the given differential equation."
