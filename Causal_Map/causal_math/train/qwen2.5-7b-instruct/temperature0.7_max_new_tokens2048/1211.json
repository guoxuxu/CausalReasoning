  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed by a Fourier Transform, resulting in \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\). To further analyze or manipulate the signal, an operator \\\\( P(\\\\omega) \\\\) is applied in the frequency domain.\n\nIf an intervention function \\\\( Q(\\\\omega) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( P(\\\\omega)X(\\\\omega) \\\\) after \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) is computed, will the resultant inverse Fourier Transform still purely depend on \\\\( P(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional intervention \\\\( Q(\\\\omega) \\\\) modifies \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) already impacted by \\\\( P(\\\\omega) \\\\), thus the result, when taken inverse Fourier Transform, will depend on both \\\\( P(\\\\omega) \\\\) and \\\\( Q(\\\\omega) \\\\) and not just on \\\\( P(\\\\omega) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The signal x(t) is transformed by the Fourier Transform to produce X(ω). The operator P(ω) is then applied to X(ω), and if an intervention function Q(ω) is applied to the result, it modifies P(ω)X(ω) to Q(ω)P(ω)X(ω). The inverse Fourier Transform of this modified signal will depend on both P(ω) and Q(ω)."
