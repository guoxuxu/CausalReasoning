  "Problem": "A function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is defined in the complex plane and its evolution is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iCz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. Consider the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is another real constant, and analyze its effects on the system's behavior over time.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we infer the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0, the compounded effects of the exponential modifications due to \\\\( D \\\\) cannot be distinguished from the natural evolution of the system under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iCz \\\\). This uncertainty in initial modification leads to ambiguity in deducing \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of z with respect to time (z'(t)) directly causes the value of z at a future time step (z(t+Δt)). The constant C directly causes the value of z at any given time (z(t)). The constant D directly causes the transformation g(z). The initial value of z (z(0)) directly causes the final state of z (z(T))."
