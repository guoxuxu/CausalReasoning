  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system described by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. The system is subject to an input function \\\\( g(x, t) \\\\) affecting the system's state. An integral transformation, specifically the Laplace transform, is used to analyze the behavior over time.\n\nGiven the transformed final state \\\\( U(s) \\\\) at a certain point, can we identify whether an operator intervention \\\\( M \\\\) was applied, solely based on the information available in \\\\( U(s) \\\\) and the knowledge of operator \\\\( L \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of the final state \\\\( U(s) \\\\) encodes the effects of the initial conditions, input functions, and any changes in the system operator over time. Identifying the presence and type of intervention like \\\\( M \\\\) solely from \\\\( U(s) \\\\) and \\\\( L \\\\), without additional temporal details or constraints, generally cannot be performed unambiguously due to the possible equivalency of different inputs and interventions leading to the same transformed state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input function g(x, t) directly influences the system state u, the linear operator L transforms the system state into its Laplace domain representation U(s), and if an operator intervention M is applied to L, it changes L, which in turn affects U(s). Given U(s) and knowing L, we may infer whether M was applied."
