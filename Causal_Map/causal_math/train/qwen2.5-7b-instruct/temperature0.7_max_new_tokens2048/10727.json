  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant and \\( t \\) represents time. The system undergoes a Fourier transformation defined by \\( \\hat{z}(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt \\).\n\nIf a modulation function \\( m(t) = e^{-i\\alpha t} \\) (where \\( \\alpha \\) is another constant) is applied to \\( z(t) \\) before taking the Fourier transform, will the result still be a delta function centered at the original \\( \\omega \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The modulation changes the frequency component of the signal; the new function becomes \\( e^{i(\\omega - \\alpha)t} \\). Its Fourier transform results in a delta function centered at \\( \\omega - \\alpha \\) instead of \\( \\omega \\), demonstrating the shift in frequency due to the intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
