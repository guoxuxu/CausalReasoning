  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transformation \\\\( L(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) applied to a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\). Analyze the impact of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(f)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\omega t} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) on the modified function and its interpretation.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(f)(\\\\omega) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and then the Laplace transform is applied to \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(f)(\\\\omega) \\\\), will the resultant transformation provide the same output as directly applying the Laplace transform \\\\( L(f)(s) \\\\) to \\\\( f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform alters the domain and properties of \\\\( f(t) \\\\), converting it into a frequency-domain representation which changes how the resulting function behaves under the Laplace transform. The alteration from time-domain to frequency-domain affects the applicability and results of the Laplace transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Laplace transform to the Fourier transform of a function f(t) results in a different output than directly applying the Laplace transform to f(t). The Fourier transform of f(t) yields F(f)(ω), which when further transformed by the Laplace transform with respect to s, does not equate to the direct Laplace transform L(f)(s) of f(t)."
