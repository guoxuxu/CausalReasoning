  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\(z(t)\\\\), which is applied to an input function \\\\(x(t)\\\\) in a linear system defined by the integral transform \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty h(t-u) x(u) du \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is the system's impulse response. An additional transformation \\\\( g(t) = e^{Ct}x(t) \\\\) (where C is a constant matrix) is considered as an intervention.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the function \\\\( g(t) = e^{Ct}x(t) \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the outcome \\\\( y(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 only depend on \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and not on \\\\( C \\\\) or initial \\\\( x(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(t) \\\\) modifies \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), thereby altering future values of \\\\( y(t) \\\\). The change in \\\\( x(t) \\\\) due to \\\\( C \\\\) affects the integral transform outcome, making \\\\( y(T) \\\\) dependent on both the impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and the transformation matrix \\\\( C \\\\), along with the initial state of \\\\( x(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the intervention g(t) = e^(Ct)x(t) at time t_1 changes x(t) for t >= t_1, which then affects y(t) through the system's impulse response h(t-u). The effect of g(t) on y(T) for T > t_1 depends on both h(t) and the modified x(t) due to g(t), but not directly on C."
