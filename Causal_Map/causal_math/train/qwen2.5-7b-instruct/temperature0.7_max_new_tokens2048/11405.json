  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution across an object is described by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = \\\\kappa \\\\nabla^2 u \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) is the temperature, \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity, and \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 \\\\) is the Laplacian operator. We investigate the effects of applying a thermal source function described by \\\\( f(u) = \\\\alpha e^{-\\\\beta t} u \\\\) on the temperature distribution over time t, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) are constants.\n\nIf the function \\\\( f(u) \\\\) is applied to the temperature distribution \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( u_t = \\\\kappa \\\\nabla^2 u \\\\) without further intervention, will the temperature distribution \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( u_t = \\\\kappa \\\\nabla^2 u \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of the thermal source \\\\( f(u) \\\\) initially modifies the temperature distribution due to \\\\( \\\\alpha e^{-\\\\beta t} u \\\\) that decays exponentially with time but impacts the initial and subsequent temperature distribution at T, altering the system's trajectory away from that due solely to diffusive spread.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the thermal source function f(u) leads to a different temperature distribution u_t compared to evolving u_0 directly under the heat equation u_t = κ∇^2u without the source. Over time t, the presence of f(u) influences u through the heat equation, resulting in a distinct u(t) compared to the scenario without f(u)."
