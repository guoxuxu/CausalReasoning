  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, where the function evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iCz \\\\), with C being a real constant. The evolution of the system is transformed by an integral operator \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-iCs} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( T(z) \\\\), the accumulated impact of the integration and the phase shifts introduced by \\\\( e^{-iCs} \\\\) on the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) obscure the ability to reverse engineer to the function's original state at t = 0.",
