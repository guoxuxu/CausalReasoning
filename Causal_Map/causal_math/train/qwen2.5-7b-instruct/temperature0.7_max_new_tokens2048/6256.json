  "Problem": "A physical system's temperature distribution, u(x,t), satisfies the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), with k being the thermal diffusivity. A transformation \\\\( g(u) = u + Ce^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\), where C and \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) are constants, is studied to evaluate its effect on the system.\n\nKnowing only the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\), can one definitively ascertain whether transformations \\\\( g(u) \\\\), \\\\( h(u) \\\\), or both were applied during the system's evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Given the overlap in potential changes induced by \\\\( g(u) \\\\) and \\\\( h(u) \\\\), and their integration into the heat dynamics, different combinations of these transformations could yield similar or identical distributions at time T, making it impossible to distinguish definitively between these scenarios solely based on \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
