  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) driven by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iAz \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The system undergoes a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf an additional phase shift operator \\\\( P(z) = z(t)e^{iBt} \\\\) (where B is a real constant) is applied after the initial Fourier transform and before the system evolves naturally, does the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend only on the original \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the phase shift operator adds another dimension to the system's evolution. The final function \\\\( z(T) \\\\) comprehensively depends on both the original system parameter \\\\( A \\\\) and the intervention parameter \\\\( B \\\\). The interaction between these two influences the complex rotation and amplitude modulation of the function throughout its evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The endpoint z(T) depends on A through the differential equation and is influenced by P(z) which introduces a phase shift but does not change the dependence on A."
