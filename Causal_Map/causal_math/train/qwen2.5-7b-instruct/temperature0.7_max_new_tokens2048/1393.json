  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z = x + iy\\\\), with a real transformation described by \\\\(T(x, y) = (u(x, y), v(x, y))\\\\). Assume \\\\(T\\\\) results in a new function \\\\(w = u + iv\\\\), where \\\\(u(x, y) = 2x + 3y\\\\) and \\\\(v(x, y) = 5x - 4y\\\\). Analyze the role of the Laplace transformation \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) for each case, with the Laplace transform defined as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt\\\\).\n\nIf we apply the transformation \\\\(T\\\\) to \\\\(z\\\\) without further transformation and take the Laplace transform, will the transformed result \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{w(t)\\\\}\\\\) be the same as directly applying the Laplace transformation to each component individually?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(T\\\\) alters the original function components in a nonlinear manner, thereby affecting their Laplace transforms. Since the new function components \\\\(u\\\\) and \\\\(v\\\\) are linear combinations of \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\), the results of their Laplace transforms will not just be a straightforward addition of the transforms of \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\).",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation T(x, y) → w, and then taking the Laplace transform L{w(t)} may differ from directly applying the Laplace transform to each component L{u(t)} and L{v(t)} individually, as the Laplace transform is a property of functions of time t, whereas w is a function of x and y."
