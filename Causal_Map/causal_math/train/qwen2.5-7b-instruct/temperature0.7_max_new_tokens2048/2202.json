  "Problem": "Consider a system based on a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The impact study involves the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a real constant, applied at varying times.\n\nCan we conclusively determine the initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) as T approaches infinity, without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), it's impossible to uniquely determine whether the observed magnitude and phase changes of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) are solely due to the exponential operation by \\\\( k \\\\) or natural evolution under \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\). Different combinations of \\\\( k \\\\) and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) might yield similar endpoints, especially as T approaches infinity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of omega directly causes the rate of change of z with respect to time. The value of k directly causes the transformation of z over time through g(z). The value of time directly causes the value of z. The initial value of z directly causes the value of z at any later time."
