  "Problem": "Consider a linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) system given by \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = Ax(t)\\\\) where A is a matrix governing the system dynamics. The impact of a transformation \\\\(T(x) = e^{Ct}x(t)\\\\), where C is also a matrix, on this system is examined. The ODE system is studied under typical operation and after application of a transformation.\n\nCan we determine all previous transformations, such as application of \\\\(T(x)\\\\) and \\\\(G(x)\\\\), used throughout the period 0 to T, given only the final state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) and knowledge of A?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) can result from varying sequences of transformations due to the non-commutative nature of matrix multiplication and different matrices C and D. This complexity makes it impossible to uniquely back-calculate the exact transformations used without further specific data on C and D.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The matrix A governs the change in x(t) over time, the matrix C defines the transformation T(x), and applying T(x) results in the state x(T) at time T."
