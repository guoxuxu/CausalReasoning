  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\\\( x'(t) = Lx(t) \\\\) where L is a linear operator on a function space, and the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) of \\\\( x(t) \\\\). Analyze how the system behaves under the Fourier transform and its inverse transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\).\n\nCan the original function \\\\( x_0 \\\\) be determined after observing \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at T, without knowing whether the Fourier transform was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on the application of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), the alterations made in the frequency domain can obscure the original characteristics of \\\\( x_0 \\\\). Changes induced by L in the transformed domain may not be directly invertible to retrieve \\\\( x_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "x'(t) → x(t); L → x'(t); x(t) → x(T); Fourier transform → X(ω); X(ω) → x(t); x(t) → x_0; x(T) → x_0",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of x(t) is influenced by L, x(t) evolves over time to become x(T), the Fourier transform of x(t) results in X(ω), the inverse Fourier transform recovers x(t), and x(T) can potentially determine x_0 if the Fourier transform process is known."
