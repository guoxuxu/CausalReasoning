  "Problem": "Assume a linear system described by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\Delta u = 0\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) is a complex function of a spatial variable. We investigate how the application of Fourier transformation, denoted by \\\\(\\mathcal{F}\\\\), impacts the causal inference of effects in this system.\n\nIf the Fourier Transform \\\\(\\mathcal{F}(u)\\\\) is applied to the function \\\\(u(x)\\\\) and it undergoes normal evolution under the Laplace equation, will the transformed state at spatial point and time \\\\(x, T\\\\) reflect only the properties of \\\\(\\Delta u = 0\\\\) - without external influences?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform alters the domain from spatial to frequency, yet does not change the fundamental solutions of the Laplace equation since it is a linear operator. Hence, the evolution only reflects the inherent properties governed by \\\\(\\Delta u = 0\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
