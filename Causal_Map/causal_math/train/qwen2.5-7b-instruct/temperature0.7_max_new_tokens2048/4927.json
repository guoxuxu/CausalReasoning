  "Problem": "Consider a linear space of complex functions, where each function obeys the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2 u}{dx^2} = -\\\\lambda u\\\\), and \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) is a constant. We explore how the Laplace transform, defined by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(u)(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-sx}u(x)dx\\\\), influences the solutions.\n\nIf after applying the Laplace transform to \\\\(u(x)\\\\), we multiply the result by a function \\\\(g(s) = e^{-as}\\\\) (where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant) and then transform it back, will the resulting spatial function still satisfy the original differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying by \\\\(e^{-as}\\\\) and then taking the inverse transform essentially translates the function \\\\(u(x)\\\\), resulting in \\\\(u(x-a)\\\\). The translated function still satisfies the same homogeneous differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2 u}{dx^2} = -\\\\lambda u\\\\), thereby preserving the nature of solutions to the equation.",
