  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We explore the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^te^{-i\\\\omega s}z(s)ds \\\\) applied to \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nCan the original function form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 be reconstructed precisely after observing the result of \\\\( g(z)(T) \\\\) without knowing \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or \\\\( k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The value of \\\\( g(z)(T) \\\\) alone, without the knowledge of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or \\\\( k \\\\), is insufficient to uniquely reconstruct the original function since \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is an integral that encompasses all prior states, potentially with multiple combinations leading to the same result.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial value of z(t) at t=0 influences z(t) over time, and the parameters ω and k affect z(t) through the differential equation. The integral transformation g(z) depends on z(t) and thus indirectly on z(0), ω, and k."
