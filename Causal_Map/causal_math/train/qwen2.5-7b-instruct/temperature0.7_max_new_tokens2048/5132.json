  "Problem": "We consider a linear system transformed by applying a Fourier Transform to its input signal \\(x(t)\\), resulting in \\(X(ω) = ℱ\\{x(t)\\}\\). Let the system be characterized by the differential equation \\(\\\\dot{y} = Ky\\), where \\(K\\) is a constant matrix, and the output given by \\(y(t)\\) is also transformed, \\(Y(ω) = ℱ\\{y(t)\\}\\).\n\nGiven the transformed output \\(Y(ω)\\), can we exactly trace back to determine if the input was affected by \\(h(t) = e^{Dt}x(t)\\), knowing only the values of \\(Y(ω)\\) and \\(K\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While \\(Y(ω)\\) is influenced by the transformations through \\(K\\) and potentially \\(D\\), the frequency domain representation does not provide clear-cut evidence of the particular form of the input transformation without additional information. The impact of \\(D\\) on the transformation could resemble other potential modification mechanisms, leaving ambiguity about the specific intervention used.",
