  "Problem": "Analyze a stochastic process where \\\\( X(t) \\\\) evolves according to the stochastic differential equation \\\\( dX = AX dt + BX dW \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constant matrices, and \\\\( dW \\\\) represents the differential of a Wiener process. Consider the effect of the transformation \\\\( f(X) = e^{CX} \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(X) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( X_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then \\\\( X(t) \\\\) is allowed to evolve according to its stochastic differential equation without further intervention, will the distribution of \\\\( X(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( X_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the given SDE?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(X) = e^{CX} \\\\) changes the initial distribution by applying a non-linear transformation, impacting the trajectory of the process. The stochastic nature of \\\\( dW \\\\) and the effect of \\\\( C \\\\) result in a differing distribution by time T.",
