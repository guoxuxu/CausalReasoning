  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. We study the effect of differentiating this function and the subsequent application of a Fourier transform.\n\nGiven the Fourier transform of a differentiated and phase-shifted version of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), can the original function and the specific intervention (phase shift) be accurately determined?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the differentiated and phase-shifted function will reveal the frequency component, but disentangling the original function and identifying the exact phase shift value from the Fourier transform alone is challenging. The phase information in the Fourier Transform does not uniquely determine the phase shift applied to the original function; it could correspond to multiple possible phase shifts or none due to symmetry in the Fourier transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The angular frequency directly influences the function z(t), which then leads to the creation of both the differentiated version of z(t) and the phase-shifted version of z(t). The differentiated version and the phase-shifted version of z(t) both serve as inputs for the Fourier transform."
