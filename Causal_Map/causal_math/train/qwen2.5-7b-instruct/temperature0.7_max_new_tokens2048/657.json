  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function f(z) defined on the complex plane, governed by the differential equation \\\\( f'(z) = az^2 + bz + c \\\\) where a, b, and c are complex constants. We analyze the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{z} f(t) dt \\\\) applied to this system.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is computed for an initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\), and then \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is allowed to evolve under its differential equation until a final point z, without any additional transformations, will \\\\( g(z) \\\\) evaluated from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) directly reveal the final form of f(z)?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) accumulates values of f over a path, but does not directly reveal specific details or changes in the function f(z) itself from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to z unless specific boundary conditions or additional information about the linear coefficients is known. The integral transformation conceals variations within the interval.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The derivative of f with respect to z influences f, the initial value z_0 determines g at z_0, and z_0 progresses to z."
