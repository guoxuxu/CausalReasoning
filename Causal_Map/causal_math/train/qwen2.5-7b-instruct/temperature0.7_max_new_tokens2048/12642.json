  "Problem": "Consider a linear reaction-diffusion system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t = Du_{xx} + cu\\\\) on a domain [0, L] with Neumann boundary conditions, where D is a diffusion coefficient and c is a reaction term. We examine the impact of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int_{0}^{L} e^{-ikx} u(x, t) dx\\\\) applied to this system.\n\nIf an intervention alters the reaction term from c to a different constant c' at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the Fourier transformed condition \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the original parameters D and c?",
  "Explanation": "The change in the reaction term partway through the process affects the dynamics of the reaction-diffusion equation. This modification influences the evolution in the Fourier domain as well, causing \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) to depend on c', in addition to D and the transformed initial condition.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Fourier transform \\(\\hat{u}(k, T)\\) at time T > t_1 depends on the reaction term c through the function u(x, t), which in turn influences \\(\\hat{u}(k, t)\\) via the diffusion coefficient D and the change in reaction term from c to c'."
