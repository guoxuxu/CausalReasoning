  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where A is a real constant matrix, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We inspect how the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\) affects the system's behavior over time t, where B is also a real constant matrix.\n\nAfter observing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T > 0, can we precisely determine the initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( e^{iBt}z \\\\) could have altered the initial conditions such that multiple possible starting vectors \\\\( z_0 \\\\), when modified by different \\\\( B \\\\) values, could lead to the same observed state at T. Thus, without specific knowledge of \\\\( B \\\\) or whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely identified.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z at time T (z(T)) is causally influenced by the initial value of z (z_0) and the rate of change of z (A → dz/dt), while the transformation h(z) depends on the matrix B and time t."
