  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We study the impact of the transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) over time t, where C is another constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( k(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on A and B and not on C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( k(z) \\\\) introduces additional dynamics that alter the system's trajectory, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent not only on A and B but also significantly on C and D. The new transformation affects both the trajectory and potentially the type of dynamics experienced by the system components.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
