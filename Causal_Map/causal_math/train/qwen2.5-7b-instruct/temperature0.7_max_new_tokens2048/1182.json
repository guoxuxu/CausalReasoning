  "Problem": "Consider a system expressed by the Laplace transform \\\\( L(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)dt \\\\). The system is initially defined by the function \\\\( f(t) = t^2 \\\\). An external operation applies the transformation function \\\\( g(t) = t^3 \\\\) at some time t = 0.\n\nGiven the result of \\\\( L(h)(s) \\\\) for some s, can we deduce whether the transformation \\\\( g(t) \\\\) was applied to obtain \\\\( h(t) \\\\) from \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without prior knowledge of the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome of the Laplace transform \\\\( L(h)(s) \\\\) alone, without knowing whether \\\\( g(t) \\\\) was applied, doesn't provide enough information to uniquely determine the original function used (whether it was \\\\( f(t) \\\\) or \\\\( h(t) \\\\)). The transformation fundamentally alters the function, affecting the inverse deduction of initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
