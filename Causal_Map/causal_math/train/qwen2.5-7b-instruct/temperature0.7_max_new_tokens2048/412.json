  "Problem": "We investigate a signal processing system characterized by a linear time-invariant (LTI) system governed by the convolution \\\\( y(t) = h(t) * x(t) \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is the system’s impulse response and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is the input signal. An integral transform, specifically the Fourier transform, is applied to the signal defined as \\\\( \\\\hat{x}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty x(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed output \\\\( \\\\hat{y}(\\\\omega) \\\\), can we determine if the changes were due to interventions on \\\\( x(t) \\\\) or \\\\( h(t) \\\\) or both?",
  "Explanation": "Analyzing \\\\( \\\\hat{y}(\\\\omega) \\\\) alone does not allow us to uniquely pinpoint whether changes originated from interventions on \\\\( x(t) \\\\), \\\\( h(t) \\\\), or both, as multiple combinations of changes in these functions can produce similar effects in the transformed output. The indistinguishability arises from the convolution's nature and the properties of the Fourier transform, blending effects seamlessly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "x(t) → y(t); h(t) → y(t); x(t) → hat(x)(ω); h(t) → hat(h)(ω); hat(x)(ω) → hat(y)(ω); hat(h)(ω) → hat(y)(ω)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input signal x(t) and the system's impulse response h(t) both directly cause the output signal y(t). The input signal x(t) and the system's impulse response h(t) are transformed by the Fourier transform to yield their respective frequency domain representations hat(x)(ω) and hat(h)(ω), which in turn directly cause the transformed output hat(y)(ω)."
