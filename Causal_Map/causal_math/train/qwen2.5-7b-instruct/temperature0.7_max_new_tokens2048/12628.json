  "Problem": "Consider the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax \\\\) governing a system, where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix. A Fourier transform \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}x(t) dt \\\\) is applied to transform the function over time.\n\nIf \\\\( x(t) \\\\) evolves under the rule \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax \\\\) from t = 0 to t = T without any intervention, will the Fourier transform at the end, \\\\( F(T) \\\\), be similar to applying the Fourier transform at any intermediate time t and continuing from there?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform incorporates all the history of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from 0 to infinity, scaling each moment by \\\\( e^{-st} \\\\). Transforming at an intermediate time t and continuing means losing all contributions from earlier times, thus affecting the result of \\\\( F(T) \\\\).",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of x(t) over time due to the matrix A directly influences its Fourier transform F(s). Since dx/dt = Ax, changes in x(t) propagate through A to affect F(s). Therefore, applying the Fourier transform at any intermediate time t and continuing from there will yield a Fourier transform F(T) that is equivalent to applying it directly at T without interruption."
