  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model of a fluid flow which density ρ at a point (x, y, z) in space varies over time. The flow is defined by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\rho}{\\\\partial t} = -\\\\nabla \\\\cdot (\\\\rho \\\\mathbf{v}) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\) is the velocity field. An intervention is modeled by a transformation \\\\( g(\\\\rho) = \\\\rho \\\\exp(-kt) \\\\), with k being a positive constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(\\\\rho) \\\\) is applied to the initial density distribution \\\\( \\\\rho_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\rho}{\\\\partial t} = -\\\\nabla \\\\cdot (\\\\rho \\\\mathbf{v}) \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( \\\\rho(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( \\\\rho_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the specified differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\\\( g(\\\\rho) \\\\) changes the initial condition by scaling the density, which modifies how the density evolves under fluid flow. The exponential decay factor introduced by the transformation explicitly alters the behavior and distribution of \\\\( \\\\rho \\\\) over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation g(ρ) modifies the density ρ, which then evolves according to the differential equation ∇ · (ρ v) → ∂ρ/∂t. Without further intervention, the evolved density ρ(t) at time T will differ from the direct evolution of ρ_0 under the same differential equation."
