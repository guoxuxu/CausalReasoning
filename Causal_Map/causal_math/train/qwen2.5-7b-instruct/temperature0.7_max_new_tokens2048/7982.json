  "Problem": "Consider a physical system characterized by Laplace's equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 \\phi = 0\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) represents a potential function in a field. The transformation applied is through a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex representation of spatial coordinates.\n\nCan we deduce the original spatial coordinates \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing the potential field \\\\(\\\\phi(x, y, t)\\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\(\\\\phi(x, y, t)\\\\) is not feasible without explicit knowledge of the transformation, as the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) might have drastically shifted the spatial variables, leading to different potential field configurations unknown from the outcome alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
