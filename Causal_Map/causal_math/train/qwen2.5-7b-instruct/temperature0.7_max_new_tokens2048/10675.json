  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Sturm-Liouville problem \\\\( -\\\\frac{d}{dx}\\\\left(p(x) \\\\frac{dy}{dx}\\\\right) + q(x)y = \\\\lambda w(x)y \\\\), where \\\\( p(x), q(x), w(x) \\\\) are given functions and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is the eigenvalue. An integral transformation \\\\( T[y](x) = \\\\int_{a}^{b} k(x, t)y(t)dt \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( k(x, t) \\\\) is the kernel of the transformation.\n\nIf an intervention alters the kernel to \\\\( k'(x, t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) (where \\\\( k' \\\\) differs from \\\\( k \\\\)), will the final state of \\\\( y(x) \\\\) at \\\\( t_2 \\\\) depend solely on the original Sturm-Liouville operators and not on the changes in the kernel?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the kernel to \\\\( k'(x, t) \\\\) during the transformation process introduces a new set of conditions and potential modifications to the resultant function's behavior under the Sturm-Liouville problem. This change affects how the function aligns with the eigenvalue problem, making the final state dependent on both the original and altered kernel.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Changes in the kernel k(x, t) at time t_1 cause a change in the transformed function T[y](x), which then influences the final state of y(x) at time t_2. The original Sturm-Liouville operators (p(x), q(x), w(x)) directly cause the state of y(x), and changes to the kernel k'(x, t) introduce a new transformation T'[y](x) that affects y(x) at t_2."
