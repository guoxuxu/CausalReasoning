  "Problem": "Let us consider a system of linear differential equations represented by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant coefficient matrix. We analyze the effects of applying a Fourier transform, defined as \\\\( F(x(t)) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty x(t)e^{-iwt}dt \\\\), on this system over time.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( F(x(t)) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\) without any other intervention, will the spectrum \\\\( F(x(t)) \\\\) at frequency \\\\( w \\\\) solely depend on the matrix \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( x(t) \\\\), which is governed by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), reflects the system’s characteristics encoded in \\\\( M \\\\). The resulting spectrum directly depends on how \\\\( M \\\\) affects the system’s dynamics, as the transform evaluates the contribution of all frequencies inherent to the system’s natural response.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
