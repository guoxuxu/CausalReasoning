  "Problem": "Analyze the effect on signal transduction in a linear time-invariant (LTI) system characterized by a convolution operation with an impulse response function \\\\( h(t) \\\\). This study involves examining the introduction of a Fourier transform of the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) transformed by a function \\\\( F(w) \\\\) and its implications on the system's output, \\\\( y(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) of the system, can we unambiguously determine the original input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without knowing whether a Fourier transform \\\\( F(w) \\\\) was applied to it?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( F(w) \\\\) changes the spectrum of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) in a way that might not be discernible solely from observing \\\\( y(t) \\\\), especially without additional information about the transformation characteristics of \\\\( F(w) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The original input signal x(t) directly influences the system's output y(t), and the Fourier transform F(w) of the input signal also directly influences the system's output y(t)."
