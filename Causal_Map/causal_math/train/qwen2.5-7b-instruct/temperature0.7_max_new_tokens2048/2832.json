  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow system governed by the Navier-Stokes equations in a two-dimensional region. Suppose the velocity field is represented as \\\\( \\\\vec{u} = (u(x, y, t), v(x, y, t)) \\\\) and governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\vec{u}}{\\\\partial t} + (\\\\vec{u} \\\\cdot \\\\nabla)\\\\vec{u} = -\\\\nabla p + \\\\nu \\\\nabla^2 \\\\vec{u} \\\\), where \\\\( p \\\\) is pressure and \\\\( \\\\nu \\\\) is the viscosity. An external force \\\\( \\\\vec{f} = (f_x(x,y,t), f_y(x,y,t)) \\\\) can be controlled as an intervention.\n\nBy examining the velocity field at \\\\( t = T \\\\), can we determine whether any external force was applied and the details of such an intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The velocity field at time \\\\( T \\\\) can be influenced by numerous factors including initial conditions, fluid viscosity, and potentially multiple ways that external forces could have been applied. As such, there is inherent ambiguity in back-calculating to find specific details about the intervention purely from the final state.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "External forces f_x and f_y directly affect the velocity components u and v respectively; changes in velocity over time (∂u/∂t) and convective acceleration ((u⋅∇)u) influence the velocity field; pressure gradient (∇p) and viscous diffusion (ν∇²u) also contribute to velocity changes."
