  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation represented by matrix \\\\( M \\\\) and a function \\\\( h(x) = Mx \\\\). Let's introduce a complex transformation represented by \\\\( p(x) = e^{i \\\\theta}x \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a constant real number. Analyze the behavior of a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) within this framework.\n\nGiven the final state after both transformations, \\\\( q = e^{i \\\\theta}Mx_0 \\\\), can we uniquely determine \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without knowing the sequence of transformations applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\\\( q \\\\), and known the transformations and their dependencies being linear and scalar multiplication, one can algebraically solve for \\\\( x_0 \\\\) irrespective of the order in which the transformations were applied. This inverse operation would involve applying the inverse transformations in the reverse order.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial vector x_0 is transformed by matrix M to produce Mx_0, then Mx_0 is further transformed by the phase factor e^(iθ) to yield e^(iθ)Mx_0, which is equal to q. The original vector x_0 can be uniquely determined from q if and only if both M and θ are known."
