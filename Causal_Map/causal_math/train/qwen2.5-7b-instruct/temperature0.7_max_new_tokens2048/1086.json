  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane which is governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) a real constant. We examine the effect of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant, on this function over time t.\n\nHaving observed \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we accurately determine the initial function value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing if the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, we cannot accurately backtrack to the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) since the amplitude scaling factor \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) would lead to different potential initial states depending upon its presence or absence.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The constant ω directly causes the derivative z'(t) of z with respect to time t. The constant α directly causes the transformation h(z). Time t directly causes both z(t) and h(z). The initial value z(0) directly causes z(T). The transformation h(z) directly causes z(T)."
