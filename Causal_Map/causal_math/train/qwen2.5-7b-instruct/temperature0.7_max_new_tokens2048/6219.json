  "Problem": "Evaluate how the Laplace Transform impacts the causality between a pair of functions \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\), where \\( v(t) = t^2 \\) and \\( u(t) \\) is its derivative using the relation \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f'(t)\\} = sF(s) - f(0) \\), where \\( F(s) \\) is the Laplace Transform of \\( f(t) \\).\n\nIf \\( u(t) = 2t \\) undergoes a linear transformation by a matrix \\( A \\) before its Laplace Transform is computed, does \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{Au(t)\\} \\) only reflect the properties of matrix \\( A \\) without relating to the original \\( v(t) = t^2 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{Au(t)\\} \\) will still inherently carry information about the original function \\( v(t) \\) because it's derived from \\( u(t) \\), reflecting the derivatives of \\( v(t) \\). The matrix \\( A \\) conditions the output but doesn't isolate \\( v(t)'s \\) influence.",
