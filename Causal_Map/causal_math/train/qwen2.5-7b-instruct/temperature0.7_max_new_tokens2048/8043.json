  "Problem": "Consider a complex plane transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The differential equation governing the dynamics is \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\lambda z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be influenced by the initial application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), the system's inherent dynamics under \\\\( -i\\\\lambda \\\\), and the intervention \\\\( g(z) \\\\). Specifically, \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can be represented as \\\\( e^{-i\\\\lambda (T - t_1)} e^{i\\\\theta} e^{-i\\\\lambda t_1} e^{i\\\\omega t_1} z_0 \\\\), showing dependencies on all parameters.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The final state z(T) depends on λ but not on ω or θ because the dynamics are governed by the differential equation derived from dz/dt = -iλz, which isolates z's evolution to a factor of λ, while f(z) and g(z) only transform z without affecting the underlying dynamics."
