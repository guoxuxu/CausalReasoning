  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\( u_t + xu_x = 0 \\), where \\( u(t, x) \\) is a function of time \\( t \\) and space \\( x \\). Investigate the effect of the Fourier transform \\( \\hat{u}(t, \\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-i\\xi x}u(t, x)dx \\) on the system over time.\n\nGiven the transformed state \\( \\hat{u}(T, \\xi) \\), can we determine if the modification \\( e^{i\\xi^2t} \\) was applied, by solely knowing \\( \\hat{u}(T, \\xi) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome \\( \\hat{u}(T, \\xi) \\) could result from multiple potential transformations or natural evolutions, considering the possibilities of similar effects from different interventions or initial conditions. The non-trivial relationship between the transformations and the original PDE complicates tracing back to specific interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The change in \\( u \\) with respect to time (\\( u_t \\)) directly causes the change in \\( u \\) with respect to space (\\( u_x \\)). The Fourier transform of \\( u(t, x) \\) leads to the transformed state \\( \\hat{u}(t, \\xi) \\), which then modifies to \\( e^{i\\xi^2t} \\hat{u}(t, \\xi) \\) to produce the modified state. Knowing the modified state at time \\( T \\) allows us to determine if the modification \\( e^{i\\xi^2t} \\) was applied."
