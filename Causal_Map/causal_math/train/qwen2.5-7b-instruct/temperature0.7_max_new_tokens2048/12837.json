  "Problem": "Consider a system of coupled harmonic oscillators whose state is described by the vector function \\\\(\\\\vec{z}(t)\\\\). The evolution over time is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{\\\\vec{z}} = M\\\\vec{z}\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We investigate the system's behavior under the Fourier transform, defined as \\\\( F(\\\\vec{z})(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\omega t}\\\\vec{z}(t) dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the time-evolved state \\\\( \\\\vec{z}(t) \\\\) at some t > 0, is it possible to ascertain whether the initial state was subjected to the Fourier transform, assuming no additional information on initial conditions or state transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific information about the application of the Fourier transform or the initial conditions, the observed state \\\\( \\\\vec{z}(t) \\\\) may result from various spectral distributions at t = 0 due to the non-invertibility and time-domain effects of the matrix M.",
