  "Problem": "Consider a complex differential system governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex function and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The investigation involves examining the effects of the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ z(t) \\\\} = Z(s) \\\\) and its impact over the function transformation through \\\\\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention through another function \\\\( g(t) = e^{bt} \\\\) (where \\\\( b \\\\) is a real constant) is applied, will the final result observed in the Laplace Transform for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) depend only on the original \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( a \\\\) or \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(t) = e^{bt} \\\\) modifies the ongoing state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), hence complicating the resulting Laplace Transform. The final transform will involve impacts from both \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), modifying frequency, decay rate, and other characteristics in the complex plane, making the final state dependent on all parameters.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of z with respect to time (dz/dt) is directly caused by iω, and applying an intervention through g(t) affects z(t), which in turn influences the Laplace Transform Z(s). The final result in Z(s) for t > t1 depends on iω and g(t) but not on b or any other external variable."
