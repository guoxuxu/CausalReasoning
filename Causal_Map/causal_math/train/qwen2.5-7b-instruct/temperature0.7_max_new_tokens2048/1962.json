  "Problem": "Analyze the system governed by a linear time-invariant differential operator \\\\( L \\\\) operating on a function \\\\( u(t) \\\\), and consider the effects of an integral transformation \\\\( T[u(t)] = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} u(t) dt \\\\). Assume \\\\( L[u(t)] = -u''(t) + 3u'(t) - 2u(t) \\\\), and study the Laplace transform effects.\n\nGiven the transformed outcome \\\\( T[u(t)] \\\\), can one uniquely determine \\\\( u(t) \\\\) without prior knowledge of its functional form or parameters?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T[u(t)] \\\\) compresses information into a different domain (s-domain), making it difficult or impossible to recover all specific details about \\\\( u(t) \\\\), especially if the original function includes non-exponential components that nullify under the transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The linear time-invariant differential operator L transforms the function u(t) into L[u(t)], which is then transformed by the integral transformation T into T[u(t)]. Conversely, the function u(t) is directly caused by the inverse operation of applying the operator L and the transformation T."
