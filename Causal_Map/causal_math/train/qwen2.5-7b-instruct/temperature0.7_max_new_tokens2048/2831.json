  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow system governed by the Navier-Stokes equations in a two-dimensional region. Suppose the velocity field is represented as \\\\( \\\\vec{u} = (u(x, y, t), v(x, y, t)) \\\\) and governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\vec{u}}{\\\\partial t} + (\\\\vec{u} \\\\cdot \\\\nabla)\\\\vec{u} = -\\\\nabla p + \\\\nu \\\\nabla^2 \\\\vec{u} \\\\), where \\\\( p \\\\) is pressure and \\\\( \\\\nu \\\\) is the viscosity. An external force \\\\( \\\\vec{f} = (f_x(x,y,t), f_y(x,y,t)) \\\\) can be controlled as an intervention.\n\nIf an external force \\\\( \\\\vec{f} \\\\) is applied at time \\\\( t = t_1 \\\\) and continued until time \\\\( T \\\\), does the final velocity field \\\\( \\\\vec{u}(x, y, T) \\\\) depend only on the applied force and not on the initial conditions or viscosity?",
  "Explanation": "While the external force will significantly influence the evolution and state of the velocity field at time \\\\( T \\\\), the outcome still depends on the initial conditions and the fluid properties such as viscosity, along with how these factors interact with the force applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
