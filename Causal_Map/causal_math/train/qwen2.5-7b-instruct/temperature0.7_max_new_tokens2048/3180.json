  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system defined by the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\), where D is a matrix representing system dynamics. We explore the impact of applying the Laplace transform \\( L \\{x(t)\\} \\), and then modifying this transform with a filter defined by the function \\( H(s) \\), where s is the complex frequency variable.\n\nKnowing the final state \\( x(T) \\) and the initial condition \\( x_0 \\), is it possible to determine exactly which filters (whether \\( H(s) \\), \\( J(s) \\), or both) were applied during the interval from t = 0 to T?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\( x(T) \\) resulting from linear transformations and filtering can be derived from different combinations of \\( H(s) \\) and \\( J(s) \\). The non-uniqueness of the filters' spectral effects means multiple filter configurations could yield the same \\( x(T) \\), making it impossible to pinpoint the exact filters used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the Laplace transform to x(t) results in X(s), which, when modified by the filter H(s), leads to Y(s). Y(s) is then transformed back into y(t). The initial condition x_0 and the final state x(T) influence X(s), which in turn affects the output y(t) through the filter H(s)."
