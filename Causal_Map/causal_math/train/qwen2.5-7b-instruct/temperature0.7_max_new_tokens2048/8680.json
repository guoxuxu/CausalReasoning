  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by a Laplace transform \\\\( L\\{f(t)\\} = F(s) \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) undergoes a Fourier transformation. Analyzing the behavior between the Laplacian and Fourier transformations of the function as it manifests in the complex domain.\n\nCan we isolate and determine the individual transformations (Fourier and convolution) applied to \\\\( f(t) \\\\) solely by analyzing the final representation in the s-domain?",
  "Explanation": "The combinatorial effect of Fourier transformation and convolution produces a result that does not separately encode the signatures of each operation distinctly enough to dismantle them purely by observing the s-domain output. These operations modify the function's attributes in an intertwined manner.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
