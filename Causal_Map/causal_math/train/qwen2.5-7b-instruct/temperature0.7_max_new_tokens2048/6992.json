  "Problem": "Consider the heat equation \\( u_t = \\Delta u \\) governing the temperature field \\( u \\) over a domain, affected by an external heat source modulated by the function \\( h(t, x) = e^{-\\lambda t} \\sin(\\omega x) \\), where \\( \\lambda \\) and \\( \\omega \\) are constants.\n\nKnowing only the temperature profile \\( u(x, T) \\) at some final time \\( T \\), can we determine accurately whether the initial source was \\( h(t, x) \\) or whether an intervention with \\( k(t, x) \\) occurred?",
  "Explanation": "The ambiguities arising from potential changes in the source functions and the inherent properties of partial differential equations make it impossible to infer uniquely whether \\( h(t, x) \\) or \\( k(t, x) \\) or both were acting throughout the time period, based solely on the final state \\( u(x, T) \\). Temperature profiles can be similar despite different influences due to the diffusive nature and thermal equivalences in the responses.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
