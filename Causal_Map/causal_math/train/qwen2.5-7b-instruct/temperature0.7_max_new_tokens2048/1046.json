  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator L acting on a space of functions, with the Fourier transform being used to transform these functions. An operator \\\\(M\\\\) modifies the function using transformation \\\\(Mf(x) = f(x-c)\\\\), where \\\\(c\\\\) is a constant. We examine how the spectrum of the functions is affected over the transformation by \\\\(M\\\\).\n\nIf a shifted spectrum is observed, can we infer the exact value of the constant \\\\(c\\\\) used in the transformation \\\\(Mf(x)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While a shift in the spectrum indicates a transformation of the form \\\\(f(x) \\\\mapsto f(x-c)\\\\), determining the exact value of \\\\(c\\\\) solely from the spectrum shift is ambiguous without additional information (like phase details), as multiple values could theoretically result in a similar spectral shift.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The constant c in the transformation Mf(x) = f(x-c) directly causes the shift in the spectrum. The spectrum is shifted due to the transformation Mf(x), and the value of c determines the magnitude and direction of the shift."
