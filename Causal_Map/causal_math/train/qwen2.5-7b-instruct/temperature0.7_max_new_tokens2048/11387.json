  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^z \\\\) and its effect on the integral transformation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} f(z) e^{-zt} dz \\\\). Let \\\\( z = x + yi \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are real numbers, and \\\\( t \\\\) is a real positive parameter.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by applying a transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^2 e^z \\\\), will the final form of \\\\( y(t) \\\\) still depend solely on the original function?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by applying \\\\( z^2 \\\\) modifies the function from which the integral is computed. The quadratically scaled variable \\\\( z^2 \\\\) additionally alters the integral's convergence behavior and thus affects \\\\( y(t) \\\\), making the outcome dependent on both the original and the transformed function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
