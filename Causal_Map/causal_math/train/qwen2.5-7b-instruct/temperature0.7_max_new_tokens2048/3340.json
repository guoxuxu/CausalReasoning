  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 v = 0\\\\) in a domain \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\). Assess the effect of the boundary condition alteration defined through \\\\( v' = v + h \\\\) on the boundary \\\\(\\\\Gamma\\\\), where \\\\(h\\\\) is a known function defined on \\\\(\\\\Gamma\\\\).\n\nGiven the final state \\\\(v''(x)\\\\) in the domain \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\), can one conclusively identify whether boundaries were modified once as \\\\(v'\\\\) or twice as \\\\(v''\\\\) based solely on observation of the final function?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the sequence or number of interventions on boundary conditions exclusively from the final state \\\\(v''(x)\\\\) is not feasible. Multiple pathways of interventions may lead to similar or such undistinguishable solutions that disambiguating them from the end state alone is impossible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The change in boundary condition through h directly causes a modification in the boundary value v', which in turn directly causes a change in the final state v'' in the domain Ω."
