  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace Transform of a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( H(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(h(t))(s) \\\\). We explore the implications of modifying the transform by a multiplication factor \\\\( e^{-as} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant, on the inverse transformation and how it impacts the original time-domain function.\n\nIf the Laplace Transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is modified by multiplying with \\\\( e^{-as} \\\\), and then the inverse Laplace Transform is applied, does the resulting function \\\\( h'(t) \\\\) differ from the original function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) by a time shift of \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying the Laplace Transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\) by \\\\( e^{-as} \\\\) corresponds to a time shift of the original function \\\\( h(t) \\\\). Specifically, \\\\( H(s) e^{-as} \\\\) transforms back to \\\\( h(t-a)u(t-a) \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) is the Heaviside step function. This is a time shift and truncation at \\\\( t=a \\\\).",
