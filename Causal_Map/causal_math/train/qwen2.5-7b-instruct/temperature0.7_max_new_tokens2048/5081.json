  "Problem": "Consider a series of kinematic equations \\\\(\\\\vec{x}(t) = \\\\vec{x}_0 + \\\\vec{v}_0t + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\vec{a}t^2\\\\) in a physics simulation space, where \\\\(\\\\vec{a}\\\\) is the acceleration vector. Analyze how applying a transformation matrix \\\\( M \\\\) that scales and rotates the initial velocity \\\\(\\\\vec{v}_0\\\\) affects the position vector \\\\(\\\\vec{x}(t)\\\\) over time.\n\nIf the transformation matrix \\\\( M \\\\) is applied to the initial velocity \\\\(\\\\vec{v}_0\\\\) at t = 0 and the system evolves under the kinematic equations without further intervention, will the position \\\\(\\\\vec{x}(t)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\(\\\\vec{v}_0\\\\) was evolved directly to t = T under the original equations?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the transformation matrix \\\\( M \\\\) to \\\\(\\\\vec{v}_0\\\\) changes the initial velocity, which directly influences the linear term of the position equation. This modified initial velocity results in a different trajectory, leading to a position vector \\\\(\\\\vec{x}(t)\\\\) at time T that differs from the trajectory without applying \\\\( M \\\\).",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying transformation matrix M to initial velocity v_0 produces transformed velocity v'_0, which then influences the position x'(t) through the kinematic equation. The acceleration a directly causes the position x(t). Both v'_0 and v_0 evolve to x(T) under their respective kinematic equations."
