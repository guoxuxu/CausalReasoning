  "Problem": "Consider the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k \\\\Delta u \\\\) in a domain \\\\( D \\\\) with boundary conditions prescribed on \\\\( \\\\partial D \\\\). An input function \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\) represents the external heat added per unit time. We consider the impact of the integral transformation \\\\( T[u](x,t) = u(x,t) + \\\\int_0^t h(x, \\\\tau) \\\\, d\\\\tau \\\\) on the system over time t.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional heat source \\\\( j(x,t) \\\\) starts influencing the system through the transformation \\\\( G[u](x,t) = u(x,t) + \\\\int_{t_1}^t j(x, \\\\tau) \\\\, d\\\\tau \\\\), will the final temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of the heat input \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\) and depend solely on \\\\( j(x,t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\) and \\\\( j(x,t) \\\\) contribute to the overall heat input, affecting the temperature distribution over time. The final state \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) is influenced by the cumulative effect of both heat sources; therefore, it depends on both, not just \\\\( j(x,t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial heat input h(x,t) influences the temperature distribution u(x,t) until t_1, after which the new heat source j(x,t) influences the temperature through G[u](x,t) up to time T, making u(x,T) dependent on both h(x,t) before t_1 and j(x,t) from t_1 onwards."
