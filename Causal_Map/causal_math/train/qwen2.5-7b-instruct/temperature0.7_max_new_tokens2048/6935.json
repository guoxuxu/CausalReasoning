  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\), where \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\( z \\), respectively. The evolution of \\( z \\) is governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = Mz \\), where \\( M \\) is a constant matrix. We analyze the impact of the integral transformation defined by \\( f(z) = \\int_0^t e^{Ns} z(s) \\, ds \\), where \\( N \\) is another constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), a new function \\( g(z) = \\int_{t_1}^T e^{Qs} z(s) \\, ds \\) (where \\( Q \\) is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) depend solely on \\( M \\) and not on \\( N \\) or \\( Q \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( g(z) \\) introduces another integral transformation that will affect the state at \\( t = T \\), contributing effects from \\( N \\), \\( Q \\), as well as \\( M \\). These transformations interact and overlap in complex ways, causing the final state to be influenced by all parameters.",
