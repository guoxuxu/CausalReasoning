  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = D\\\\Delta z\\\\), where D is a diffusion coefficient, and \\\\(\\\\Delta\\\\) is the Laplacian operator. We also introduce a transformation function \\\\(h(z) = \\\\int e^{-sD}z ds\\\\), assumed to act on the system at a specific point.\n\nGiven the observed endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we definitively ascertain the specifics of the interventions applied (whether \\\\(h(z)\\\\), \\\\(j(z)\\\\), or both) based on the final state alone?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple configurations of \\\\(h(z)\\\\) and \\\\(j(z)\\\\) could lead to the same or indistinguishably similar outcomes at \\\\(z(T)\\\\), especially given the non-linear and integral nature of \\\\(h(z)\\\\) and the additive nature of \\\\(j(z)\\\\). This ambiguity leaves room for multiple plausible paths that could have resulted in the observed final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
