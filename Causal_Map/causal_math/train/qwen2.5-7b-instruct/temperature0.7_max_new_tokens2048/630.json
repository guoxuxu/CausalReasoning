  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of an electrical system characterized by a complex impedance function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) in the Laplace domain, where \\\\( s \\\\) is the complex frequency. We explore the effect of applying a Laplace transform to the time-domain voltage function \\\\( v(t) = V_0 e^{at} \\\\), with \\\\( V_0 \\\\) and \\\\( a \\\\) being constants.\n\nFrom observing \\\\( I(s) \\\\) in the Laplace domain, can we uniquely determine the original function \\\\( v(t) \\\\) without knowing whether it was the result of a transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the Laplace transform for linear time-invariant systems is unique and reversible, knowing \\\\( I(s) \\\\) and provided with \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), one can uniquely determine \\\\( V(s) \\\\) and inversely transform it to retrieve \\\\( v(t) \\\\), even without prior knowledge of the specific transformation.",
