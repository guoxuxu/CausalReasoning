  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z \\) defined in the complex plane as \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant frequency. We study the effect of adding a linear transformation represented by \\( T(z) = az + b \\) (where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are complex constants) on the behavior of \\( z(t) \\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), a new transformation \\( U(z) = cz + d \\) (where \\( c \\) and \\( d \\) are complex constants) is applied as an intervention, will the behavior of \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depend only on \\( \\omega \\) and not on \\( a \\), \\( b \\), \\( c \\), or \\( d \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( U(z) \\) introduces additional factors that significantly modify the ensuing trajectory of \\( z(t) \\). The final state at \\( t = T \\) will depend on the initial constants \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) (from \\( T(z) \\)), as well as the new constants \\( c \\) and \\( d \\) introduced by \\( U(z) \\), affecting both amplitude and phase.",
