  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency. We examine how the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\) interacts with this dynamic over time.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is initially a simple exponential \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega_0 t} \\\\), and evolves under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without any intervention, will the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) be the same at any time T?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) being an exponential means its frequency content is static, centred at \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\). The evolution under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) does not change the frequency of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), thus leaving the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) \\\\) unchanged at any time T for the given frequency.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
