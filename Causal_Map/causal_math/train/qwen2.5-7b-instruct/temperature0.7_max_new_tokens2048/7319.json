  "Problem": "Analyze a system represented by the eigenfunction expansion \\\\( u(x, t) = \\\\sum_n a_n(t) \\\\phi_n(x) \\\\), where \\\\( a_n(t) \\\\) are the time-dependent coefficients and \\\\( \\\\phi_n(x) \\\\) are the eigenfunctions. An operation \\\\( F(u) \\\\) is defined as applying a differential operator, specifically \\\\( F(u) = -\\\\frac{d^2u}{dx^2} + cu \\\\), where c is a constant.\n\nIf during the evolution at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new operation \\\\( G(u) = u + d \\\\) (where d is a constant) is applied, will the resultant function at time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on the initial application of \\\\( F \\\\) and not on \\\\( G \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( G(u) \\\\) adds a constant to the whole function, altering its subsequent evolution. This change affects how the coefficients \\\\( a_n(t) \\\\) evolve post-\\\\( t_1 \\\\), hence, the final state at \\\\( T \\\\) depends on both the initial effect of \\\\( F \\\\) and the mid-way intervention of \\\\( G \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
