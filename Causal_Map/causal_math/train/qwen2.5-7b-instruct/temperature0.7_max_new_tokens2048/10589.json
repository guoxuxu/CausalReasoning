  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by an integro-differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} + p(t)y = \\\\int_0^t k(s) y(s) ds \\\\), where p(t) and k(t) are given functions of time. We examine the effect of a Fourier transform applied at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), with a transform function \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\omega t} y(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) is calculated for \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and then \\\\( y(t) \\\\) evolves per the given integro-differential equation without any intervention, will \\\\( y(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > 0 \\\\) exactly reflect the initial \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) calculated?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) represents the frequency domain characterization of the initial state of \\\\( y(t) \\\\). The evolution as described by the integro-differential equation significantly alters \\\\( y(t) \\\\) by integrating its past values and interacting it with \\\\( p(t) \\\\). Since this changes the initial characteristics calculated by \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\), \\\\( y(T) \\\\) will not reflect the initial \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\).",
