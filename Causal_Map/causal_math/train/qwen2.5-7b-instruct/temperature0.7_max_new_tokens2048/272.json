  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\) governed by the Cauchy-Riemann equations which ensure its differentiability in the complex plane. We examine the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under the effects of an integral transform \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At}z(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nGiven the modified endpoint function at time T, can we determine precisely what transformations (\\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( D(z) \\\\), or both) were applied, solely based on the function at T?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of complex coefficients and the overlapping effects of the differential and integral transformations obscure the exact sequence or type of transformations applied. Changes influenced by \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) can manifest similarly or mask one another, leading to ambiguity regarding the historical transformations applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
