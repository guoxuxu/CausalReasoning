  "Problem": "Consider a discrete-time system governed by the equation \\\\( x_{n+1} = f(x_n) \\\\\\), where \\\\( f(x) = A x \\\\) with A being a square matrix. We also use a linear operator \\\\( T(x) = B x \\\\), where B is another square matrix, to transform the initial state.\n\nIf we apply \\\\( T(x) \\\\) to an initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and subsequently let the system evolve according to \\\\( x_{n+1} = f(x_n) \\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( x_N \\\\) at time step N be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to step N under the same system equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( T(x) \\\\) modifies the initial state to \\\\( B x_0 \\\\). The new trajectory starting from \\\\( B x_0 \\\\) is evolved by repeated applications of A, resulting in \\\\( A^N B x_0 \\\\). This differs from \\\\( A^N x_0 \\\\) unless A and B commute.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the linear operator T to the initial state x_0 results in x_1, which then evolves to x_2 according to the system equation. Without further application of T, the state x_N will differ from directly evolving x_0 to step N."
