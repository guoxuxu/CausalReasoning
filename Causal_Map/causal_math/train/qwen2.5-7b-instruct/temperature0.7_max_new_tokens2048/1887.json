  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) over a rod of length L is governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), with \\\\( k \\\\) being the thermal diffusivity constant. We explore the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) and analyze its effects over time.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new heat source is introduced as an intervention, changing the system according to a Dirac delta function added at a specific point, will the endpoint \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the initial Fourier transformed condition and not on the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the new heat source introduces a significant localized change in the temperature profile, affecting the diffusion process. This makes the final distribution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) dependent not only on the initial Fourier transformed condition but also significantly on the intervention applied at \\\\( t_1 \\\\).",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial temperature distribution u(x,0) influences the temperature distribution u(x,t) through its Fourier transform U(k,0), which then evolves over time to U(k,t). The Dirac delta intervention at t_1 affects u(x,t) directly but does not override the influence of the initial Fourier transform U(k,0) on u(x,t) for T > t_1."
