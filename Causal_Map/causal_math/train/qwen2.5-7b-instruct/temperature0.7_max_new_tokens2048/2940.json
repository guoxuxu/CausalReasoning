  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + p(x) \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( p(x) \\\\) is a position-dependent velocity field. We analyze the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at a specific time.\n\nGiven the Fourier transform of \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at some time \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), \\\\( \\\\mathcal{G} \\\\), or both), only by knowing the transformed values?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping effects of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\mathcal{G} \\\\) on the Fourier transform, as well as the continuous evolution under the PDE, make it difficult to uniquely determine which transformations or interventions were applied at earlier stages.",
