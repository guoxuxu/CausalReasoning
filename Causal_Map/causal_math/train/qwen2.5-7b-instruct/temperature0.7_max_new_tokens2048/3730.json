  "Problem": "Consider the transformation of the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, transformed by \\\\( f(z) = e^{iAt} z \\\\) over time t, where A is a real constant. This represents a rotation in the complex plane.\n\nGiven the observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) in the complex plane at some time T, can one deduce the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing the value of A?",
  "Explanation": "The effect, \\\\( z(T) = e^{iAT} z_0 \\\\), depends critically on A. Without knowledge of A, one cannot determine the angle of rotation and therefore cannot reliably compute the inverse transformation to find \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
