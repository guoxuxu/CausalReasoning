  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system where the evolution is governed by \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = P(z)\\\\), with P being a polynomial in z. Analyze the impact of a Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) on this system, defined by the function \\\\(g(z, s) = e^{-st}z\\\\) for a complex variable s.\n\nIf an intervention is made by applying another transformation, say \\\\(h(z, u) = z + u\\\\) where u is a constant, at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the system's state at \\\\(T\\\\) exclusively depend on P without being affected by the initial Laplace transform s?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the trajectory anew, and the final state at \\\\(T\\\\) will depend on the initial parameter s from the Laplace transform due to how these transformations integrate with the evolution under P. Thus, the trajectory ultimately depends on both s and the intervention u.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of z over time is driven by P(z), which is unaffected by the initial Laplace transform parameter s. Applying h(z, u) introduces a constant shift to z but does not alter the fundamental dynamics governed by P(z)."
