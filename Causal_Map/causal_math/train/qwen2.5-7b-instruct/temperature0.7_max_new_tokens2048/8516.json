  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\alpha z^2 \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency, and \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant. Analyze the implications of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = z e^{\\\\beta t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a complex constant, on the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time t.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) may result from various combinations of transformations and initial conditions affected by \\\\( \\\\alpha, \\\\beta, \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\). The complex interplay of these exponential transformations with the system’s non-linear dynamics makes it challenging to uniquely identify what specific transformations or interventions were applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The imaginary unit multiplied by omega directly influences the rate of change of z with respect to time. The complex constant alpha also directly influences the rate of change of z with respect to time. The complex constant beta influences the transformation f(z). The value of z at time T is determined by its initial conditions and the transformations applied. The transformation f(z) influences the value of z over time."
