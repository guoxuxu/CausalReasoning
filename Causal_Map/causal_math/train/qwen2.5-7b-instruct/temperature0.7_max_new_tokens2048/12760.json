  "Problem": "Consider a linear partial differential equation (PDE) governing a field \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) across space \\\\(x\\\\) and time \\\\(t\\\\), given by \\\\(\\\\partial u / \\\\partial t = L u\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a differential operator. We analyze the behavior of the field under the transformation \\\\(v(x,t) = T[u(x,t)]\\\\) where \\\\(T\\\\) involves applying an integral transformation such as the Laplace transform.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(T[u(x,0)]\\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\), and the field is evolved under the PDE without further intervention, will \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) at time \\\\(t = T\\\\) match the solution if the initial condition was not transformed?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(T[u(x,0)]\\\\) changes the initial state of the field, which in turn alters how the field evolves under the differential operator \\\\(L\\\\). The solution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) will be different due to the modified initial condition.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u(x,0) directly causes the field u(x,t) to evolve over time according to the PDE. Applying the transformation T to u(x,0) directly causes the field to become v(x,t). If no further intervention occurs, u(x,T) will match v(x,T) at time t=T."
