  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function f(z) where f is an analytic function of the complex variable z. We're examining the effect of two transformations on f: multiplication by e^z, and application of the Fourier Transform denoted as F.\n\nGiven the transformation result of a Fourier Transform applied to an e^z multiplied f(z), and knowing a latter intervention by g(z), can we deduce whether e^z or a different function was used initially on f(z)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of g(z) post Fourier Transform application complicates the identification of the original operational transformation on f(z). Various different starting functions, when subject to these transformations, can yield similar or non-unique end states, making it impossible to definitively discern the specific initial transformation used.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
