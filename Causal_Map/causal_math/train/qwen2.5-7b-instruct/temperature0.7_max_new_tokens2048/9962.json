  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real parameter representing angular frequency. The function describes a pure harmonic oscillation in the complex plane. Now, consider the transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowledge of \\\\( h(z) \\\\)'s application, can we accurately infer the original \\\\( z(0) \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) changes the frequency and overall behavior of the oscillation, observing just \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing about the transformation will not allow us to correctly backtrack to \\\\( z(0) \\\\), because we cannot determine whether or not harmonic frequency doubling occurred.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z at time 0 (z(0)) directly influences the value of z at time T (z(T)), but knowing z(T) alone does not allow us to uniquely determine z(0) due to the non-invertibility of the transformation z → z^2."
