  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on the complex plane \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) and its transformation via a Fourier transform, resulting in \\\\( g(w) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{zw} e^{-z^2 / 2} dz \\\\). Let's examine the effects of modifying the function in the frequency domain and then applying the inverse transformation to recover the signal in the time domain.\n\nIf an additional filtering operation (multiplication by a function \\\\( h(w) \\\\)) is applied in the frequency domain before performing the inverse Fourier transform, will the resultant time domain function remain unchanged from \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of a filter \\\\( h(w) \\\\) modifies the frequency components of the original function, which affects the time-domain representation of the signal after applying the inverse Fourier transform. Thus, the resultant time domain function will be an altered version of \\\\( f(z) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
