  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a function \\( u(x, t) \\) governed by the partial differential equation \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = -\\lambda u \\) with \\( \\lambda > 0 \\), and consider the transformation \\( T(u) = u e^{-\\lambda t} \\) applied to \\( u \\).\n\nCan we infer the initial state \\( u(x, 0) \\) from \\( u(x, T) \\) at some later time T, without knowing if \\( T(u) \\) was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the initial application of \\( T(u) \\), the transformation \\( e^{-\\lambda T} \\) can obscure the original state. The effect of \\( -\\lambda u \\) on \\( u \\) would exponentially decay the function, whereas implementing \\( T(u) \\) might initially preserve the state, creating ambiguity in reconstructing \\( u(x, 0) \\) from \\( u(x, T) \\) without additional information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of u(x, t) at any time t leads to the value of u(x, T) through the transformation T(u) = u * e^(-λt), and this transformation can be reversed to infer the initial state u(x, 0) from u(x, T) given λ and T."
