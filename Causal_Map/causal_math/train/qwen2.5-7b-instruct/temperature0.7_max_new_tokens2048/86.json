  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the wave equation \\\\( u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is the wave speed. We investigate the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx}u(x,t)dx \\\\) on the system and manipulating the transformed function.\n\nCan we uniquely determine the original state \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) from the state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) using the Fourier transform without knowing how the system was manipulated during [0,T]?",
  "Explanation": "If the system was manipulated or if there were any unknown interventions (such as changes in wave speed or additional forces), these factors could affect the evolution in a way that isn't recovered simply by observing \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) and applying a Fourier transform, due to potential non-linear interventions or changes in system parameters.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
