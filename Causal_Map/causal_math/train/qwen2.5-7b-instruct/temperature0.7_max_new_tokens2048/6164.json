  "Problem": "Examine a system characterized by the non-linear differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dx}{dt} = x^2 - 2x + 1 \\\\), and consider the impact of a transformation given by \\\\( g(x) = x + k \\\\) where k is a constant.\n\nCan we precisely determine what interventions were applied (whether \\\\( g(x) \\\\), \\\\( h(x) \\\\), or both), just by observing the state at \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple intervention sequences could lead to the same final state due to the non-linear properties and the addition/subtraction of a constant k, impacting trajectories differently. Thus, knowing only \\\\( x(T) \\\\) doesn't allow for unique identification of preceding interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of x at time t influences its value at time T. The transformation g(x) affects the value of x at a future time step."
