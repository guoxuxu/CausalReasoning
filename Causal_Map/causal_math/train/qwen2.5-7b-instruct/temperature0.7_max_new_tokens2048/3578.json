  "Problem": "Consider a domain in the complex plane where we evaluate the integral transformation \\\\( I(z) = \\\\int_C e^{zt} dt \\\\), with C being a contour in the complex plane. We explore the effect of varying the parameter z and modifying the contour C.\n\nGiven the output of the integral transformation at some z, can we identify the specific z used in the absence of contour C information?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the contour C, it is impossible to uniquely determine z since different contours could yield the same integral result for different values of z. The contour's shape and location greatly influence the integral's dependency on z.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z directly influences the output of the integral transformation I(z), and the contour C also directly influences the output of the integral transformation I(z)."
