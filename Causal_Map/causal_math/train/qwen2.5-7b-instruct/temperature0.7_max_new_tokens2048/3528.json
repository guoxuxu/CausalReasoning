  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t + u_{xx} = 0\\\\), where \\\\(u_t\\\\) and \\\\(u_{xx}\\\\) are the time and second space derivatives of \\\\(u\\\\), respectively. To study the problem, we use the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-ikx} u(x,t)dx\\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions (either initial Fourier transformed state or modifications at \\\\(t_1\\\\)) were used, calculated only by knowing \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the transformations and potential interventions affecting the spatial and modal compositions, the endpoint \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) could result from various initial and modified states, making it impossible to determine uniquely the specific interventions or initial conditions applied.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial Fourier transformed state directly causes hat{u}(k,t_1), which then influences hat{u}(k,T) through the evolution described by the partial differential equation. u(x,t) changes over time to produce u_t and u_xx, which are related to hat{u}(k,t) via the Fourier transform."
