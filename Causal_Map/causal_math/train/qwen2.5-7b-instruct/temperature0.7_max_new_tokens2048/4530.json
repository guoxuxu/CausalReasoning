  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), which evolves over time according to the Schrödinger-like equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz\\\\), where A is a constant matrix and i represents the imaginary unit. An intervention is defined by the transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{Bt}z\\\\), where B is another constant matrix different from A.\n\nCan we precisely infer \\\\(z_0\\\\) from \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at any time t given the action \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz\\\\), but without confirmation if function \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The lack of knowledge about whether or not \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied introduces uncertainty in backtracking to the original \\\\(z_0\\\\). Differentiating whether the evolution was purely from \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz\\\\) or altered by \\\\(e^{Bt}\\\\) impacts the ability to precisely deduce the initial state since both A and B affect the development of z.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of z(t) is governed by the Schrödinger-like equation, where the rate of change of z depends on the constant matrix A. The transformation f(z) depends on the matrix B."
