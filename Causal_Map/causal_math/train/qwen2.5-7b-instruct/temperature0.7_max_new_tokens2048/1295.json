  "Problem": "Given a linear operator L operating on a space of functions, consider how the Fourier transform interacts with differential operators. Let L be defined specifically for a function u(x) such that Lu = -u''(x) where ' denotes the derivative with respect to x.\n\nIf an additional operator M, such that \\( Mu = e^{Ax}u \\) where A is a constant matrix, is applied as an intervention at time t_1, will the ultimate form of \\( u(T) \\), for T > t_1, depend only on the original operator L?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of a new operator M as an intervention introduces exponential growth terms determined by A along with the differential properties of L, configuring both growth and diffusion components into \\( u(T) \\). Thus, the outcome at T > t_1 now reflects the interplay and combined effect of L and M.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the operator M at time t_1 changes the form of u(x) which then influences u(T) for T > t_1; the operator L alone does not determine u(T) if M has intervened."
