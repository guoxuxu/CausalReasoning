  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Schrödinger equation for a quantum particle in a potential, \\\\( i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial t} = -\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m}\\\\nabla^2 \\\\psi + V(x) \\\\psi \\\\), where \\\\( V(x) \\\\) is the potential energy function. We investigate the effect of applying a transformation represented by a unitary operator \\\\( U(t) = e^{-iHt/\\\\hbar} \\\\), where H is a Hamiltonian operator.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( U(t) \\\\), \\\\( V(t) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\) might result from various combinations of interventions due to the superposition principle in quantum mechanics and the non-commutative properties of the exponential operators used in \\\\( U(t) \\\\) and \\\\( V(t) \\\\). Without additional information, it is impossible to uniquely determine which interventions were applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of a unitary operator U(t) and the potential energy function V(x) both influence the state of the quantum particle ψ(T) at time T. Conversely, knowing ψ(T) allows us to infer the effects of U(t) and V(x) on the system."
