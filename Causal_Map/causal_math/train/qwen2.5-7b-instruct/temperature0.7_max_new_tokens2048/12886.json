  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) mapping from time \\\\( t \\\\) in the complex plane to a complex number \\\\( z \\\\). The transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied to process the output at different times.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(z) = z + 1 \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the state at \\\\( t = T \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) only depend on the original transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) and not on the interventions (\\\\( g(z) \\\\) or \\\\( h(z) \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions with \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) = z + 1 \\\\) introduce additional factors affecting the state at time \\\\( t = T \\\\). Both modifications (square and addition) significantly impact the trajectory and the resultant output at \\\\( t = T \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Time t influences the state z through the transformation z(t), which is then processed by g(z) and h(z) depending on whether t is before or after t_1. For t > t_1, the state z(T) depends on both g(z) and h(z)."
