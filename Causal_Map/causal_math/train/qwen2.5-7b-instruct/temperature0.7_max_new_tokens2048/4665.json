  "Problem": "Consider a physical scenario where heat propagation in a rod is modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal conductivity. We analyze the system's response to a time-dependent boundary condition \\\\( u(0,t) = e^{-\\lambda t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nIf the boundary condition \\\\( u(0,t) = e^{-\\lambda t} \\\\) is applied at one end of the rod at t = 0 and the system is allowed to evolve according to the heat equation \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\) without further intervention, will the heat distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) at a later time t > 0 be solely determined by this initial boundary condition?",
  "Explanation": "The boundary condition initiates a specific thermal gradient along the rod that evolves according to the heat equation. Given the condition at one boundary and assuming initial conditions elsewhere (e.g., initially uniform temperature), the solution to the heat equation at any subsequent time is uniquely determined by this boundary condition.",
