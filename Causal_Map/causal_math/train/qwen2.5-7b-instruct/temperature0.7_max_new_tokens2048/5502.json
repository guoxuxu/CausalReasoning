  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t. Let's define a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number.\n\nKnowing the transformed function \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we infer the original function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) at t=0 without knowing whether transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), any attempt to deduce \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be indeterminate since the factor \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega T} \\\\) ambiguously scales and rotates the original values of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) in a way that cannot be uniquely reversed without additional information.",
