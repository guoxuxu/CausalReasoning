  "Problem": "Consider a complex system represented by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant indicating the angular frequency. The behavior of the system under two different types of transformations, the Laplace transform \\\\(L\\\\) and its inverse \\\\(L^{-1}\\\\) is examined over time.\n\nCan the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be deduced at t = 0 after applying \\\\(L^{-1}\\\\) to \\\\(z(t)\\\\) observed at t = T without knowing whether \\\\(L\\\\) was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Laplace transform is designed to retrieve time-domain functions from their transformation in the frequency domain, allowing recovery of the original function assuming no additional transformations or alterations occurred.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
