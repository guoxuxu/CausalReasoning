  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where a signal \\( x(t) \\) undergoes a Fourier transform to produce \\( X(f) \\), which is then altered by a transfer function \\( H(f) \\) and subsequently inverse Fourier transformed to generate \\( y(t) \\).\n\nGiven \\( y(t) \\), can we unequivocally infer \\( x(t) \\) without knowing \\( H(f) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing \\( H(f) \\), it's impossible to accurately deduce \\( x(t) \\) from \\( y(t) \\) because the transformation \\( H(f) \\) could modify \\( X(f) \\) in ways that cannot be reverse-engineered without precise knowledge of \\( H(f) \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The signal x(t) is transformed into X(f) via the Fourier transform, X(f) is modified by the transfer function H(f) to produce y(t), and H(f) also directly influences y(t)."
