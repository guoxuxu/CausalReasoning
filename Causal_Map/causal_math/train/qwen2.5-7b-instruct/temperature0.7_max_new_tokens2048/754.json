  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a Laplace transform \\\\( L\\{f(t)\\} = F(s) \\\\) relating a time-domain function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to its s-domain representation. The causal effect of modifying the system's response by applying a convolution with another function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) (whose Laplace transform is \\\\( G(s) \\\\)) is studied.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\) of the response \\\\( h(t) = f(t) * g(t) \\\\), can we uniquely determine \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and \\\\( G(s) \\\\) without prior knowledge of either \\\\( f(t) \\\\) or \\\\( g(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "If we only know \\\\( H(s) = F(s)G(s) \\\\), there are potentially multiple pairs \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and \\\\( G(s) \\\\) that could result in the given \\\\( H(s) \\\\). Without additional information such as initial conditions or boundary conditions, or constraints on \\\\( F(s) \\\\) or \\\\( G(s) \\\\), it's impossible to unambiguously decompose \\\\( H(s) \\\\) into its factors.",
