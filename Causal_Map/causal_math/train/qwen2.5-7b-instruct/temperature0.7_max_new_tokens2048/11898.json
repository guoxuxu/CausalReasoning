  "Problem": "Consider a complex function in the form of \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\) where x is a constant complex vector and A is a constant real matrix. We assess the behavior of the function after applying a Laplace transform, defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z(t)) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf, at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an external vector function \\\\( y = e^{-Bt}w \\\\) (where B is a constant matrix and w a constant vector) is added, will the resulting transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) for s > 0 purely depend on A and ignore the effects of B?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( y = e^{-Bt}w \\\\) introduces an additional term to z(t), which affects the overall Laplace transform. The resulting transform function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) will depend both on A and B due to the additive nature of the functions in the time domain affecting the frequency domain representation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of A directly influences Z(s) through the original function z(t), while B indirectly affects it via the added function y(t), but this effect is mediated through Y(s) and thus does not solely determine Z(s)."
