  "Problem": "Consider a multi-dimensional complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant matrix and \\\\( x \\\\) is a complex initial vector. The function undergoes an integral transformation defined by \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nIf at a certain \\\\( s_1 \\\\), an intervention modifies \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) to \\\\( Z(s) + e^{Bs} \\\\) where \\\\( B \\\\) is another complex matrix, will the new \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) for \\\\( s > s_1 \\\\) solely depend on the properties of \\\\( B \\\\) and not \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The added term \\\\( e^{Bs} \\\\) introduces an overlap of exponential terms in the s-domain, making the resultant transformed function dependent on both matrices \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\). The complex function dynamics and the integral transform properties ensure the interactions between these matrices' effects are intertwined.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
