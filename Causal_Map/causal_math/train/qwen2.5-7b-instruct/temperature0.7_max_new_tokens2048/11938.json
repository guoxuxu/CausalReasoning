  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number frequency parameter. This function represents a complex exponential oscillation. Analyze the transformation with the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t))(\\\\xi) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i \\\\xi t} z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by applying a phase shift \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\), will the resulting Fourier transform be dependent solely on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying a phase shift \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) alters the original function to \\\\( e^{i (\\\\omega t + \\\\phi)} \\\\). Although the dominant frequency in the Fourier spectrum will still be \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), the phase shift introduces a complex multiplier \\\\( e^{i \\\\phi} \\\\) affecting the entire transformed function by shifting its phase, hence it depends on both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\).",
