  "Problem": "Consider a quadratic functional integral equation system governed by \\\\(I(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-x^2 + xt} dt\\\\). We examine the effects of applying the Fourier transform, defined as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(I)(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty I(x) e^{-ikx} dx\\\\).\n\nGiven the resultant function from the combined application of the Fourier and Laplace transforms, can we determine specifically whether the Fourier transform was applied before the Laplace transform?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the sequence of transformations solely from the resultant function is typically unfeasible without additional contextual information. The overlapping effects of the transformations in the integral and frequency domains complicate the identification of their sequential application.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
