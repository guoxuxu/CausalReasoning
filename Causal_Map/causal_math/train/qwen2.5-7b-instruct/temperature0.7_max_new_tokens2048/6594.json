  "Problem": "Imagine examining the relationship between the continuous applications of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) to a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) in the domain of complex functions and its inverse operations with operators involving complex conjugation. Suppose the complex function is defined as \\\\( f(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) and the operation under scrutiny is \\\\( g(f(t)) = \\\\overline{f(t)} \\\\), which takes the complex conjugate of \\\\( f(t) \\\\).\n\nCan the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) at t = 0 be exactly determined from the Laplace transform of \\\\( g(f(t)) \\\\) at t = T, assuming no knowledge of the use of \\\\( g \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complex conjugate manipulation and the transformative properties of the Laplace transform that depend on complex variables, losing the phase information due to \\\\( g \\\\) makes it impossible to uniquely retrieve \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without prior knowledge of the application of \\\\( g \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The original function f(t) influences its Laplace transform L[f(t)], and f(t) also influences the complex conjugate function g(f(t)), which in turn influences its Laplace transform L[g(f(t))]."
