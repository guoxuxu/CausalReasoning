  "Problem": "Consider a complex system where the current state is modified by a linear transformation followed by a nonlinear function. The linear transformation is represented by a matrix \\\\( M \\\\) and the nonlinear function is \\\\( h(z) = z^2 + c \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( z \\\\) represents the state vector in a complex function space.\n\nIf at a specific time a new linear transformation \\\\( N \\\\) is introduced as an intervention, will the system's state at a later time be dependent only on \\\\( M \\\\) and not on \\\\( N \\\\) or \\\\( h \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervening matrix \\\\( N \\\\) changes initial conditions previously set by \\\\( M \\\\) and modified by \\\\( h \\\\), leading to a new system trajectory. Hence, the system's future state depends critically on both \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) and the nonlinear function \\\\( h \\\\), showing dependency on multiple factors.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The current state is directly influenced by the linear transformation M and then modified by the nonlinear function h. Introducing a new linear transformation N as an intervention will directly change the state, making it dependent on both M and N, and indirectly through N on h."
