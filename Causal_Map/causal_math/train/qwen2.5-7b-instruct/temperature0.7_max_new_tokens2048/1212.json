  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed by a Fourier Transform, resulting in \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\). To further analyze or manipulate the signal, an operator \\\\( P(\\\\omega) \\\\) is applied in the frequency domain.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( x''(t) \\\\), the inverse Fourier Transform of \\\\( Q(\\\\omega)P(\\\\omega)X(\\\\omega) \\\\), can we determine what specific operations represented by \\\\( P(\\\\omega) \\\\) and \\\\( Q(\\\\omega) \\\\) were applied?",
  "Explanation": "The final signal \\\\( x''(t) \\\\) is an amalgamation of transformations by both \\\\( P(\\\\omega) \\\\) and \\\\( Q(\\\\omega) \\\\). These operations could overlap or mask each other’s effects, making it impossible to precisely discern what transformations were applied to \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) from the resultant \\\\( x''(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The original signal x(t) is transformed by the Fourier Transform to produce X(ω). The modified spectrum Q(ω)P(ω)X(ω) is then inverse transformed to yield the final signal x''(t)."
