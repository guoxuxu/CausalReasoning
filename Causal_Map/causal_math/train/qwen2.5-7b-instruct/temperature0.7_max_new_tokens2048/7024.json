  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Mx + Nu \\), where \\( M \\) and \\( N \\) are constant matrices, and \\( u(t) \\) is a control function. We explore the impact of a transformation \\( f(x) = Sx \\), where \\( S \\) is a linear invertible matrix applied instantaneously at a certain time.\n\nKnowing the value of \\( x(T) \\), can we conclusively determine which transformations were applied (whether \\( f(x) \\), \\( g(x) \\), or both) by having access only to the state \\( x(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying precise interventions purely from the endpoint \\( x(T) \\) is not feasible without additional context or data. Given the linearity and potential combinations of how \\( S \\) and \\( D \\) could affect \\( x \\), multiple combinations could lead to the same \\( x(T) \\). This ambiguity prevents unequivocal determination of past interventions based solely on observing \\( x(T) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The control input u(t) directly influences the state x over time. The transformation f(x) directly causes the state x(T) at time T. Similarly, the transformation g(x) directly causes the state x(T) at time T."
