  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz \\\\), where i is the imaginary unit. Assume an external transformation is defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{wt}z \\\\), where w is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) changes the initial condition of the system to \\\\( e^{wT}z_0 \\\\) before it follows the dynamics governed by the differential equation. Since the transformation \\\\( e^{wt} \\\\) modifies the initial state and the transformation is dependent on \\\\( t \\\\), the trajectory and final state at time T will differ.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial value z(0) directly influences z(t) through the differential equation dz/dt = iz. The constant w influences z(t) indirectly via the transformation f(z) = e^(wt)z, which then affects z(t). Without further intervention, z(t) at t = T under the given differential equation and transformation will be different from directly evolving z_0 to t = T under dz/dt = iz."
