  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Kz \\\\), where K is a complex constant. Analyze the impact of the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\), which transforms the function to \\\\( \\\\tilde{z}(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = \\\\frac{z(0)}{s-K} \\\\), and its inverse on the function's evolution over time.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and that an intervention changed \\\\( K \\\\) to \\\\( M \\\\), can we uniquely determine the time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) of the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple scenarios could lead to the same final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) due to the continuous and exponential nature of the function’s evolution. The specifics of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) do not isolate \\\\( t_1 \\\\) uniquely, as similar states can be achieved with different timing and duration of \\\\( K \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\).",
