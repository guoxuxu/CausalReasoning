  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) of a time-dependent signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\). Suppose the transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\frac{1}{s-a}Z(s) \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) after inverse transformation of \\\\( f(z) \\ applied on Z(s), can we certify the exact original Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) without evidence about the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without prior information about the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it is not possible to uniquely determine the original \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) since the transformation introduces a modification that can't be resolved solely based on the modified signal \\( x(t) \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The signal x(t) is transformed into Z(s) via the Laplace transform. Applying f(z) = 1/(s-a)Z(s) results in a modified version of Z(s), which when inverse-transformed, yields x(t)."
