  "Problem": "Consider a complex analysis context where the function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + cz \\\\), with \\\\( c \\\\) a complex constant, is analyzed in terms of its effect on the unit circle in the complex plane. We are particularly interested in how the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{it}z \\\\), for a real number \\\\( t \\\\), affects the evolution of points under \\\\( f(z) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) on the unit circle at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), and then it evolves without further modification under the definition of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), will the image of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) remain on the unit circle?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + cz \\\\) generally does not preserve the unit circle, particularly because the addition of the \\\\( cz \\\\) term (depending on the value of \\\\( c \\\\)) can map points inside or outside the unit circle.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The function f(z) transforms a point z0 on the unit circle, resulting in an image of z0 that remains on the unit circle if the initial conditions and properties of f(z) preserve the unit modulus."
