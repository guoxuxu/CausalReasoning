  "Problem": "Consider the eigenvalue problem in linear algebra, for a matrix \\\\( A \\\\) and a vector \\\\( v \\\\) such that \\\\( Av = \\\\lambda v \\\\). We explore the scenario where a transformation \\\\( g(v) = P^{-1}v \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( P \\\\) is an invertible matrix representing a change of basis.\n\nIf \\\\( g(v) \\\\) is applied to vector \\\\( v_0 \\\\) as a change of basis, and then we solve the eigenvalue problem for \\\\( A \\\\) without altering \\\\( A \\\\) or \\\\( P \\\\), will \\\\( v(t) \\\\) still be an eigenvector of \\\\( A \\\\) under this new basis?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(v) = P^{-1}v \\\\) merely represents a change of basis and does not alter the inherent properties of the matrix \\\\( A \\\\) or its eigenvectors. The transformed vector will still align with the eigenspace of \\\\( A \\\\), just expressed in a different basis.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the transformation g(v) = P^(-1)v changes the representation of vector v to v', which when multiplied by matrix A results in Av' = λ'v', indicating that under the new basis, v' is an eigenvector of A with eigenvalue λ'."
