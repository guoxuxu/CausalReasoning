  "Problem": "We consider an electrical system modeled by a complex function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), representing the impedance as a function of complex frequency \\\\( s \\\\). An intervention is applied by modifying the system impedance through an additional component described as \\\\( H(s) = e^{-st}Z(s) \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nGiven the final impedance observed, can we pinpoint precisely which interventions (either \\\\( H(s) \\\\), \\\\( K(s) \\\\), or both) have occurred, just by analyzing the outcome at \\\\( s = j\\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Analyzing just the final impedance result at \\\\( s = j\\\\omega \\\\) does not provide enough information to distinguish whether the original system passed through \\\\( H(s) \\\\), \\\\( K(s) \\\\), or both transformations. Exponential modifiers can result in similar effects, and without explicit knowledge of interventions, attributing effects to specific causes becomes indeterminable.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
