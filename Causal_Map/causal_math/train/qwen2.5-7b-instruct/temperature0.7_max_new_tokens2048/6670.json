  "Problem": "Consider the system of complex functions defined by \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + c \\\\) where \\\\( c \\\\) is a complex constant. This function is iterated over time t, generating a sequence in the complex plane that can exhibit dynamics typical of the Julia set. We explore the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sA}z ds \\\\), where A is a constant complex matrix, on this sequence.\n\nAfter observing a sequence at t = T, can we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), and given that this transformation could have significantly modified the initial conditions, reversing the operations to uniquely retrieve \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is not possible. The function's sensitivity to initial conditions in a complex dynamical system, such as those forming the Julia set, makes this recovery especially difficult.",
