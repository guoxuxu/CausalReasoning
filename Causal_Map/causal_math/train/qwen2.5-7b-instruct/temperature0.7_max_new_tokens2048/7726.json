  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} w \\\\), where A is a real constant and w is a constant complex vector. We are interested in evaluating the impact of the integral transformation \\\\( I(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{iB\\\\tau} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where B is another real constant.\n\nCan we uniquely recover the value of w from the function \\\\( z(T) \\\\) if we do not apply the transformation \\\\( I(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation \\\\( I(z) \\\\) was not applied, \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will simply be \\\\( e^{iAT} w \\\\). This allows recovery of w by applying the inverse \\\\( e^{-iAT} \\\\) to \\\\( z(T) \\\\) provided that the evolution was pure and no other transformations were applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
