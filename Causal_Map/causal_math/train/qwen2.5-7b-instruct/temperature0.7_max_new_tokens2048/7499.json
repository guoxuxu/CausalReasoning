  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time. The transformation being considered is given by \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nSuppose a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\theta t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a constant, is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention. Will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 exclusively rely on the dynamics \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -iz \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\theta t}z \\\\) adds another layer of complex exponential rotation, making the resultant state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on both the initial frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of the first transformation and the intervention frequency \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\), alongside the inherent dynamics of the system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "u(t) → z(t); v(t) → z(t); t_1 → g(z); θ → g(z); z(t) → z(T); t → dz/dt; ω → f(z); θ → f(z); t_1 → T",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state z(T) for T > t_1 is influenced by the transformation g(z) applied at t_1 and the dynamics dz/dt = -iz, but not by ω or θ."
