  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = t^2 + i \\\\cdot t \\\\) where \\\\( t \\\\) is a real number and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. Let's explore the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t z(s) \\\\, ds \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original function form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by knowing only the transformed output \\\\( T(z(T)) \\\\) without any modification?",
  "Explanation": "While the integral transformation provides some hints about the form of the function (e.g., particular terms in the integrand), it does not uniquely specify the function due to potential constants of integration and because the derivative of multiple functions can have the same integral form over an interval.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
