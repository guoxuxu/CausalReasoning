  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a differential operator. We investigate the role of a Fourier transform, defined by \\\\(F(u)(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx} u(x, t) dx\\\\), applied to the function u(x, t).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\(F\\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) and then allowed to evolve according to \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) without further intervention, will the transformed system's state \\\\(F(u)(k, t)\\\\) at time t = T be equivalent to simply transforming the state \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) directly?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform to the initial condition and allowing evolution under L will affect the system differently than directly transforming at a later time. The evolution of u under L and its interaction with different wavenumbers k, determined by the Fourier transform, will generally produce different outcomes when comparing these two processes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The Fourier transform of the initial condition u(x, 0) evolves over time according to the differential operator L, leading to F(u(k, t)), which is equivalent to transforming the state u(x, t) at any time t, including t = T."
