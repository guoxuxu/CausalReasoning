  "Problem": "Investigate a signal processing model driven by a linear time-invariant system with impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) governed by its Laplace Transform \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+a} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a positive constant. The impact of a Fourier transform modulation \\\\( m(t) = e^{i\\\\omega_0 t} \\\\) on the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is analyzed.\n\nCan the precise original input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and the specific intervention (modulation and/or filtering) be determined uniquely from the final output \\\\( y(T) \\\\) with certainty, knowing only the system response \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the aggregation of effects from the original input modulations, system response, and any interventions, multiple combinations of \\\\( x(t) \\\\), \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\), and \\\\( G(s) \\\\) could yield the same output \\\\( y(T) \\\\). The convolution and transformation processes do not allow for unambiguous backward calculation to determine specific inputs and interventions uniquely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The modulation m(t) directly influences the input signal x(t), and the system's transfer function H(s) directly determines the output y(T) through filtering."
