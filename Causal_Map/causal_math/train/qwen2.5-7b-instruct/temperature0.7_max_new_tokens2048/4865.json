  "Problem": "We examine the effect of applying a complex function transformation \\\\( z(w) = e^{i\\\\theta}w \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a constant. This transformation represents a rotation in the complex plane. Subsequently, the transformed complex number is used in a Fourier transform calculation \\\\( F(w) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-iwx} f(x) dx \\\\), where \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is some integrable function.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( z(w) \\\\) is applied to a complex parameter \\\\( w_0 \\\\) in the Fourier transform equation, will the outcome \\\\( F(z(w_0)) \\\\) at any later stage solely be a rotated version of \\\\( F(w_0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the rotated parameter \\\\( w_0 \\\\) will be a rotated version of \\\\( F(w_0) \\\\) due to the linear and shift-invariant properties of the Fourier transform under rotational transformations in the complex plane.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
