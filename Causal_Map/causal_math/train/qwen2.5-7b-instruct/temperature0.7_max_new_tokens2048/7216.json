  "Problem": "Analyze a mechanical system in a complex plane under the influence of an external force and initial conditions. The position of a particle in the complex plane is described by the equation \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) represent the real and imaginary components of the position, respectively, in time t. The position is further affected by the transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the position \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at a final time T, can we determine precisely which transformations were applied to the system (either \\\\(h(z)\\\\), \\\\(k(z)\\\\), or both) based only on the knowledge of \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identical positions in the complex plane at time T can be achieved under different combinations of transformations \\\\(h(z)\\\\) and \\\\(k(z)\\\\), given that both function in similar rotational manners but with potentially offsetting angular rotations. It is impossible to uniquely determine the interventions from the final position alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The real component u(t) and the imaginary component v(t) together determine the position z(t) in the complex plane. The transformation h(z) applied to z(t) results in z(T) at time T."
