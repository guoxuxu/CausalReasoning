  "Problem": "Analyze causal behavior in a system undergoing Laplace transformation defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\). Scenario dives into whether the performance and predictions of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems governed by convolution integrals \\\\( (f * g)(t) = \\\\int_0^t f(\\\\tau) g(t - \\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) can be inferred or influenced by certain transformation functions.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform of the output \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(y)(s) \\\\) at a particular time post-intervention, can the exact nature of the intervention (the function \\\\( h(t) \\\\)) be determined unambiguously?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation provides the final sum effect in the Laplace domain, but without specific details on how contributions individually govern the result. Multiple configurations of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) could yield the same transformed output due to integral and transformation properties, thereby not allowing an unambiguous determination of the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "h(t) → mathcal{L}(y)(s); mathcal{L}(f)(s) → mathcal{L}(y)(s); (f * g)(t) → y(t)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The intervention function h(t) directly influences the Laplace transform of the output mathcal{L}(y)(s), which is also causally related to the Laplace transform of the system function mathcal{L}(f)(s) and the convolution integral (f * g)(t) that determines the system's response y(t)."
