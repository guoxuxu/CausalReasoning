  "Problem": "Consider a 2D linear system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a constant matrix. Let us introduce a transformation defined by the operator \\\\(L[\\\\phi(x)] = \\\\int_0^t e^{Bs} \\\\phi(x(s)) ds\\\\), where \\\\(B\\\\) is also a constant matrix. We study the system's behavior over time with this transformation.\n\nSuppose at a time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), an intervention via a transformation \\\\(M[\\\\psi(x)] = x(t_1) + \\\\int_{t_1}^T e^{C(s-t1)} \\\\psi(x(s)) ds\\\\) is applied, where \\\\(C\\\\) is a constant matrix. Considering this, will the state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\) only depend on matrix \\\\(A\\\\) and not on \\\\(B\\\\) or \\\\(C\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention will impact the trajectory by incorporating a new transformation \\\\(M\\\\). Therefore, the final state at time \\\\(T\\\\) will depend on the interplay of matrices \\\\(A\\\\), \\\\(B\\\\), and \\\\(C\\\\) due to their contributions through each applying transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The state x(T) at time T is influenced by the initial system dynamics matrix A through the transformation L[φ(x)], and is also affected by the intervention matrix C through the transformation M[ψ(x)], but does not directly depend on matrix B."
