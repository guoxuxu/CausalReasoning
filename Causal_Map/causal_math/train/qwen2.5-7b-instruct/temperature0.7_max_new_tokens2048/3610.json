  "Problem": "The behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by a complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a frequency parameter, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant complex number. An operation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) is considered where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex scaling factor.\n\nAfter observing the state of the system \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at a later time T, can we uniquely determine the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the operation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The lack of information about the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at the initial time leaves ambiguity in determining \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The same final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from various initial conditions depending on whether or not the scaling operation was applied, especially considering complex exponential growth or decay.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The frequency parameter ω and constant k determine the rate of change of z with respect to time. The complex scaling factor α and time t determine the operation h(z). The initial condition z0 determines z(t) and its rate of change. Applying the operation h(z) transforms z(t) to z(T)."
