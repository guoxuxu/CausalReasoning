  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by a Laplace Transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\\\) and its original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\). We are scrutinizing the influence of a linear operator \\\\( T \\\\) operating on \\\\( f(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( T[f(t)] = t \\\\cdot f(t) \\\\).\n\nAfter obtaining the result \\\\( L[U[T[f(t)]]] \\\\) at a certain value of \\\\( s \\\\), can we precisely deduce the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and the exact sequence of operations (\\\\( T \\\\) followed by \\\\( U \\\\), or vice versa) used?",
  "Explanation": "The same final transformed result could be achieved through differing sequences or types of operations due to the properties and overlap of operations in the transformation space. The specific nature of Laplace Transforms and the interplay between multiplication by \\\\( t \\\\) and exponential modification does not allow for a unique backward determination of sequence from the final transformed function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the linear operator T to f(t) results in T[f(t)], which is then processed by U to produce U[T[f(t)]]. The Laplace transform of T[f(t)] leads to L[U[T[f(t)]]], but this does not allow for precise deduction of f(t) or the exact sequence of operations without additional information."
