  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a constant matrix, and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. The system is analyzed under the transformation defined by the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) applied to a function \\\\( h(t) = e^{-At^2} \\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and the system is thereafter left without any further operations, will the resulting function be equivalent to directly applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to \\\\( t^2 \\\\) under the transformation by matrix A?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to \\\\( h(t) = e^{-At^2} \\\\) significantly alters the characteristics of the function, especially since the matrix A affects the squaring of t in a non-trivial way that changes the base function's nature before transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Fourier Transform to h(t) does not result in the Fourier Transform of t^2."
