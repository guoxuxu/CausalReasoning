  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) representing an electric voltage across a resistor in a circuit, governed by a linear differential operator \\\\( L \\\\). The influence of the Laplace transform, denoted by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\), is examined to understand the circuit's behavior over time.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is intervened at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by applying another operator, say \\\\( M \\\\), which also modifies frequency components, will the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T rely only on the operator \\\\( L \\\\) and not on the Laplace transform or \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with operator \\\\( M \\\\) introduces additional modifications that, combined with changes made by the initial Laplace transform, make the function's behavior at t = T dependent on all applied transformations (Laplace, \\\\( L \\\\), and \\\\( M \\\\)), leading to a composition of effects that influence the final outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The behavior of z(t) at t = T is directly influenced by the operator L and indirectly influenced by the intervention M, which modifies z(t). The Laplace transform does not directly affect z(T) but can provide insights into the system's behavior under different operators."
