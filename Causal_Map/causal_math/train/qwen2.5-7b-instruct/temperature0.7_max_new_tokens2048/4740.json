  "Problem": "We consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) where A is a constant matrix. The system is subjected to an integral transform defined by \\\\( g(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{B\\\\tau}x(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where B is also a constant matrix.\n\nCan the specific intervention (whether \\\\( g(x) \\\\), \\\\( h(x) \\\\), or both) be precisely identified merely by observing the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) and knowing A?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) could result from different sequences or types of interventions due to the additive and overlapping effects of the matrix exponentials in B and C on the system dynamics, making it unfeasible to unambiguously determine the interventions from the final state alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
