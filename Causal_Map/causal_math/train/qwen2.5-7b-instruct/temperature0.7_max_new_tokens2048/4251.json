  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions evolving over time according to the system \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = Pz(t)\\\\), with P being a constant matrix. We investigate the effect of a linear transformation \\\\( g(z) = Qz \\\\), where Q is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf a new transformation \\\\( h(z) = Rz \\\\) (where R is another constant matrix) is introduced as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on P, not considering the effects of Q or R?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( h(z) = Rz \\\\) as an intervention introduces additional dynamics to the evolution of the system. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be influenced by the transformations \\\\( Q \\\\) and \\\\( R \\\\) in addition to the matrix P. The interplay of these matrices can change the trajectory significantly.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
