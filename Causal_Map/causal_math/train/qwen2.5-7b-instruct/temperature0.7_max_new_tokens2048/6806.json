  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\omega z + Kz \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) a real constant representing angular frequency and K a complex constant. We explore the effects of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{st}z(s)\\\\, ds \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( T(z) \\\\), the original state \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined. The transformation might have altered the function in ways that are not reversible, especially since the parameters \\\\( s \\\\) could introduce significant modifications.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of z(t) is influenced by -iωz(t) and Kz(t); T(z) transforms z(t) over time through integration; s affects the transformation T(z); z(0) determines the initial state of z(t)"
