  "Problem": "Consider the space of complex functions \\\\(z(t)\\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant. Suppose we apply an integral transformation represented by \\\\(\\\\hat{z}(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt\\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nCan we infer the initial function \\\\(z_0(t)\\\\) after observing \\\\(\\\\hat{z}(s)\\\\) at any time \\\\(T\\\\) without knowing whether the transformation was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Given the linear and time-invariant nature of both the differential operator \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z\\\\) and the transformation \\\\(\\\\hat{z}(s)\\\\), the initial function \\\\(z_0(t)\\\\) can be uniquely determined from \\\\(\\\\hat{z}(s)\\\\) under the assumption that the inverse Laplace transform is well-defined and \\\\(s\\\\) includes the necessary frequency components to recover \\\\(z_0(t)\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
