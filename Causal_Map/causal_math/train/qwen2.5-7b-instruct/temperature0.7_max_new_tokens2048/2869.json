  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 \\phi = 0 \\\\) in two dimensions, where \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) is a scalar potential. The complex function transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{wz} \\\\) is applied to the complex variable \\\\( z = x + iy \\\\), with \\\\( w \\\\) being a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied transforming the boundary condition of \\\\( z \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 \\phi = 0 \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) at a point \\\\( z \\\\) in the domain be the same as if the boundary was untransformed?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) alters the boundary conditions for \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\), which fundamentally changes the potential function within the domain due to the unique solutions dictated by Laplace’s equation under different boundary conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "f(z) → transformed boundary; transformed boundary → φ at z; untransformed boundary → φ at z",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation f(z) changes the boundary condition, which in turn affects the value of φ at point z; without the transformation, the boundary remains unchanged, leading to a different value of φ at point z."
