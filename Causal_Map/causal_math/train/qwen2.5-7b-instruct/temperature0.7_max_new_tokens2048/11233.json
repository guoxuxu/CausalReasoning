  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency, and we study its behavior under the integral transformation \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-i\\\\omega s} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) and then allowed to evolve without further intervention, will the transformed function maintain the same periodicity as the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation changes the frequency components of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), effectively adding a phase shift and altering the frequency content due to the convolution with a decaying exponential. This causes a change in the periodicity of the original function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
