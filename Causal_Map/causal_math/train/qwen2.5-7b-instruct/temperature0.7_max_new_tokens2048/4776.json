  "Problem": "Consider a function \\(h(z) = \\frac{1}{z}\\) in the complex plane and its transformation under the integral \\( I[h] = \\int_{\\gamma} h(z) \\, dz \\) along a contour \\( \\gamma \\). The contour \\( \\gamma \\) is relevant as it defines the effect of \\( h \\) after transformation via path integral.\n\nBased on the integral result \\( I[h'] \\) after applying \\( g(z) \\), can it be conclusively determined whether \\( g(z) \\) was added to \\( h(z) \\) if \\( I[h'] \\) is nonzero?",
  "Explanation": "The nonzero value of \\(I[h']\\) can result merely from the integral of \\(h(z)\\) if \\( \\gamma \\) encloses the pole of \\(h(z)\\). Without additional information about \\( g(z) \\) and its effects within \\( \\gamma \\), we cannot definitively claim that \\( g(z) \\) influenced the outcome besides \\( h(z) \\).",
