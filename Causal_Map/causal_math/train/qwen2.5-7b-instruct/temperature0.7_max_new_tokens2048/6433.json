  "Problem": "Consider a complex variable function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant coefficients. We explore the effect of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) on this system over time t, where C is a complex constant.\n\nWould the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) to the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and evolving it under the equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) without any further changes result in the same endpoint as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was evolved directly?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) alters the initial state, and thus modifies how the state evolves. Given that C influences the growth or decay of the real and imaginary components differently than A and B alone, the final state will differ.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
