  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the temperature change over time is modeled by the differential equation \\\\(dT/dt = kT\\\\), where k is a temperature-dependent conductivity coefficient. We investigate the effect of a transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(T) = T^2 \\\\) applied at different times.\n\nIf \\\\( f(T) \\\\) which squares the temperature T is applied at time t = 0, and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\(dT/dt = kT\\\\) without further intervention, will the temperature \\\\( T(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( T_0 \\\\), the initial temperature, was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(dT/dt = kT\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the function \\\\( f(T) = T^2 \\\\) at the initial stage changes the starting temperature to \\\\( T_0^2 \\\\). Since the rate of change of temperature is proportional to the temperature itself, the squared initial condition accelerates the temperature increase, diverging significantly from the trajectory when started at \\\\( T_0 \\\\) under \\\\(dT/dt = kT\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial temperature T_0 directly causes T through evolution according to the differential equation dT/dt = kT. Applying the transformation f(T) = T^2 at t=0 changes T to T^2 but does not affect the subsequent evolution of T according to dT/dt = kT. Therefore, the temperature T at t=T after applying f(T) and allowing the system to evolve is not the same as if T_0 had been directly evolved to t=T without the transformation."
