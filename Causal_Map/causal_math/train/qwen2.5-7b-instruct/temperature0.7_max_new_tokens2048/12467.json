  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution in a rod over time is modeled by the heat equation \\\\(u_t = k u_{xx}\\\\), where \\\\(u_t\\\\) is the time derivative of temperature, \\\\(u_{xx}\\\\) is the second spatial derivative, and \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We explore the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) to the initial temperature distribution, particularly how this transform impacts the system dynamics.\n\nGiven the temperature profile \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) at time T, can we precisely determine what interventions (application of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) or \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\\\)) were used only by knowing the temperature at \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final temperature profile \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) might result from various combinations of applying and/or reversing the Fourier transform, along with the natural evolution under the heat equation. The multiple possibilities and similarity in outcomes from different sequences of transforms make it impossible to uniquely identify which interventions were executed.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
