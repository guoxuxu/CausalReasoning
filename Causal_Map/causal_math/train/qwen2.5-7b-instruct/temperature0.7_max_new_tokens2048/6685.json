  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. We study the effect of differentiating this function and the subsequent application of a Fourier transform.\n\nDoes the differentiation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any intervention change the Fourier transform compared to the Fourier transform of the original function?",
  "Explanation": "Differentiating \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) results in \\\\( i \\\\omega e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), which fundamentally changes the frequency components in the Fourier transform. The transformation results in a translation of the frequency spectrum, inducing a different outcome in the Fourier transform spectrum (specifically, a multiplication by \\\\( i \\\\omega \\\\) in the frequency domain).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
