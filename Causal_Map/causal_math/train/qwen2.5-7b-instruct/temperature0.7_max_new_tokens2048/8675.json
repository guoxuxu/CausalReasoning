  "Problem": "Analyze the effect of a variable transformation using a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) on the integration path in the complex plane. Given a continuous function g(z), we examine the integral transformation from the function \\\\( \\\\int g(z)\\\\, dz \\\\) over a specific path P to \\\\( \\\\int g(f(z))f'(z)\\\\, dz \\\\) over the same path.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied during the integrals calculation changing the path to Q, does this ensure that the endpoint results of \\\\( \\\\int g(f(h(z)))h'(z)f'(h(z))\\\\, dz \\\\) will depend only on the functions g and f?",
  "Explanation": "The added transformation with \\\\( h(z) \\\\), which affects both the integrand and the path, introduces another layer of complexity. The final integral is now dependent on additional modifications brought by the new path and the squared transformation, profoundly impacting the end results alongside the original g and f functions.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
