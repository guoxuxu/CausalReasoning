  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z(t) = C e^{Dt}\\\\), where the matrix \\\\(D\\\\) governs the dynamics of \\\\(z\\\\), and \\\\(C\\\\) is a vector of initial conditions. The system undergoes a transformation via another function \\\\(h(z) = Mz\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\), where \\\\(M\\\\) is a transformation matrix.\n\nGiven observation of the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\), is it possible to infer whether the transformation \\\\(h(z)\\\\) was applied at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\) without knowledge of \\\\(M\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given only the transformed endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) and no information about the matrix \\\\(M\\\\), it is not possible to infer conclusively whether the initial state was transformed. Various combinations of \\\\(M\\\\) and \\\\(C\\\\) could lead to the same observed state, making the transformation indeterminable without additional information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The matrix D governs the dynamics of z, C sets the initial conditions of z, M transforms z through h at t=0, and the state z at time T depends on both the dynamics governed by D and the initial conditions C. Applying the transformation h(z) at t=0 changes the state of z according to M."
