  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. The function describes the evolution of a complex number over time. An integral transformation \\\\( T{[z]} = \\\\int_0^T z(t) dt \\\\) is applied to study the cumulative effect over the interval from 0 to T.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves naturally without any intervention, will the transformation \\\\( T{[z]} \\\\) result in the same outcome if the initial frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) was different?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome of \\\\( T{[z]} \\\\) is highly dependent on the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Changes in \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) alter the oscillation speed of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), and thus the resulting integral \\\\( T{[z]} \\\\). Different frequencies lead to different outcomes in the integral computation.",
