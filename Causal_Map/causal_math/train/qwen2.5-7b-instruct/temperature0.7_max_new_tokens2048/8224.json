  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation defined by \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\} = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\) where \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) is the Laplace Transform. Let \\( f(t) \\) be a function such that \\( f(t) = t^2 \\). We intervene by adding a constant \\( k \\) to \\( f(t) \\), modifying it to \\( f_k(t) = t^2 + k \\) before applying \\( \\mathcal{L} \\).\n\nGiven the output of \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{ f_k(t) \\} \\), is it possible to determine exactly what value \\( k \\) was used, assuming \\( f(t) = t^2 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "If the resultant transform is known, one can subtract \\( \\frac{2}{s^3} \\) from the output to find \\( \\frac{k}{s} \\). Solving for \\( k \\) in this expression will give us the exact value of the intervention \\( k \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
