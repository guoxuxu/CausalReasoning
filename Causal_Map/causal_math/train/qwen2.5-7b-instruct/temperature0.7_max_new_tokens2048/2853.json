  "Problem": "Consider a complex contour integral in the complex plane. We will evaluate the integral \\\\( I = \\\\int_{C} e^{zt}dz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a closed path and \\\\( t \\\\) is a real number parameter. The analysis is affected by transformations using the function \\\\( f(z) = z^{2} + a \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied on all points along contour \\\\( C \\\\) at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), and then the integral \\\\( I \\\\) is evaluated without further alterations, will the result of the integral \\\\( I \\\\) be the same as without applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the contour \\\\( C \\\\) using \\\\( f(z) \\\\) results in a new contour with potentially different properties (such as moving poles or altering residues). This alteration will likely change the result of the integral \\\\( I \\\\), since the integral's value can be sensitive to these transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation f(z) → I changes the integral's value, while the contour C and the parameter t → I do not directly cause a change in I without the transformation."
