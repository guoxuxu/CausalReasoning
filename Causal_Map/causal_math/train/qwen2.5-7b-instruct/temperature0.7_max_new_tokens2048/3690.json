  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant. We analyze the behavior of this function under the Fourier transform, defined as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(z)(\\\\xi) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i \\\\xi t} dt\\\\).\n\nCan we recover the original function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) by knowing its Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(z)(\\\\xi)\\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Given the Fourier transform that results in a delta function at \\\\(\\\\xi = \\\\omega\\\\), we can uniquely recover \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) as it is the only function that corresponds to such a specific result in the Fourier domain. The transform provides complete information to reconstruct the original function.",
