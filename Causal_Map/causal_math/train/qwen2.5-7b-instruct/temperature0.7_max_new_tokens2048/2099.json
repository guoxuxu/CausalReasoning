  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined on the complex plane, where \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\) with \\\\( A \\\\) being a complex number and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) the initial complex value. We explore how a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another complex number, influences \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time.\n\nAssuming the function \\\\( k(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) (where \\\\( C \\\\) is another complex constant) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T > t_1 depend exclusively on the matrix \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( B \\\\) or \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces another altering element, making the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on all three constants: \\\\( A, B, \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\). The transformations led by \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) influence the trajectory and the endpoint through cumulative effects and potential interference phenomena.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The final state z(T) depends on A through the transformation e^(At)z_0, and is influenced by B and C through the transformations e^(Bt) and e^(Ct) respectively, but the direct dependency of z(T) on A remains primary."
