  "Problem": "Analyze the relationship between the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and its effect on a differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + y = f(t) \\\\). Assume all functions involved are sufficiently smooth and decay at infinity for the Fourier transform to exist.\n\nIf a damping term \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\) (where \\\\( a \\\\) is a positive constant) is introduced as an intervention to the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) during the progression, does this change the final form of \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) in the equation \\\\( s^2Y(s) - sy(0) - y'(0) + Y(s) = F(s) \\\\) after adapting for \\\\( F(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing the damping term modifies \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to \\\\( f(t)e^{-at} \\\\). This affects the Fourier transform of \\\\( f \\\\), changing it to \\\\( F(s+a) \\\\). Therefore, the differential equation in terms of \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) and the new \\\\( F(s+a) \\\\) would not be the same as before, altering the relationship and the solution for \\\\( Y(s) \\\\).",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Fourier transform F(s) of f(t) influences Y(s), and introducing the damping term e^{-at} results in a modified F(s) (now G(s)) which in turn affects Y(s). The operator s^2, along with initial conditions -sy(0) and -y'(0), also directly influences Y(s)."
