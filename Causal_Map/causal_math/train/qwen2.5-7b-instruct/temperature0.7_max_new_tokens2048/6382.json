  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. The function describes a rotation in the complex plane over time t. We analyze the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the exact form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for all t in [0, T] after observing the output of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at t = T, without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) provides a cumulative, integral result of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) up to time T, which obscures individual function states at intermediate times. Knowing the integral value alone does not allow reversal to the exact sequence of function states from t = 0 to T due to the loss of temporal information in integration.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
