  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a continuous time Fourier transform on a function \\\\( g(t) = e^{-at^2} \\\\), where \\\\( a > 0 \\\\) is a constant, and its interaction with the Laplace transform of the same function. Let \\\\( F(s) \\\\) be the Laplace transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\), and let \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\) be the Fourier transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the forms of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\), can we conclusively determine the original function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) uniquely without knowing whether it was subjected to a Fourier transform or a Laplace transform?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the type of transformation (Fourier or Laplace) applied, and considering that many different functions can yield similar transformed results in different domains, it is not feasible to uniquely backtrack to the original function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) without ambiguity.",
