  "Problem": "Consider a functional space where functions are transformed by an integral operator \\\\( T[f](x) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-xt} f(t) dt \\\\), which represents the Laplace transform. The initial function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and its transform are studied over different conditions and manipulations of variable x.\n\nIf an initial function \\\\( f(t) = e^{-at} \\\\) where a is a constant, is transformed by T, and then allowed to evolve over variable x without further intervention, will the transformed function at a different x value yield the same Laplace transformed result?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed function depends on the parameter x explicitly, so varying x will lead to a different result of the integral transform even if the original function remains unchanged. Therefore, the result of the Laplace transform is sensitive to changes in x.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial function f(t) is transformed by the Laplace transform operator T into T[f](x), and this transformation result depends on x; thus, changing x will yield a different T[f](x) unless f(t) is specifically chosen such that it remains invariant under the Laplace transform with respect to x."
