  "Problem": "Consider the integration transformation \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-zt} f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a given function and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. This transformation maps a function from the time domain to the Laplace transform in the complex domain.\n\nBased on knowledge of \\\\( J(z) \\\\) alone, can we determine if the transformation resulted from an original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) or its modified form \\\\( j(t) = f(t) + k(t) \\\\) following an intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing only \\\\( J(z) \\\\) does not provide sufficient information to ascertain whether \\\\( J(z) \\\\) came from an unmodified \\\\( f(t) \\\\), or from the intervention-modified \\\\( j(t) \\\\). Without additional information about the nature and timing of the interventions, multiple candidates for the original function remain plausible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
