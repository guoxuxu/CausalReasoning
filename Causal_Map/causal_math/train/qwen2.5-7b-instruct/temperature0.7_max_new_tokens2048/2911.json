  "Problem": "We examine the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under the integral transform \\\\( T(z)(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(t-s)A}z(s) ds \\\\), where A is a constant complex matrix. This scenario explores both the direct evolution of the function and the impact of modifications through an operational function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where B is another constant matrix.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention via a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) (where C is another constant matrix) is applied, will the resulting \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on the matrix A and not on B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) injects another complex exponential condition through \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\), further influencing the behavior of the function under the integral transform. The final outcome \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) reflects compounded influences from A, B, and C, affecting both the course and the characteristic of the integrand across different segments.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
