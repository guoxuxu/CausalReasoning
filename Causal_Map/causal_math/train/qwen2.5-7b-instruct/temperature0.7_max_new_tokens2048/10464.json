  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex function scenario where the function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolves over time, under the influence of a transformation represented by \\\\( T(z) = e^{At}z \\\\), where A is a complex constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine what transformations were applied (whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( S(z) \\\\), or both), solely by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could have resulted from various combinations of the transformations and their timing. The interactions between the exponential effects of A and B create a multitude of possible evolutions leading to the same final point, making it complex to definitively ascertain which transformations were applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
