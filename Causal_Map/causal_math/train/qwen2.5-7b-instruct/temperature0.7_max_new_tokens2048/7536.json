  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z \\) defined in the complex plane as \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant frequency. We study the effect of adding a linear transformation represented by \\( T(z) = az + b \\) (where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are complex constants) on the behavior of \\( z(t) \\).\n\nGiven the state \\( z(T) \\), can we determine precisely what transformations were used (whether \\( T(z) \\), \\( U(z) \\), or both), solely based on the value of \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The complex function and its transformations can yield similar outcomes from different parameters \\( a \\), \\( b \\), \\( c \\), and \\( d \\) due to the inherent properties of complex additions and multiplications. This indeterminacy makes it impossible to uniquely identify the transformations applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z(T) is influenced by both the linear transformation T(z) and possibly another transformation U(z), given that z(t) evolves through time according to the initial function."
