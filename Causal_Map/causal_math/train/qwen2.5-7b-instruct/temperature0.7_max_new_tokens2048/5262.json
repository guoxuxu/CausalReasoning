  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = u(x) + iv(y) \\\\) representing a complex function where \\\\( u(x) \\\\) and \\\\( v(y) \\\\) are real functions defined in terms of x and y, respectively. Examine the influence of the linear transformation \\\\( L(z) = Az + B \\\\) where A and B are complex constants on the evolution of the function over the complex domain.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( L(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about the application of \\\\( L(z) \\\\), we cannot distinguish whether the observed transformations in \\\\( z(t) \\\\) occurred purely due to the function \\\\( z = u(x) + iv(y) \\\\) or were influenced by the initial application of \\\\( L(z) \\\\). The modification introduced by A and B complicates tracing back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) uniquely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the linear transformation L(z) influences the evolution of z(t), and knowing z(t) at time t=T does not necessarily allow deducing the original complex number z_0 without additional information."
