  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) where z is a complex variable. We evaluate the function under the transformation defined by the integral \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^z f(u) du \\\\).\n\nIf the integral transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is calculated for a particular z, and we let z evolve in the complex plane without intervention, will the change in \\\\( g(z) \\\\) solely correspond to the integral of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) along that path?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) as an integral of \\\\( f(u) = e^{iu} \\\\) from 0 to z will depend only on the path of integration. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus ensures that, for any path of z in the complex plane, the change in \\\\( g(z) \\\\) corresponds exactly to the integral of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) along that specific path.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
