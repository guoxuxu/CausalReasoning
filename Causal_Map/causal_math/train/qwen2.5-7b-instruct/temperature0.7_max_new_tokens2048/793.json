  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\). We examine the effect of a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) applied to the variable z in the complex plane over time t, where i is the imaginary unit.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied without further intervention, will \\\\( f(g(z_0)) \\\\) at t = T be the same as applying \\\\( f \\\\) directly to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) for any z in the complex plane?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the initial value to \\\\( e^{iz_0} \\\\). So, \\\\( f(g(z_0)) = (e^{iz_0})^2 = e^{i2z_0} \\\\), which differs generally from \\\\( f(z_0) = z_0^2 \\\\) due to the exponential and trigonometric nature of the transformation, affecting the magnitude and phase.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of g(z) to z_0 results in g(z_0), which is then transformed by f to produce f(g(z_0)). Since f(z) = z^2, applying f to g(z_0) means (e^(iz))^2 = e^(2iz), and this transformation is independent of the initial z_0 value, making f(g(z_0)) distinct from f(z_0) unless z_0 is specifically chosen such that e^(2iz) = z^2."
