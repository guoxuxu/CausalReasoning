  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a linear time-invariant system having an impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\). The system output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is determined by the convolution of the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and the impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\), given by \\\\( y(t) = (x * h)(t) \\\\). An operator \\\\( G \\\\) defined by \\\\( Gx(t) = x(t - \\tau) \\\\) acts as a delay of \\\\( \\tau \\\\) seconds on the input.\n\nGiven the final output, can we determine if the input was first delayed and then amplified, or first amplified then delayed, by only knowing the structure of the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific information about the original signal or the order of operations, it's impossible to distinguish based on the output alone whether the input was first delayed then amplified, or first amplified then delayed. The final output expression in either case would be identical due to the commutative property of linear operations in this context.",
