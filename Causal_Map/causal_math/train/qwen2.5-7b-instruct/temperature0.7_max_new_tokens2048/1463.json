  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Mx\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. The effect of an external input characterized by the matrix function \\\\( u(t) = e^{Nt}x \\\\) is analyzed, where N is another constant matrix.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) an intervention function \\\\( v(x) = e^{Qt}x \\\\) (where Q is a constant matrix) is applied, will the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 purely be dependent on the original matrix M, ignoring effects from N and Q?",
  "Explanation": "Since the intervention with \\\\( v(x) \\\\) modifies the state once more, the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) depends on the interplay among M, N, and Q. Each matrix potentially skews the state's trajectory in uniquely contributing manners, rendering the final state a result of compounded transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
