  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where we analyze the flow of a fluid in a channel influenced by a vector field \\\\( \\\\vec{v} = k(x,y,z) \\\\vec{u} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a scalar function of position and \\\\( \\\\vec{u} \\\\) is the original velocity field. The fluid properties are altered by a transformation, described by \\\\( g(\\\\vec{v}) = \\\\vec{v} + \\\\nabla h \\\\), where \\\\( h(x,y,z,t) \\\\) is a scalar field function of space and time.\n\nAfter observing the fluid dynamics at time T, can we determine precisely whether the initial transformation, the corrective transformation, both, or neither were applied?",
  "Explanation": "The fluid dynamic at T can result from various combinations of transformations due to the complexities in the flow's sensitivity to initial conditions and subsequent interventions. Identifying the precise sequence or types of transformations exclusively from the final state can be ambiguous and challenging.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "k(x,y,z) → v; v → g(v); h(x,y,z,t) → ∇h; ∇h → g(v); v → fluid dynamics; g(v) → fluid dynamics",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The scalar function k influences the velocity field v, which in turn affects the transformed velocity field g(v). The scalar field h influences the gradient ∇h, which then modifies g(v). Both the initial velocity field v and the transformed velocity field g(v) influence the fluid dynamics."
