  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We analyze the impact of the linear operator \\\\( L \\{z\\} = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z(t)dt \\\\), known as the Laplace transform, on this function over time.\n\nGiven the transformed function after intervention, \\\\( L\\{e^{-at}z(t)\\}(s) \\\\), can the presence of the damping factor \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\) and its parameter \\\\( a \\\\) be uniquely determined together with \\\\( \\omega \\\\), only by knowing the transformed result?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform post-intervention, \\\\( L\\{e^{-at}z(t)\\}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s + a - i\\omega} \\\\), exhibits a pole at \\\\( s = -(a - i\\omega) \\\\). Both the damping factor parameter \\\\( a \\\\) and the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) can be uniquely extracted from the real and imaginary parts of this expression, respectively.",
