  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{gz} \\\\) where g is a complex constant. This function is used to transform the path of integration in the complex plane for the integral \\\\( I = \\\\int_C e^{z^2} dz \\\\), where C is initially the real axis from -∞ to +∞.\n\nGiven the final computed value of \\\\( I \\\\), can we precisely trace back and identify the sequence and specifics of transformations (whether by \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) used during the integration process?",
  "Explanation": "Owing to the complexity and variable paths through different domains in the complex plane, multiple transformation sequences could lead to similar integral values. The transformations due to \\\\( e^{gz} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{mz} \\\\) may interchangeable or offer overlapping effects, complicating the precise tracing of transformation sequences solely by evaluating the end result of the integral.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
