  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit governed by the differential equation \\( \\frac{d^2 q}{dt^2} + R\\frac{dq}{dt} + \\frac{1}{L}q = 0 \\), where \\( q(t) \\) is the charge, \\( R \\) is the resistance, and \\( L \\) is the inductance. Let's analyze the effect of introducing a sinusoidal voltage source \\( V(t) = V_0 \\sin(\\omega t) \\) and its impact on the steady-state solution of the system.\n\nGiven the final observed charge \\( q(T) \\), can we conclusively determine whether the additional damping factor \\( \\lambda \\) was introduced or if the characteristics of the voltage source \\( V(t) \\) were altered instead?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complexity of the system and the interaction between the circuit properties and the external forcing functions, multiple configurations of \\( \\lambda \\) and alterations to \\( V(t) \\) could lead to the same observed charge \\( q(T) \\). Without further information, it is impossible to determine with certainty the exact nature of the interventions or changes applied to the system.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
