  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace Transform of a function \\( f(t) \\) given by \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{ f(t) \\} = F(s) \\). For causal inference, analyze the impacts of altering \\( F(s) \\) to \\( F(s) + \\frac{1}{s-a} \\) without and with interventions.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\( F(s) \\) to \\( F(s) + n \\frac{1}{s-a} \\) at a specific moment, will the consequent function \\( f(t) \\) simply scale the exponential term \\( e^{at} \\) without altering the behavior of other components of \\( f(t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention that multiplies the \\( \\frac{1}{s-a} \\) term by \\( n \\) will simply scale the corresponding term \\( e^{at} \\) by \\( n \\) in the time domain without altering other components of \\( f(t) \\). The Laplace Transform's linearity ensures that other terms remain unaffected.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
