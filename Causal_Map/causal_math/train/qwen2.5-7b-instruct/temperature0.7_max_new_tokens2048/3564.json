  "Problem": "Consider a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\nabla^2 u \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) represents temperature distribution in a material and \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. To test the effect of a spatial transformation, let's apply a rotation matrix \\\\( R(\\\\theta) \\\\) to the spatial coordinates.\n\nGiven the distribution \\\\( u(x, y, t) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we precisely resolve all actions (including any spatial transformations) applied to the system, from its initial state to time \\\\( T \\\\), by knowing only the final distribution?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the thermal diffusion properties being largely smoothing and potentially isotropic, it's particularly challenging to back-calculate any applied spatial transformations from the temperature distribution alone at time \\\\( T \\\\). The transformations could have overlapping effects, enhancing the complexity of unambiguous determination.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The temperature distribution u at time T transforms under rotation R to become u', thermal diffusivity k governs the change in temperature over time through the equation ∂u/∂t = k ∇²u."
