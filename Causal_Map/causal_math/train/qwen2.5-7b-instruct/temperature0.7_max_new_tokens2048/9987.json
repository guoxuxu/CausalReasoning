  "Problem": "Consider a complex plane where functions are transformed by Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = F(s) \\\\). We explore how integrating these transformations affects the plane's structures, examining the impact of tweaking the function by a constant linear shift \\\\( g(t) = f(t) + c \\\\) where c is a real number.\n\nIf an intervention modifies the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to \\\\( h(t) = K*f(t) + d \\\\) (where \\\\( K \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\) are constants) at some time after the initial transformation, will the new transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\) still be representative solely of transformations due to properties of \\\\( F(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the original function in both amplitude and offset, leading to a new transform \\\\( H(s) = K*F(s) + \\\\frac{d}{s} \\\\). This transformation incorporates changes not only influenced by the original \\\\( F(s) \\\\) but also by the multiple effects due to the constants \\\\( K \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
