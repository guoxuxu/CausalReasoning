  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is a complex initial condition. We look into the effects of applying the Laplace transform and its inverse affect the function over time t.\n\nGiven the observation of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after it has undergone the interventions of Laplace transformation and \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\), can we determine precisely if both, one, or none of these transformations were applied based only on \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions from the final observation \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone is challenging without additional information. Both the Laplace transform, its inverse, and the square transformation could contribute to the final state, and discerning their individual impacts requires more than the endpoint data due to the potential overlap in effects these transformations can create.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition z_0 and the frequency ω directly cause the function z(t). The function z(t) evolves over time to become z(T). Applying the Laplace transform causes a transformation of z(t) resulting in transformed_z. Applying the function h to transformed_z results in h(transformed_z). Both transformations together ultimately lead to z(T)."
