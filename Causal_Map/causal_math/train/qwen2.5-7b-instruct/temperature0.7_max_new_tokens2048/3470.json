  "Problem": "Consider a complex integration scenario described by a contour integral \\\\(\\\\int_C f(z)\\\\, dz\\\\) around a closed path C in the complex plane, where \\\\(f(z) = \\\\frac{e^{az}}{z^2 + 1}\\\\) and \\\\(a\\\\) is a real constant. The Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}\\\\) is used to analyze the integral in terms of real time dynamics.\n\nObserving a change in the value of the contour integral \\\\(\\\\int_C f(z)\\\\, dz\\\\), can we definitely conclude there was a change in the parameter \\\\(a\\\\) without any information on interventions?",
  "Explanation": "While a change in \\\\(a\\\\) can affect the integral, other factors could also alter the outcome, such as changes in the path C or even external transformations not accounted in the scenario. Without additional information, we can't exclusively attribute changes to \\\\(a\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The contour C influences the value of the contour integral ∫_C f(z) dz, which depends on the function f(z) that in turn is determined by the parameter a. The Laplace transform of f(t) is derived from ∫_C f(z) dz."
