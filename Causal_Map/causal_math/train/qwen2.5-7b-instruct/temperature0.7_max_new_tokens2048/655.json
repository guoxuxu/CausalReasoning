  "Problem": "Consider a continuous system described by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t + a(x,t) u_x = 0\\\\), where \\\\(a(x,t)\\\\) is a function describing the velocity at point x and time t. We examine the effect of an integral transform, specifically the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi,t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i x \\\\xi} u(x,t) dx\\\\).\n\nIf an intervention is applied at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), modifying the velocity function to a new \\\\(a'(x,t)\\\\) for \\\\(t > t_1\\\\), will the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi,T)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) still provide an accurate reflection of the system evolution based solely on the initial velocity function \\\\(a(x,t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the velocity profile, directly affecting advection characteristics and thus affecting the Fourier transform's phase shift and amplitude. The Fourier transform at \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) will encapsulate effects from both the original and altered velocity profiles, making it dependent on both.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial velocity function a(x,t) directly influences the partial derivatives u_t and u_x, which in turn determine the system state u(x,t). The Fourier transform F(u)(ξ,t) of the system state accurately reflects the system's evolution until t1, but after t1, changes in the velocity function to a'(x,t) alter the system dynamics, making F(u)(ξ,T) for T > t1 no longer reflective of the initial velocity function a(x,t)."
