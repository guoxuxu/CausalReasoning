  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\frac{dy}{dt} = By \\\\), where A and B are scalar constants. A transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant scalar, is analyzed for its effects over time t.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), we cannot distinguish if the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was solely influenced by A and B, or if C also played a role early on. Different combinations of A, B, and C could yield the same end state at t = T, complicating backward deduction.",
