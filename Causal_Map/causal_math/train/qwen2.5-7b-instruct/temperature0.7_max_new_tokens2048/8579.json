  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving in a potential V(x) in one dimension governed by the Hamiltonian \\\\( H = \\\\frac{p^2}{2m} + V(x) \\\\). We investigate the effect of a linear transformation of the momentum variable \\\\( p \\\\) by a function \\\\( g(p) = ap \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant scaling factor.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(p) = bp \\\\) (where \\\\( b \\\\) is another constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the original Hamiltonian H and not on a or b?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(p) \\\\) introduces another scale factor that modifies the momentum again, affecting the kinetic energy and thus the trajectory. Consequently, the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) depends on the values of a and b as well as the original Hamiltonian H.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying g(p) = ap changes the momentum to p', which then influences the endpoint x(T) through the Hamiltonian H. Applying h(p) = bp after g(p) further changes the momentum to p'', but since p'' is derived from p' via a linear transformation, the endpoint x(T) depends only on the initial Hamiltonian H and not on the specific values of a or b."
