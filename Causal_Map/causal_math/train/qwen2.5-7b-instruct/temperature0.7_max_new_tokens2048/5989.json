  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) described by a pair of coupled differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax - By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Bx + Ay \\\\), where A and B are constants. Explore the effects of an integral transformation \\\\( T[z(t)] = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s}z(s) ds \\\\) on this system over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( T[z(t)] \\\\) is applied to the complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and allowed to evolve under the prescribed differential equations without additional intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T be equivalent to the direct evolution of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under the same differential equations to time T?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T[z(t)] \\\\) alters the initial trajectory of the complex function. This transformation modulates the function by an exponential decay factor, fundamentally affecting the dynamics and resulting in a state which differs from that derived by plain differential evolution.",
