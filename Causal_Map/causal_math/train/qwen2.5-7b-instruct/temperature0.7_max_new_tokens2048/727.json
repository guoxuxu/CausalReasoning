  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, where \\\\( z(x) = e^{ix} \\\\). We study the integral transformation \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) over complex variable s and real variable t.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by multiplying it with another function \\\\( g(t) = e^{-\\\\beta t} \\\\), will \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at s equal to \\\\( i + \\\\beta \\\\) solely depend on \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) and not on the original function form?",
  "Explanation": "While \\\\( g(t) \\\\) modifies the integral, the resulting transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) will now depend on both the original function parameters (like \\\\( i \\\\) in \\\\( e^{ix} \\\\)) and the intervention parameter \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\). The transformation is a convolution of effects from both the original and the intervening functions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Modifying z(t) with g(t) changes Z(s), and setting s to i + β isolates Z(s) to depend only on β."
