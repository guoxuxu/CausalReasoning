  "Problem": "Consider a heat equation system described by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a constant thermal diffusivity. Examine the impact of applying a transformation with the function \\\\( f(u) = u + e^{At} \\\\) where \\\\(A\\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new intervention via function \\\\( g(u) = u + e^{Ct} \\\\) (where \\\\(C\\\\) is a constant matrix) is applied, will the endpoint \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\(k\\\\) and not on \\\\(A\\\\) or \\\\(C\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention implies adding another exponential term \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), which introduces additional dynamics into the system. Therefore, the final state of the system at \\\\( T \\\\) will be a function of kinetic constant \\\\( k \\\\), as well as the matrix constants \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\), due to their respective influences through the initial and intervention transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
