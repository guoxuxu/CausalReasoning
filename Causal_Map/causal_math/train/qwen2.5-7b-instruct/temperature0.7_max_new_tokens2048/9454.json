  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant. We look into how the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), with \\\\( B \\\\) also a real constant, affects \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nAfter observing the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, is it possible to precisely backtrack to the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing if \\\\( h(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), determining the exact original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) cannot be certain. The transformation \\\\( e^{iBt} \\\\) adds a phase shift which, without the value of B, creates ambiguity in reconstructing \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from the state at T.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z at time t is influenced by the rate of change of z (A → \\dot{z}), the time t, and the constant B through the function h(z) = e^(iBt)z. The rate of change of h(z) is influenced by B and t."
