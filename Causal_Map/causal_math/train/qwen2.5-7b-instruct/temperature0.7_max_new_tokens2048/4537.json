  "Problem": "A complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is defined where \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\). The transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied, and the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is studied under this transformation over time.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 = e^{i0} \\\\) at t = 0, and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is allowed to evolve without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) alters the initial state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) by squaring it, which changes the angle from 0 to 0 (still 1 at t=0 but the nature of trajectory changes as it effectively doubles the angular velocity). Thus, at any subsequent time T, \\\\( z(T) \\\\) in the transformed case would be \\\\( e^{2iT} \\\\), whereas in the untransformed case, it would be \\\\( e^{iT} \\\\), leading to a frequency doubling effect.",
