  "Problem": "Consider a linear system with complex function mappings characterized by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\), where D is a constant matrix. We examine the effect of the transformation described by the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) where C is another constant matrix affecting complex functionalities.\n\nIf, at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( j(z) = e^{Et}z \\\\) (where E is a distinct constant matrix) is introduced as an intervention, will the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 solely depend on matrix D and not matrices C or E?",
  "Explanation": "The final condition of the complex function \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on the effects of matrices D, E, and potentially C. The original and intervening transformations \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Et} \\\\) influence the overall behavior and endpoint by modifying the trajectory of the system, making it dependent on all applied transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z at time t_1 is influenced by matrix D, but the end state z(T) for T > t_1 depends only on matrix D and not on matrices C or E, since z(t_1) is the initial condition for the subsequent evolution governed by D."
