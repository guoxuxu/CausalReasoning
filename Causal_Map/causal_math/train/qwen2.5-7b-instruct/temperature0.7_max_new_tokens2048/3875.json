  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system characterized by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We investigate the effect of the operator \\\\( F(x) = S^{-1}e^{Kt}Sx \\\\) over time t, where K is another diagonalizable matrix and S is the transformation matrix that diagonalizes D.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) an intervention \\\\( G(x) = S^{-1}e^{Mt}Sx \\\\) (where M is another constant matrix) is applied, will the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on D and not on K or M?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( G(x) \\\\) introduces an additional transformation governed by M, and since S, K, and M are involved, the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at any time post-intervention is affected by these matrices as well as D. The state's evolution is influenced significantly by the interactions of these transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
