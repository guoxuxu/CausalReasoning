  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z = f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2\\\\) in a complex domain where \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\) are complex variables. Analyze how linear transformations \\\\(T(x, y) = (ax + by, cx + dy)\\\\) (where \\\\(a, b, c, d\\\\) are constants) affect the function.\n\nIf a new transformation \\\\(U(x, y) = (px + qy, rx + sy)\\\\) is applied as an intervention at some point during the process, will the final result of \\\\(f(x, y)\\\\) depend solely on the original matrix coefficients of \\\\(T\\\\), ignoring the coefficients from \\\\(U\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The subsequent transformation \\\\(U\\\\) further modifies the coordinates, making the final result dependent on the coefficients of both \\\\(U\\\\) and \\\\(T\\\\). The interplay of these transformations significantly affects the outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The linear transformation T(x, y) affects the value of z, and if U(x, y) is applied subsequently, it also affects z, but the final value of z depends on both T and U transformations."
