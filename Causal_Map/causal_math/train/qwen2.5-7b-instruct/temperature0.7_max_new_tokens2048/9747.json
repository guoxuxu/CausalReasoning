  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency. We analyze how transformations by the integral operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{z\\\\} = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{-st}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant, affect the solution over time.\n\nIf during the evolution, at some specified time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another integral transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{M} \\\\{z\\\\} = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{-qt}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), with a different complex constant \\\\( q \\\\), is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of the initial transformation by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{z\\\\} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( \\\\mathcal{M} \\\\{z\\\\} \\\\) introduces a new integral effect, which along with the initial transformation by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{z\\\\}, alters the subsequent evolution of the function. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on both transformations and cannot be considered independent of either.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The frequency ω determines the rate of change of z(t) with respect to time. The integral operator L{z} transforms z(t) into a new function evaluated at t1. The integral operator M{z} with a different constant q also transforms z(t) into a new function evaluated at t1. The value of z(T) for T > t1 is influenced by both L{z} and M{z}, and thus is not independent of M{z}."
