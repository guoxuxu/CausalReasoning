  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on complex numbers, \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We will study the changes in the function with respect to the integration operator over time defined as \\\\( F(t) = \\\\int_0^t z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), and analyze the influence of modifications by derivative with respect to time.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) an operation defined by \\\\( g(t) = z'(t) \\\\) (derivative of z with respect to t) is used as an intervention, will \\\\( F(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on the original function z without consideration of the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the derivative operation as an intervention partway through the interval modifies the value of the function thereafter, changing the integrand from \\\\( e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) to \\\\( i \\\\omega e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\). This change affects the remaining integral from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T, thus altering \\\\( F(T) \\\\) in a way that directly involves the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The derivative of z with respect to time (z'(t)) influences g(t), which in turn affects F(t). Directly, z(t) influences F(t), but the introduction of g(t) through the intervention of z'(t) modifies F(t) after time t_1."
