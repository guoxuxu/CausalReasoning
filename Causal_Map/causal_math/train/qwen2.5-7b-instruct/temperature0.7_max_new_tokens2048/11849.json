  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. We explore the effect of the linear transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), deducing \\\\( z_0 \\\\) solely based on the observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is infeasible. The transformation \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) affects the initial state, and without this information, we cannot determine if the observed state results from a transformed or original initial condition.",
