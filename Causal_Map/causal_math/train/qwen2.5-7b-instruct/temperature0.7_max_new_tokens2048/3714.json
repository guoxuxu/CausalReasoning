  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t, and governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\frac{du}{dt} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\frac{dv}{dt} = Bv \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. Investigate the effects of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another constant matrix.\n\nCan the initial complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be deduced after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on whether the initial condition was transformed by \\\\( f(z) \\\\), we lack critical information due to the potential alteration by \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\). Since \\\\( C \\\\), \\\\( A \\\\), and \\\\( B \\\\) can interact in complex ways, determining \\\\( z_0 \\\\) uniquely from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without this knowledge is unfeasible.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial complex vector z_0 directly influences z(t) at any time t, through the transformation e^(Ct) applied to z_0. The evolution of u(t) and v(t) over time, governed by A and B respectively, directly contributes to z(t). At time t = T, z(t) reflects the state of z_0 transformed by e^(CT)."
