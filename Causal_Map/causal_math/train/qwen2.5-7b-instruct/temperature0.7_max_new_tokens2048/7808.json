  "Problem": "Consider a complex function transformation of a vector space, where we use the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) defined by the operation \\\\( L(z) = pz + q \\\\) for complex scalars \\\\( p \\\\) and \\\\( q \\\\). We investigate how the transformation impacts the solutions of the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant matrix, over time t.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to distinguish precisely what transformations or interventions (whether \\\\( L \\\\), \\\\( G \\\\), or both) had been applied just by knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple sequences or combinations of transformations with \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( G \\\\), along with different compatible initial conditions under \\\\( M \\\\)'s dynamics, could lead to the same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Without complete trajectory or transformation details, specific interventions cannot be confidently back-traced.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation by the linear operator L (i.e., L(z)) and the evolution governed by the differential equation Mz both contribute to determining z(T)."
