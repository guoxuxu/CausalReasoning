  "Problem": "Consider the impact of the Laplace transform on the function \\\\( g(t) = te^{2t} \\\\) and how it behaves when inverse transformed under different modifications.\n\nIf \\\\( g(t) \\\\) undergoes a standard Laplace transform to \\\\( G(s) \\\\) and is then directly inverse transformed back to the time domain, will the resulting function be identical to \\\\( g(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform and its inverse are theoretically perfect inverses under ideal conditions, so applying the transform followed by its inverse should return the original function, \\\\( te^{2t} \\\\), provided all conditions of the transform are met (e.g., convergence).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
