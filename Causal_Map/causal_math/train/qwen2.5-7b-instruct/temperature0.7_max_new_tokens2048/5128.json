  "Problem": "Consider an electrical network involving a complex impedance function \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{s + a}{s^2 + bs + c} \\\\), where s is the complex frequency, and a, b, c are constants. An impulse response h(t) of this network is obtained through the inverse Laplace transform of Z(s).\n\nGiven the modified impulse response h'(t) at T, can we identify accurately what changes (alteration to 'a', 'b', or 'c' or any combinations thereof) were applied if only the final impulse response is known?",
  "Explanation": "The final impulse response h'(t) could result from various combinations of changes in parameters 'a', 'b', and 'c', and potentially their interaction effects too. Without additional information or constraints, it's infeasible to uniquely pinpoint the alterations made based solely on the observed h'(t).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
