  "Problem": "Consider a scalar linear time-invariant (LTI) system represented by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = kx\\\\), where k is a real constant. The Laplace transform of x(t) is used to obtain the transfer function, and various filters represented by transfer functions \\\\(H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+p}\\\\) are applied, where p is a pole introduced by the filter.\n\nIf at t = t_1, an additional filter with a different pole q is applied, will the output \\\\(x(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 be solely determined by the original system dynamics (constant k) and not by any filter properties (poles p or q)?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of another filter introduces a new dynamic element into the system. The output \\\\(x(T)\\\\) will depend on the interaction of both filters with the LTI system, reflecting the effects of both poles p and q along with the system's inherent dynamics represented by k. This compound effect alters the trajectory from what would be produced by just the underlying system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The output x(T) for T > t_1 is primarily influenced by the system dynamics (k) and the initial state x(t_1), but not directly by the poles p or q of the filters applied."
