  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by the Laplace transform \\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = \\\\frac{1}{s-p} \\), where \\( p \\) is a complex constant. We analyze the effects of changing \\( p \\) and the impact of convolution with another function \\( g(t) \\) represented by its transform \\( G(s) = e^{-qs} \\), where \\( q \\) is another complex constant.\n\nIf \\( p \\) is altered to \\( p + \\\\delta \\) where \\( \\\\delta \\) is a small complex number, and \\( F(s) \\) is evolved naturally without further changes, will the inverse transform \\( f(t) \\) at a later time display the same behavior as the original \\( f(t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The shift in \\( p \\) to \\( p + \\\\delta \\) alters the pole of the Laplace transform, modifying the decay or growth characteristics and oscillation frequency of the function \\( f(t) \\). Thus, the time-domain behavior of \\( f(t) \\) will fundamentally change.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Changing p to p + δ results in a modified F(s) which leads to a new f'(t) that differs from the original f(t)."
