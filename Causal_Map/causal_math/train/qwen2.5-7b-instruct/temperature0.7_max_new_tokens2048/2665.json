  "Problem": "Consider a continuous system described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -kz \\\\), where k is a positive constant. The system undergoes an analysis involving a Fourier transform defined by \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the frequency variable.\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( z(0) = z_0 \\\\) is transformed using the Fourier transform and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -kz \\\\) without further intervention, will the spectral composition at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) at time T be different from evolving the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) directly under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -kz \\\\) and then applying the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The spectrum of the system at any given frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) will be the same regardless of when the Fourier transform is applied. Transforming early or evolving first doesn't change the resulting spectrum because the system's linear response is solely dependent on the exponential decay factor \\\\( e^{-kt} \\\\), which commutes with the Fourier transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition z(0) directly influences z(t) through the differential equation, and also directly influences F(z)(ω) through the Fourier transform. F(z)(ω) then indirectly influences z(t) by defining its state at any given time t."
