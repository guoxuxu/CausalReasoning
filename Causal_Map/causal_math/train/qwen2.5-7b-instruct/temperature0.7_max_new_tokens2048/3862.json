  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = u(x, y) \\\\) where \\\\( u(x, y) = e^{x^2 + y^2} \\\\. Analysis involves exploring Fourier transform of \\\\( u \\\\), denoted as \\\\( U(f_x, f_y) \\), and how the frequency-domain behavior changes under specific transformations.\n\nGiven the Fourier transform \\\\( W(f_x, f_y) \\\\) of the shifted function \\\\( w(x, y) \\\\), is it possible to uniquely determine the original unshifted function \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\) without knowing the shift vector \\\\( v \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about the shift vector \\\\( v = (a, b) \\\\), the phase information alone from \\\\( W(f_x, f_y) \\\\) cannot uniquely reconstruct the spatial displacement in the function, as multiple shift combinations can result in the same phase shift.",
