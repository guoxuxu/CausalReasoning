  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the ordinary differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz + Cu\\\\), where D is a matrix representing the system dynamics, and C represents the control input effect. The focus is on examining system behavior with and without the forced input transformation given by function \\\\( h(u) = e^{Fu}u \\\\), where F is another constant matrix.\n\nIf an intervention using another function \\\\( i(u) = e^{Gu}u \\\\) (where G is a constant matrix) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on D and independent of F or G?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with function \\\\( i(u) \\\\) adds additional complexity, thereby making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) contingent on F and G, and on D. These transformations, \\\\( e^{Fu} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Gu} \\\\), influence the system's trajectory significantly and the final outcome, due to their distinct effects.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The end state z(T) depends on D and is influenced by C; F and G do not directly affect z(T) but influence h(u) and i(u) respectively, which are not applied after t_1."
