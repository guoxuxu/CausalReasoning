  "Problem": "Analyze the effect of a variable transformation using a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) on the integration path in the complex plane. Given a continuous function g(z), we examine the integral transformation from the function \\\\( \\\\int g(z)\\\\, dz \\\\) over a specific path P to \\\\( \\\\int g(f(z))f'(z)\\\\, dz \\\\) over the same path.\n\nWill the value of \\\\( \\\\int g(f(z))f'(z)\\\\, dz \\\\) over path P be equal to \\\\( \\\\int g(z)\\\\, dz \\\\) over the same path if no other transformation is applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) changes the function and the differential element through \\\\( f'(z) = ie^{iz} \\\\), thus altering the integral's value even over the same path due to the modification in both the integrand and the path dynamics in the complex plane.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation function f(z) maps z to f(z), and its derivative f'(z) scales the differential dz to f'(z)dz, thus the integral of g(f(z))f'(z)dz over path P changes the integrand but not necessarily the overall value without additional constraints."
