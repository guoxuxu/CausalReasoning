  "Problem": "Analyze the relationship between input function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and output function \\\\( y(t) \\\\) in a system governed by the convolution operation with an impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\), specified as \\\\( y(t) = x(t) \\\\ast h(t) \\\\). Consider two functions, \\\\( h_1(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h_2(t) \\\\), where \\\\( h_2(t) = t \\\\ast h_1(t) \\\\).\n\nIf the input function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is applied to a system with impulse response \\\\( h_1(t) \\\\) and then the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is processed through a system with impulse response \\\\( h_2(t) \\\\), will the overall output be the same as applying \\\\( x(t) \\\\) through \\\\( h_2(t) \\\\) directly?",
  "Explanation": "The overall output when first using \\\\( h_1(t) \\\\) then \\\\( h_2(t) \\\\) represents a doubly convolved system, akin to \\\\( x(t) \\\\ast (h_1(t) \\\\ast t) \\\\), which is different from directly using \\\\( h_2(t) \\\\), due to the additional convolution with \\\\( t \\\\) that modifies the signal.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The input function x(t) convolved with h1(t) produces y(t), and y(t) convolved with h2(t) produces y'(t). Since h2(t) is defined as t * h1(t), the overall effect of processing x(t) first through h1(t) and then through h2(t) is not equivalent to directly processing x(t) through h2(t)."
