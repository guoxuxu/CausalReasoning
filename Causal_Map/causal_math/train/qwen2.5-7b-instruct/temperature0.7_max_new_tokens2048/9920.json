  "Problem": "Consider an integral transformation on a function \\( u(x) \\) represented as \\( T[u(x)] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{st} u(t) \\, dt \\), where \\( s \\) is a complex number. We analyze the impact of changing the order of integration and differentiation operations under the transformation.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\( T[u(x)] \\), can one determine whether an intervention occurred, specifically if \\( u(x) \\) was replaced or modified by \\( v(x) + w(x) \\), only by analyzing \\( T[u(x)] \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing \\( T[u(x)] \\) alone does not typically reveal whether \\( u(x) \\)'s structure was altered by blending with other functions unless specific additional data about the nature of \\( v(x) \\), \\( w(x) \\), and their interaction with \\( s \\) is available.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
