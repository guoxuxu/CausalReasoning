  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable \\\\( z \\\\) given by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\), and its transformation by the contour integral along a path \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) in the complex plane. The integral transformation is described by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{\\\\gamma} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\xi - z} d\\\\xi \\\\), which depends on the path of integration \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at a certain point \\\\( z \\\\), can we infer if the path \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) encircled the origin based solely on observing \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The value of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) alone without additional path details or a complete knowledge of \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\)'s geometry cannot definitively confirm whether the origin was encircled due to the complex nature of paths in the complex plane and their potential to approximate various effects.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
