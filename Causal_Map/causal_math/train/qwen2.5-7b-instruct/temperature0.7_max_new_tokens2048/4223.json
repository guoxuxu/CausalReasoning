  "Problem": "Examine the behavior of a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) under the transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant. We assume \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are governed by differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Ay\\\\), where A is a constant matrix.\n\nIf a new transformation \\\\(k(z) = e^{-i\\\\omega t}z\\\\) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at t = T strictly depend on the matrix A and not on \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(k(z) = e^{-i\\\\omega t}z\\\\) introduces a counteracting phase shift, making the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) dependent not only on the matrix A but also on the original transformation \\\\(h(z)\\\\) and the intervention. The interaction of these complex exponentials affects the trajectory and final state of the system.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The state z(T) at t = T depends on matrix A through x(t) and y(t), but is independent of ω due to the applied transformation k(z) which counteracts h(z)."
