  "Problem": "Consider a linear system with complex function mappings characterized by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\), where D is a constant matrix. We examine the effect of the transformation described by the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) where C is another constant matrix affecting complex functionalities.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, is it possible to backtrack accurately to determine the original complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The trajectory leading to \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could have been altered by the exponential transformation \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\). Without knowing the specific influence of C, or whether it was applied, it is impossible to determine the exact initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) as both C and D influence the evolution in a non-trivial and possibly non-invertible way.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation h(z) and the dynamics described by Dz both lead to the state z(T) at time T. The original state z_0 directly influences z(T) through both transformations."
