  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ y(t) \\\\} = Y(s) \\\\) with a convolution operation defined by the function \\\\( g(t) = e^{-kt} \\\\), where k is a constant. The impact of initial and intermediate alterations using the convolution operation is studied.\n\nIf a new convolution with a function \\\\( h(t) = e^{-\\lambda t} \\\\) (where lambda is a constant) is introduced at time t1, will the final Laplace Transform \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) for T > t1 solely reflect the influence of h(t) and not g(t)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) adds another factor to the system, affecting the total transform as the convolution operation are associative but not independent. The result at \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) is therefore a combined effect of both \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\), altering the transfer function representation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Introducing a new convolution with h(t) at time t1 will affect Y(s) starting from t1, while the influence of g(t) before t1 will still be present in Y(s)."
