  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions evolving over time according to their respective differential equations, \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. An integral transform \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) is applied for causal analysis.\n\nIf an external control modifies \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_k \\\\) by a scaling factor \\\\( k \\\\), and then \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is computed for \\\\( t > t_k \\\\), does the resulting transform depend solely on the matrices A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by scaling at time \\\\( t_k \\\\) fundamentally alters the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), affecting both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\). The subsequent computation of \\\\( F(z) \\\\) therefore reflects these changes, incorporating effects from the intervention and making it depend on more than just the matrices A and B.",
