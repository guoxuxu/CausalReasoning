  "Problem": "Consider a differential equation representing the rate of change in the electrical potential V across a capacitor in an RC circuit, given by \\\\( \\\\dot{V} = -\\\\frac{1}{RC}V \\\\). A step function intervention via a voltage source modifies the potential by adding a function \\\\( h(t) = He^{Dt} \\\\), where H, D are constants and t is time.\n\nIf \\\\( V_0 \\\\) is the initial potential at t = 0 and evolves naturally under \\\\( \\\\dot{V} = -\\\\frac{1}{RC}V \\\\) without further intervention, is the potential at time t = T equal to that evolved from a different initial condition \\\\( V'_0 = V_0 + h(0) \\\\) using the same differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The initial condition affects the solution trajectory distinctly. Since \\\\( h(0) \\\\) modifies the initial potential, it results in a different trajectory notwithstanding the identical governing differential equation.",
