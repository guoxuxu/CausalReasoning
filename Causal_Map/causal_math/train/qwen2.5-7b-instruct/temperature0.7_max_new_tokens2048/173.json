  "Problem": "Examine a scenario involving a linear time-invariant system governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = Mx(t) \\\\) where M is a constant matrix. We consider the impact of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(x(t)) = X(\\\\omega) \\\\) on this system and its implications on system behavior.\n\nIf an initial condition \\\\( x(0) \\\\) is transformed via Fourier and then evolved according to \\\\( M \\\\) without further intervention, will the state of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at any given time t be predictable by solely using M and \\\\( x(0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the initial condition changes the representation of state from time domain to frequency domain, hence the subsequent system's behavior in time cannot be directly inferred using only M and the initial \\\\( x(0) \\\\) without considering the inverse Fourier transform and how M affects these transformed components.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
