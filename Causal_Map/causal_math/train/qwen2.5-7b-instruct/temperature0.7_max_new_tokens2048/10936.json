  "Problem": "Assuming a signal processing context where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed by a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) and subsequently passed through an integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[x](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}x(t)dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the final transform \\\\( T[M[Lx_0]](s) \\\\), is it possible to distinguish whether the intervention by \\\\( M \\\\) occurred before or after operator \\\\( L \\\\) was applied, using only the information from \\\\( T[x](s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the precise sequence of operations (whether \\\\( M \\\\) preceded \\\\( L \\\\) or vice versa) from the resultant transform alone would be complex without additional constraints or information about the nature of the operators and their effects on the signal due to overlapping effects in the Laplace domain, potentially resulting in the same transform for different orderings of \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of operator L to the input signal x(t) results in Lx_0, which is then modified by M to produce M[Lx_0], and finally transformed by T to yield T[M[Lx_0]](s). The integral transform T operates on the output of M[Lx_0]."
