  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\Delta u = 0\\\\) in a domain \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\). The domain boundary \\\\(\\\\partial\\\\Omega\\\\) has been split into two parts, where on \\\\(\\\\partial\\\\Omega_1\\\\) the function \\\\(u\\\\) is held fixed at zero, and on \\\\(\\\\partial\\\\Omega_2\\\\), a non-homogeneous Neumann boundary condition is applied involving the function \\\\(h(x)\\\\) by \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial n} = h(x)\\\\). We examine the effect of modifying the Neumann boundary condition by a function \\\\(g(x,t)\\\\) which depends on position and time.\n\nIf \\\\(h(x)\\\\) on \\\\(\\\\partial\\\\Omega_2\\\\) is replaced by \\\\(h(x) = kx\\\\) for a constant k without any further changes, will the solution \\\\(u(x)\\\\) in the domain \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\) be the same as with the original \\\\(h(x)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing \\\\(h(x)\\\\) to \\\\(kx\\\\) alters the Neumann boundary condition, which directly affects the normal derivative of \\\\(u\\\\) along \\\\(\\\\partial\\\\Omega_2\\\\). This change modifies the distribution of the flux across the boundary, leading to a different solution within \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of k directly causes the form of h(x), which in turn directly causes the Neumann boundary condition ∂u/∂n, ultimately influencing the solution u(x) in the domain Ω."
