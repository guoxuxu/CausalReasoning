  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) defined by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\partial_t u = D \\\\partial_x^2 u \\\\), where D represents a diffusion constant. We also consider the application of an integral transformation \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int e^{ikx} u(x, t) \\\\, dx \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a wave number.\n\nGiven the observed state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), can we determine exactly what transformations were applied (whether \\\\( T(u) \\\\), \\\\( S(u) \\\\), or both), by only knowing the final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific transformations based solely on the final observed state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) is not possible because various combinations of transformation applications can result in the same final state. The diffusion process does not uniquely 'mark' the transformations, and intrinsic properties of linear transformations like \\\\( T(u) \\\\) and \\\\( S(u) \\\\) can lead to overlapping effects on the solution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The diffusion constant D influences the change of u with respect to time (∂_t u). The second derivative of u with respect to x (∂_x^2 u) also influences the change of u with respect to time (∂_t u). The integral transformation T(u) results in the state u(x, T). The wave number k is used in the definition of the transformation T(u)."
