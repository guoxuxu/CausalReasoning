  "Problem": "Assess the role of the Laplace transform in a system governed by the partial differential equation \\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\nabla^2 u \\), where D is a diffusion constant. Analyze the outcomes when the function \\( h(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s + \\\\alpha} \\) (where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a positive constant) is applied as a Laplace transform modifier at initial and various times.\n\nCan the original spatial distribution \\( u(x,0) \\\\) be accurately inferred from observing \\( u(x,t) \\\\) at t = T if it is unknown whether \\( h(s) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without definitive knowledge of the Laplace transform's modification by \\( h(s) \\), distinguishing whether the exponential decay term \\( e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\) influenced the evolution is not feasible. This ambiguity prevents accurate back-calculation of the initial condition.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The diffusion constant D influences the rate of change of u with respect to time. The initial spatial distribution u(x,0) determines the spatial distribution u(x,t) at any later time t. Applying the modifier h(s) affects the temporal behavior of u(x,t). The value of α in h(s) influences the form of h(s). Without knowing if h(s) was applied, the original spatial distribution u(x,0) cannot be accurately inferred solely from observing u(x,t) at t = T."
