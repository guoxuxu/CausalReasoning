  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model for population growth under limited resources, described by the logistic differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dp}{dt} = rp(1 - \\\\frac{p}{K})\\\\), where \\\\(p\\\\) is the population, \\\\(r\\\\) is the intrinsic growth rate, and \\\\(K\\\\) is the carrying capacity. We explore the impact of a harvesting rate represented by a function \\\\(h(p) = Hp\\\\), where \\\\(H\\\\) is a constant, that could be applied to the population over time.\n\nCan we identify the initial population \\\\(p_0\\\\) after observing the population \\\\(p(t)\\\\) at t = T without knowing the harvesting rate H?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the harvesting rate \\\\(H\\\\), it's impossible to accurately deduce the original population \\\\(p_0\\\\) since the harvesting intervenes directly and changes the initial condition that dictates the future population under the logistic growth formula.",
