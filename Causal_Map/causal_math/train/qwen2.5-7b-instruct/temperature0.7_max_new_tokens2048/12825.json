  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function f(z) where z is a complex number. The function is given by \\\\( f(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\) where A is a real-valued square matrix. This function represents an operator acting on z over time, and we examine the effect of applying an integral transformation with a kernel function \\\\( K(w, z) = e^{iw^T B z} \\\\), where B is also a real-valued square matrix and w is another complex variable.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) obtained at time T, can we uniquely determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether any transformations acted on it through matrix A?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) potentially alters \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in a complex exponential manner that is dependent on A. Without knowing A, the reverse transformation from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely or accurately determined, as the effects induced by A are unknown or untraceable.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "z_0 → z(T); A → f(z); f(z) → z(T); K(w, z) → integral transformation; integral transformation → z(T)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state z_0 is transformed by the function f(z) which is influenced by the matrix A, resulting in the final state z(T). An integral transformation using kernel K(w, z) further modifies z(T), leading to the observed final state."
