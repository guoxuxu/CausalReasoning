  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) representing a solution to the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u) \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. We investigate the effect of applying the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at different times \\\\( t \\\\), denoted by \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t)) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) and the transformed function is evolved under the transformed equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\hat{u}}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\hat{L}(\\\\hat{u}) \\\\), will \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, T) \\\\) for a given T strictly equal the Fourier transform of the function obtained by directly evolving \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) to \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) under \\\\( L \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Fourier transform is a linear and time-invariant transformation, and given that the transformed equation accurately reflects the dynamics under \\\\( L \\\\), the evolution of \\\\( \\\\hat{u} \\\\) will correspond to the Fourier transform of the solution by direct evolution of \\\\( u \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "u(x, 0) → u(x, t); u(x, 0) → hat{u}(ω, t); hat{L}(hat{u}) → d/dt hat{u}; L(u) → d/dt u",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Fourier transform to the initial condition u(x, 0) and evolving it under the transformed equation results in a function hat{u}(ω, t) that, at time T, is equivalent to the Fourier transform of the function u(x, T) evolved from u(x, 0) under the original equation."
