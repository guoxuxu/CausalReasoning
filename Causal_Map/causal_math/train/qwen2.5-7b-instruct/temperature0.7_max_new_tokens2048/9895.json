  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\(z\\\\), respectively. The evolution of \\\\(z\\\\) is determined by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Sz\\\\), where S is a constant complex number. We examine the effect of a transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{Kt}z\\\\) where K is another constant complex number.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\(t_1\\\\), a new function \\\\(g(z) = e^{Mt}z\\\\) (where M is a constant complex number) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on S and not on K or M?",
  "Explanation": "Both transformations \\\\(e^{Kt}\\\\) and \\\\(e^{Mt}\\\\) significantly influence the trajectory and endpoint of \\\\(z(T)\\\\). The inclusion of M as an intervention means that the final state is contingent on the cumulative effects of S, K, and M, altering both growth and phase of the trajectory.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
