  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We explore the effects of linear operators \\\\( L \\\\) on this system, defined by matrix multiplication on complex numbers in the form \\\\( Lz = Mz \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant complex matrix.\n\nKnowing only the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), can we determine exactly what interventions were applied (whether \\\\( L \\\\), \\\\( L' \\\\), or both), without additional data?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple sequences or combinations of interventions \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( L' \\\\) could potentially yield the same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The absence of commutativity in matrix multiplication and the potential similarity transformations make it infeasible to conclusively infer the specific interventions from the endpoint alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
