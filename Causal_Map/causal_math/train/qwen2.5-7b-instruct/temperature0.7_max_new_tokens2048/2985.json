  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear operator. We explore the impact of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) which converts function u(x, t) into its frequency components U(k, t).\n\nIf \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) is applied to an initial function \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) and then allowed to evolve according to \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = Lu\\\\) without further intervention, will the function \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) was directly evolved to T under \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = Lu\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) to the initial condition and then evolving the frequency components under L does not change the physical system's properties or the linear operator's application. The inverse Fourier transform will recover the same state as evolving the original function directly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Fourier transform to the initial function u_0(x) results in U(k, t), which, when evolved according to ∂_t u = Lu, leads to u(x, t). This evolution from u(x, 0) to u(x, T) under ∂_t u = Lu is equivalent to directly evolving u_0(x) to u(T) under the same PDE."
