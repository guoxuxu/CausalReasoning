  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), representing a signal in the frequency domain, where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The system is then transformed by the integral transformation \\\\( T[z] = \\\\int_0^T e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\), taking place over a duration T.\n\nCan we deduce the presence of the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) in the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by merely observing the output of \\\\( T[z] \\\\) without knowing its original form?",
  "Explanation": "The output by itself, especially if it is zero, does not provide enough information to uniquely determine the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) since it can result from any sinusoidal frequency integral over its complete cycles. Distinct frequencies can yield zero if their integral period fits into T.",
