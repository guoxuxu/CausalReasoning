  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, governed by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. The function is subjected to a Fourier Transform, defined by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt\\\\).\n\nBased solely on the Fourier Transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(z)(\\\\omega)\\\\) at a specific frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), can we accurately deduce the initial conditions of \\\\(x_0\\\\) and \\\\(y_0\\\\) without knowing the matrices A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform, while revealing certain frequency components of \\\\(z(t)\\\\), does not provide enough information to uniquely reconstruct the initial states \\\\(x_0\\\\) and \\\\(y_0\\\\) without additional information about the matrices A and B, which dictate the evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
