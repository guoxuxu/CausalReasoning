  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) described by a pair of coupled differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax - By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Bx + Ay \\\\), where A and B are constants. Explore the effects of an integral transformation \\\\( T[z(t)] = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s}z(s) ds \\\\) on this system over time t.\n\nCan we conclusively determine the original function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) having evolved under \\\\( T[z(t)] \\\\) and the given differential equations, without explicit knowledge about the application of \\\\( T[z(t)] \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The effect of the integral transformation introduces a memory of all past states weighted by an exponential decay, which obscures the original state. Not knowing whether the transformation was applied means we cannot uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) since the transformation could have significantly altered the evolution path.",
