  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a complex function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency, and \\\\(k\\\\) is a constant complex number. We analyze the effect of the Laplace transformation \\\\(L(z(t)) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt\\\\) on this dynamic.\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\(z(0)\\\\) is given and no intervention is applied, will the Laplace transform of the system's response, \\\\(L(z(t))\\\\), be solely determined by the parameters \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and \\\\(k\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The system's evolution described by the differential equation is deterministic when the initial condition and parameters \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and \\\\(k\\\\) are known. The Laplace transform, being a linear operation, will uniquely transform the solution based on these parameters without requiring additional information.",
