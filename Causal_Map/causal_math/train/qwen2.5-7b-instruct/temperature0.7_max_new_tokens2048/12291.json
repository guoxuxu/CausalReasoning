  "Problem": "Examine the causal relationship in a scenario where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) undergoes various transformations. Initially, we have a Fourier transform applied to the signal, \\\\( F(x)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega t} x(t) dt \\\\). Afterwards, we evaluate the impact using a filter function \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\), which might be an intervention in the frequency domain.\n\nGiven the output signal after the application of both the Fourier transform and a filtering operation with a known \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\), can we ascertain whether any specific modifications (filtering interventions) were implemented just by analyzing the final signal?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the convolution theorem, and the potential for different original signals or filters to produce similar outcomes in signal transformations, accurately pinpointing the specific filter or confirming its use solely from the output can be indeterminate without additional information about the original signal or the nature of interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The original signal x(t) is transformed into its frequency domain representation F(x)(ω) through the Fourier transform. This frequency domain signal is then modified by the filter function H(ω), resulting in the filtered signal H(ω)F(x)(ω), which is eventually inverse-transformed back to the time domain to produce the output signal y(t)."
