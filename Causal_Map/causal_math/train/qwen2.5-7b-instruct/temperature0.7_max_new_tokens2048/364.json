  "Problem": "We examine a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( L\\{f(t)\\} = F(s) \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent function and \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is its transform in the s-domain. Consider the impact of a convolution operation with another function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) which also has Laplace transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\).\n\nKnowing the final transform \\\\( J(s) \\\\), can we determine precisely which function or combination of functions (between \\\\( f(t) \\\\), \\\\( g(t) \\\\), and \\\\( h(t) \\\\)) were convoluted, assuming the convolution could occur in any order?",
  "Explanation": "The final transform \\\\( J(s) \\\\) being a product of several functions’ transforms does not provide information about the specific sequence or individual functionality of these transforms due to the commutative property of multiplication in the s-domain. Therefore, multiple convolution orderings and combinations can yield the same product, leading to ambiguity in determining the precise convolution sequence or individual functions involved.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
