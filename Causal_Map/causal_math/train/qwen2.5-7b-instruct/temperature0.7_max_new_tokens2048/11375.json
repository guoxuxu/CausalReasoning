  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\nabla^2 u\\\\), where c is a constant speed of wave propagation. We explore the effects of a transformation using Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\omega) \\\\), especially its impact on the solution characteristics over time.\n\nIf an intervention with another transformation, say, a Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(u)(s)\\\\), is applied at a time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the essential wave characteristics of \\\\(u(T, x)\\\\) for T > t_1 be dependent just on the initial Fourier transform and not on the Laplace transform?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform as an intervention modifies the system differently by altering the role of different temporal components, influencing growth or decay in the system. Consequently, \\\\(u(T, x)\\\\) depends on both the initial Fourier transformation and the later Laplace transformation due to their effects on multiple characteristics of the wave.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
