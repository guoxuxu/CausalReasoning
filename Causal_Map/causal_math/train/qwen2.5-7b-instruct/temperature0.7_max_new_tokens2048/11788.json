  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\) where \\\\(\\omega\\\\) is a real number. To analyze causal effects, we introduce interventions using the transformation \\\\(g(z) = e^{Ct}z\\\\), where \\\\(C\\\\) is a complex number.\n\nIf \\\\(g(z)\\\\) is applied to the complex function at \\\\(t = 0\\\\) and then allowed to evolve under the original function without further intervention, will the state of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\) be identical to if \\\\(z(0)\\\\) evolved directly to \\\\(t = T\\\\) under the original system?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(g(z)\\\\) at the beginning modifies the initial state to \\\\(e^{Ct}z(0)\\\\), significantly altering the trajectory from what it would be under just \\\\(e^{i\\omega t}\\\\). The transformation due to \\\\(C\\\\) interacts with the original system and changes the evolution path, resulting in a different state at any future time \\\\(T\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z(t) is influenced by Ct, ω, and t. Applying g(z) at t=0 changes the initial condition of z(t), affecting its evolution over time."
