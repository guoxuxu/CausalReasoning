  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) mapping from time \\\\( t \\\\) in the complex plane to a complex number \\\\( z \\\\). The transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied to process the output at different times.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) evolves naturally from \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( t = T \\\\) without applying the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\), will the output at \\\\( t = T \\\\) be equivalent to the output obtained by applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and then evolving naturally to \\\\( t = T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) alters the function at the initial point. Applying it at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) squares the initial point, affecting the subsequent evolution because the complex exponential trajectory changes.",
