  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where the function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}x\\\\) defines a transformation in the complex plane, with \\\\(x\\\\) as an initial complex number and \\\\(\\omega\\\\) as a real constant frequency. We explore the effects of the Fourier transform \\\\(\\mathcal{F}\\\\) on this function and the implications on the frequency-domain representation.\n\nIf the function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}x\\\\) is Fourier transformed over time t, will the peak in the frequency spectrum occur at \\\\(\\omega\\\\) without additional operations?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\(e^{i\\omega t}x\\\\), where \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(\\omega\\\\) are constants, directly extracts the frequency components of the signal. The result is a delta function at frequency \\\\(\\omega\\\\), indicating a peak in the frequency spectrum exactly at \\\\(\\omega\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of omega directly influences the frequency content of z(t), and the Fourier transform of z(t) will have a peak at omega. The initial complex number x scales the amplitude but does not change the frequency location."
