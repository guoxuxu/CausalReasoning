  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the iterated integral transformation \\\\(\\mathcal{L}(f(x)) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}(\\int_0^t f(u) du) dt\\\\), where \\\\(f(x)\\\\) is a complex function. We examine the impact of modifying \\\\(f(x)\\\\) by a transformation \\\\(g(f(x)) = f(x) + ce^{dx}\\\\), where c and d are constants.\n\nIf \\\\( g(f(x)) \\\\) is applied to function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and then the system is operated under \\\\(\\mathcal{L}\\\\) over time without further intervention, will the output \\\\( \\mathcal{L}(g(f(x))) \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( \\mathcal{L}(f(x)) \\\\) was directly computed?",
  "Explanation": "The modification of \\\\(f(x)\\\\) by adding \\\\(ce^{dx}\\\\) alters the input to the integral transform. The output \\\\( \\mathcal{L}(g(f(x))) \\\\) includes the effect of the exponential term, which modifies the convolution within the Laplace-like integral.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Modifying f(x) with g(f(x)) = f(x) + ce^(dx) changes the input to the Laplace transform operator L, thus L(g(f(x))) will not be the same as L(f(x)) unless c and d are such that the additional term ce^(dx) does not affect the integral."
