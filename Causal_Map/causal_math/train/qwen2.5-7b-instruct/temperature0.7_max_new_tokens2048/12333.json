  "Problem": "Evaluate the causal impact in a nonlinear system characterized by the function \\\\( z = f(x,y) = x^2 + 3xy + y^2 \\\\), where \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are variables. We consider the application of a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{z} \\\\) to variable \\( z \\).\n\nGiven \\( g(z) \\) at a certain value, can we revert back to determine the exact values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) without knowing the transformation \\( g \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( g(z) = e^{z} \\) is not injective over the complex numbers, and multiple pairs of \\( (x, y) \\) might yield the same \\( z \\), thus the same \\( g(z) \\). Additionally, \\( e^{z} \\) exponentially increases with \\( z \\), making it sensitive to slight changes in \\( z \\) and effectively impossible to uniquely reverse engineer \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) without further information.",
