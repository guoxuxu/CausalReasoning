  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by the Laplace transform \\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = \\\\frac{1}{s-p} \\), where \\( p \\) is a complex constant. We analyze the effects of changing \\( p \\) and the impact of convolution with another function \\( g(t) \\) represented by its transform \\( G(s) = e^{-qs} \\), where \\( q \\) is another complex constant.\n\nCan we infer the original value of \\( p \\) after observing the behavior of \\( f(t) \\) at a later time without knowledge of any alteration to \\( p \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether \\( p \\) was altered (or by how much), reconstructing the original value of \\( p \\) from the evolved function \\( f(t) \\) is not feasible as multiple values of \\( p \\) can produce similar behaviors under certain conditions.",
