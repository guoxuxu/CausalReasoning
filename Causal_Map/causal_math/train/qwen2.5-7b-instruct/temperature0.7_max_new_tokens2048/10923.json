  "Problem": "Assume we have a system described by a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\) and A is a constant matrix. The influence of an integral transformation represented by \\\\( h(t) = (\\\\int_0^t e^{Bs} ds) x \\\\) over time t, where B is another constant matrix, is analyzed.\n\nIf an intervention is made at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) with a new function \\\\( k(t) = (\\\\int_{t1}^t e^{Cs} ds) x \\\\) (where C is a constant matrix), will the resulting state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the matrix A, and not on B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention using \\\\( k(t) \\\\) further modifies the evolution, introducing new dynamics. This makes the final state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on the interactions of matrices B and C with A, through their respective transformations of the state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
