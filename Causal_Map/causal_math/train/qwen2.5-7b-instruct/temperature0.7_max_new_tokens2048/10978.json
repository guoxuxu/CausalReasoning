  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where x and y are functions of time, t, subject to a linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = Az + B \\\\) with constant matrices A and B. The function z evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) where C is another constant matrix.\n\nAfter observing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was initially applied, can we reliably deduce the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the initial application of \\\\( T(z) \\\\), and given the linear transformation potentially alters the starting state, deducing \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) becomes ambiguous as both the transformation and the differential evolution alter the trajectory.",
