  "Problem": "Consider a complex function given by \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\) where \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) are real functions of time \\( t \\), obeying the differential equations \\( \\dot{u} = Au \\) and \\( \\dot{v} = Bv \\), respectively, with constant matrices A and B. We explore the effect of an integral transformation \\( \\mathcal{T}(z) = \\int_0^t e^{-\\lambda s} z(s) \\, ds \\) on this complex function over time.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\( \\mathcal{T}(z)(T) \\), can we uniquely determine the original function \\( z(0) \\) without knowing whether the integral transformation \\( \\mathcal{T} \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\( \\mathcal{T} \\), it is impossible to uniquely backtrack from \\( \\mathcal{T}(z)(T) \\) to \\( z(0) \\), as the transformation involves an integral that obscures direct causal relationships and introduces ambiguity.",
