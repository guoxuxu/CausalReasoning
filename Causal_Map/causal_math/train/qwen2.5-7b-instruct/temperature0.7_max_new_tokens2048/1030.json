  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that satisfies the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\partial_t u = D \\\\partial_{xx} u \\\\) where D is a diffusion constant. We explore the effects of the transformation \\\\( g(u) = u + e^{Ct} \\\\), where C is a constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(u) \\\\), identifying whether the initial condition included the exponential term \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) is not feasible. The changes induced by the transformation are not discernible solely from the final observation, unless explicitly modeled or known.",
