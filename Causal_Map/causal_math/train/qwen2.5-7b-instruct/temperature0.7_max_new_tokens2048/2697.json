  "Problem": "Examine the causality in a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + L(u) = 0\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We are considering the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) on the function \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\).\n\nIf a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, 0))\\\\) is computed at \\\\(t = 0\\\\) and the result is used as the initial condition that evolves according to \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + L(u) = 0\\\\), will the state \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\) be the same as if \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) was evolved without the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform alters the initial state into its frequency components, changing the evolution path of the function depending on the interaction between these components and the operator L. Consequently, the system's state at time T will differ.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state u(x, 0) influences u(x, t) through the differential equation. Applying the Fourier transform to u(x, 0) yields F(u(x, 0)), which then evolves to u(x, T) under the same dynamics. Without the Fourier transform, u(x, 0) directly evolves to u(x, T). The state u(x, T) will be the same in both cases if the Fourier transform does not alter the underlying dynamics."
