  "Problem": "Assume a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(u_t + Au_x = 0\\\\), where A is a constant matrix. Analyze the impact of the transformation defined by the operator \\\\(T(u) = e^{-Bx}u\\\\) across the spatial domain x, where B is another constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain point \\\\(x_1\\\\), a new operator \\\\(S(u) = e^{-Cx}u\\\\) (where C is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the state \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) for T > 0 depend solely on A and not on B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention using \\\\(S(u)\\\\) introduces an additional factor that modifies the system's state, making the final state \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) dependent on A, B, and C. The effects of \\\\(e^{-Bx}\\\\) and \\\\(e^{-Cx}\\\\) influence the system's evolution, affecting the final state at any point x and time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
