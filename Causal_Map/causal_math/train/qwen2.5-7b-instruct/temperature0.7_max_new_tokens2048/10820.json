  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}z_0 \\\\) where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real frequency. Assess the influence of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{-i \\omega \\tau} z(\\tau) d\\tau \\\\).\n\nGiven the state accessed through the transformation  \\\\( T(z(T)) \\\\), can we identify whether a frequency change intervention occurred, only based on the output at T?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transform \\\\( T(z) \\\\) may obscure details about changes in frequency due to its integral nature, averaging over phases and amplitudes. Thus, identifying specific interventions like frequency change purely from \\\\( T(z(T)) \\\\) isn’t feasible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
