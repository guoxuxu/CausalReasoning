  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant, representing angular frequency. An integral transformation defined by \\( T(z) = \\int_{0}^t e^{-i\\omega s}z(s) \\, ds \\) is applied to study its properties over time \\( t \\).\n\nAfter observing \\( z(T) \\) at time T, can we determine the form or effect of \\( T(z) \\) that was applied previously without further information?",
  "Explanation": "Observing \\( z(T) \\) alone does not provide any direct information about the transformation \\( T(z) \\) or its effects, as \\( z(T) \\) is not impacted by the transformation but solely by its own evolutionary dynamics \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The angular frequency ω influences the complex-valued function z(t) through the differential equation. The function z(t) is integrated over time to produce T(z), which depends on ω."
