  "Problem": "Imagine a function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the partial differential equation \\( \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t} + P(D)z = 0 \\), where \\( P(D) \\) is a linear differential operator. We study the effect of the Fourier transformation \\( \\mathcal{F}(z(t)) \\), which transforms \\( z(t) \\) into the frequency domain.\n\nIf an intervention in the form of an additional operator \\( Q(D) \\) affecting \\( z(t) \\) is applied at \\( t = t_1 \\), will the final frequency response \\( \\mathcal{F}(z(T)) \\) at \\( T > t_1 \\) be solely determined by the initial \\( P(D) \\) and not the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( Q(D) \\) introduces an additional influence on the evolution of \\( z(t) \\), affecting how \\( z(t) \\) transitions from \\( t_1 \\) to \\( T \\). This results in a modification of the frequency spectrum at \\( T \\), making \\( \\mathcal{F}(z(T)) \\) dependent on both \\( P(D) \\) and \\( Q(D) \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "P(D) influences the time derivative of z(t), and Q(D) also influences the time derivative of z(t). The combined effect of P(D) and Q(D) on the time derivative of z(t) determines z(t), which when transformed into the frequency domain by the Fourier transform becomes F(z(T))."
