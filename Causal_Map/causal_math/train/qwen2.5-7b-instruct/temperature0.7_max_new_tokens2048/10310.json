  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(w) \\\\) defined on the complex plane, represented by \\\\( z(w) = e^{iAw} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant matrix and \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex variable. We explore the behavior of \\\\( z(w) \\\\) under the integral transformation \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(w)e^{-sw} dw \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex parameter.\n\nAfter computing \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), can the original function \\\\( z(w) \\\\) at \\\\( w = w_0 \\\\) be uniquely determined?",
  "Explanation": "Given that Fourier transforms (a type of integral transform) are invertible under certain conditions, knowing \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) allows for the recovery of \\\\( z(w) \\\\) through the inverse Fourier transform, assuming the sufficient conditions for invertibility are satisfied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z(w) at w = w_0 directly determines the value of z(w_0); the integral transformation Z(s) depends on z(w); the original function z(w) at w = w_0 influences Z(s) through the integral transformation."
