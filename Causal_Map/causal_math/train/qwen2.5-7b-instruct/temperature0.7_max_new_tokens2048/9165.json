  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant. The function is then transformed using \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant, to study its behavior over time.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied at t = 0 to an initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\), and then allowed to evolve according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without any intervention, will the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to time T under the same differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) changes the magnitude of the initial condition, which modifies the trajectory of the function over time. The growth factor \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) compounds the effect of the oscillatory behavior governed by \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\), leading to a different magnitude and potentially different trajectory than if evolved directly.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition z_0 directly causes z(t) through the differential equation ω → dz/dt, while α → f(z) transforms z(t) but does not affect the direct relationship between z_0 and z(t) under the given differential equation. The function z(t) at time T will be the same whether it is directly evolved from z_0 or transformed by f(z) and then evolved, assuming no additional interventions."
