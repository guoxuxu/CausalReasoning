  "Problem": "Assume a differential equation governing the temperature \\\\( T \\\\) of a body over time is given by \\\\( \\\\frac{dT}{dt} = -k(T - T_{env}) \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a positive constant and \\\\( T_{env} \\\\) is the environmental temperature. Now consider a transformation \\\\( f(T) = T + h \\\\) applied at some initial time, where \\\\( h \\\\) represents a heating intervention.\n\nIf another intervention \\\\( g(T) = T - c \\\\) (where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant cooling effect) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final temperature \\\\( T(t) \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) depend exclusively on the initial temperature without considering the effects of \\\\( h \\\\) or \\\\( c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The sequence of transformations \\\\( f(T) \\\\) and \\\\( g(T) \\\\) influences the thermal trajectory. Both interventions change the baseline from which the temperature adjusts towards \\\\( T_{env} \\\\). As such, the final temperature depends on both the original temperature and the alterations made by \\\\( h \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The temperature T(t) is influenced by T_env, k, h, and c through the differential equation dT/dt = -k(T - T_env). The interventions h and c affect T(t) up to time t_1, after which only T_env, k, and the initial conditions matter."
