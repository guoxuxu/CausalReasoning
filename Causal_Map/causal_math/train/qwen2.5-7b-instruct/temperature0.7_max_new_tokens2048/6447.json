  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform, where the function \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t))(s) \\\\) represents the transform of a time-dependent function \\\\( f(t) \\\\). The impact of a linear operator \\\\( A \\\\) acting on \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to produce a new function \\\\( g(t) = A f(t) \\\\) is being analyzed, where the transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(g(t))(s) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention by another operator \\\\( B \\\\) is applied at a specific time converting \\\\( g(t) \\\\) to \\\\( h(t) = Bg(t) \\\\), will the final Laplace transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\) of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) only depend on \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with operator \\\\( B \\\\) adds another layer of transformation, making the final transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\) dependent on both \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\). The actions of \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) in the time domain collectively influence the resultant s-domain representation, demonstrating the dependency on both.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace transform of g(t) (G(s)) is influenced by operator A, while the Laplace transform of h(t) (H(s)) is influenced by operator B. Therefore, H(s) depends on B but not directly on A."
