  "Problem": "Analyze a system represented by the eigenfunction expansion \\\\( u(x, t) = \\\\sum_n a_n(t) \\\\phi_n(x) \\\\), where \\\\( a_n(t) \\\\) are the time-dependent coefficients and \\\\( \\\\phi_n(x) \\\\) are the eigenfunctions. An operation \\\\( F(u) \\\\) is defined as applying a differential operator, specifically \\\\( F(u) = -\\\\frac{d^2u}{dx^2} + cu \\\\), where c is a constant.\n\nGiven the observed state of the system at \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), is it possible to determine exactly whether \\\\( F(u) \\\\), \\\\( G(u) \\\\), or both were applied during the evolution from \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) to \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), solely based on \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The state at time T could result from varying effects of the operators \\\\( F \\\\) and \\\\( G \\\\), individually or in combination, due to their different impact on the system’s state. The possible combinations and their effects make it implausible to uniquely identify the interventions based solely on the final state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
