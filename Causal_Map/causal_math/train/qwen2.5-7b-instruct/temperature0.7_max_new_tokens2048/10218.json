  "Problem": "Consider the scenario where we study the effect of a complex function \\\\(f(z) = e^{z^2}\\\\) on the contour integral \\\\(\\\\oint_C \\\\dfrac{dz}{z-a}\\\\), where C is a closed contour around a point \\\\(a\\\\) in the complex plane.\n\nCan we infer the original function around the contour C from the modified integral result of \\\\(\\\\oint_C e^{z^2}/(z-a) dz\\\\), knowing only that a transformation of \\\\(f(z)\\\\) might have been applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge that \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied, and only observing the modified integral, it's impossible to definitively deduce whether the integral involved just \\\\(1/(z-a)\\\\) or \\\\(e^{z^2}/(z-a)\\\\), particularly without extra information about C and \\\\(a\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
