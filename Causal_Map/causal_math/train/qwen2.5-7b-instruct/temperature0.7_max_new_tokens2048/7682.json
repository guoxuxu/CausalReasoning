  "Problem": "Let's consider two complex functions \\( f(z) = e^z \\) and \\( g(z) = \\sin(z) \\) applied to a complex variable \\( z \\). The behavior of these functions under the Laplace transform is studied, where the transformation is denoted \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f\\} \\) and applied as an intervention.\n\nBased on the final state \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(T)\\} \\), is it possible to uniquely determine the initial value \\( z_0 \\) if only \\( f(z) \\) was applied and nothing else?",
  "Explanation": "Given the preservation of initial conditions through \\( f(z) = e^z \\) under Laplace transforms, the transform's inverse can be uniquely used to deduce \\( z_0 \\) from \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(T)\\} \\) accurately. The Laplace transform of exponential functions is well-defined and reversible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
