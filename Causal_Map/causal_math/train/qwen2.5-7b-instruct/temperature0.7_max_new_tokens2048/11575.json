  "Problem": "Analyze the feedback system characterized by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We investigate the effects of a transformation defined by \\\\( h(x) = Kx \\\\), where K is another constant matrix, applied at specific instances.\n\nIf at a certain time t = t1, a further transformation \\\\( j(x) = Nx \\\\) (N being another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t1 rely solely on M and not on K or N?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( j(x) = Nx \\\\) introduces additional effects into the system's dynamics. Hence, the final state at time T is influenced by the transformations due to K and N in addition to M. The endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is dependent on the compound effects of these transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
