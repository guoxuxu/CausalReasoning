  "Problem": "Consider a nonlinear system governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax^2 + Bx \\\\), where A and B are constant scalars. We explore the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sx} ds \\\\) on the system's behavior over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is applied to an initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, then the system is allowed to evolve according to \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax^2 + Bx \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T match that of an evolution from \\\\( x_0 \\\\) to t = T under the original system?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) alters the initial conditions, typically changing the integral curve of the differential equation. The new initial condition modifies not only the path but potentially the entire behavior of the system, especially given the nonlinearity introduced by \\\\( Ax^2 + Bx \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The integral transformation g(x) applied to the initial state x_0, along with the parameters A and B, directly influences the state x(t) at time t. A and B determine the system dynamics which in turn affect x(t), while g(x) modifies the initial condition leading to x(t)."
