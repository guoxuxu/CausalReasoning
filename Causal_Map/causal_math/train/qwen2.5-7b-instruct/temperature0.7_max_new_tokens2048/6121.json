  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by a complex function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant. The influence of an added Laplace transformation, defined by \\( f(z) = \\mathcal{L}\\{z\\}(s) \\), on the function \\( z(t) \\) is explored, where \\( s \\) is a complex variable.\n\nIf \\( f(z) \\) is applied to a function \\( z_0(t) \\) at t = 0, and then \\( z(t) \\) is allowed to evolve according to \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\) without further intervention, will \\( z(T) \\) at T > 0 be the same as if \\( z_0(t) \\) had evolved under \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\) directly?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform alters the frequency components of \\( z_0(t) \\) by transferring the function into the s-domain, which incorporates both growth and decay rates. This transformation changes the function's behavior fundamentally, and the resulting \\( z(t) \\) is not the same as would be attained by direct evolution under \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition z_0(0) directly influences z(t), which in turn determines z(T). Applying the Laplace transform f(z) to z(t) at t=0 does not change the evolution of z(t) under the differential equation, so z(T) will be the same whether z_0(t) evolves directly under the equation or after being transformed and then evolving."
