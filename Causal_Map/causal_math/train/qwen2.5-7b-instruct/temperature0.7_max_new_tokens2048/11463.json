  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function scenario where the initial function is \\\\( z(t) = C t^2 + iD \\\\), \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) being real numbers. The transformation applied is \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) over time t, with A being a real constant.\n\nIf an intervention by applying another function \\\\( g(z) = e^{B(T-t)}z \\\\) halfway through the evolution at \\\\( t = T/2 \\\\), will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be dependent only on initial parameters and not on both transformations \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( g(z) \\\\) further complicates the state by introducing another exponential factor dependent on \\\\( B \\\\) and time \\\\( T-t \\\\). The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) now depends on the initial conditions, the effect of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), and importantly, the subsequent application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
