  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function defined as \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\) where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant and \\( z_0 \\) is the initial complex number. We consider the impact of an integral transformation \\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\alpha s}z(s) \\, ds \\) applied to \\( z \\), where \\( \\alpha \\) is a real constant.\n\nIf the function \\( z(t) \\) is calculated from \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0 and allowed to evolve under the given definition without further transformation, will the transformed state \\( T(z) \\) at t = T be the integral of the simple exponential form \\( e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without any intervention, the transformation \\( T(z) \\) applied to \\( z(t) \\) will be directly the integral of \\( e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\) over the interval from 0 to T, following the initial definition of \\( z(t) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "z_0 → z(t); ω → z(t); t → z(t); α → T(z); t → T(z); z(t) → T(z)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial complex number z_0, through its evolution over time t with angular frequency ω, determines the state z(t). The constant α influences the transformation T(z) which is the integral of z(t) from 0 to t. Time t directly affects both z(t) and T(z)."
