  "Problem": "Consider a time-dependent electric field \\\\( E(t) \\\\) in a region, defined by \\\\( E(t) = E_0 e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( E_0 \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are constants. The response of a charged particle to this field is given by the differential equation \\\\( m\\\\ddot{x} = qE(t) \\\\), where \\\\( m \\\\) is the mass and \\\\( q \\\\) is the charge of the particle. We examine the impact of a damping force \\\\( -b\\\\dot{x} \\\\), where \\\\( b \\\\) is a damping coefficient, introduced at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\).\n\nIf the damping force is additionally applied at a later time t_0, will the final position of the charged particle at time T solely depend on the properties of the electric field (\\\\( E_0 \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)) and not on the damping coefficient \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a damping force changes energy dissipation and the overall equation of motion, leading to a new dynamic where the final position is affected by both the electrical characteristics and the damping coefficient, regardless of their temporal alignment.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The electric field E(t) and its properties E_0 and ω directly influence the position x of the charged particle through the equation m\\\\ddot{x} = qE(t); the damping force -b\\\\dot{x} influences x only if it is applied after t_0; the initial application of the damping force at t_0 does not affect the final position x(T) of the particle at time T, assuming no further forces act on the particle."
