  "Problem": "Consider a linear canonical transformation system governed by complex function integration \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At} w(t) dt \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and w(t) represents an external input function. We explore the effects of an integral transformation \\\\( h(w) = \\\\int e^{Bt} w(t) dt \\\\), where B is also a constant matrix, on the behavior of the system over time.\n\nConsidering the recorded output \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to precisely identify which transformations were applied to \\\\( w(t) \\\\) (whether \\\\( h(w) \\\\), \\\\( j(w) \\\\), and/or others), solely based on \\\\( z(T) \\\\)'s value?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations applied to \\\\( w(t) \\\\) through various exponential matrix functions are not necessarily unique in producing a specific output \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Multiple different transformation scenarios could lead to the same result, which makes pinpointing the exact interventions from the final state alone impossible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
