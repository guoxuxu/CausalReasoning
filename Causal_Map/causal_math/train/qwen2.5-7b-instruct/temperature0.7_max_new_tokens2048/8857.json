  "Problem": "Consider a complex system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial y^2} = -\\\\lambda u \\\\) with boundary conditions. We explore the system response under the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k_x, k_y, t) \\\\) and consider the dynamics when impacted by an operation \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(u) = e^{-i\\\\alpha t}\\\\hat{u}(k_x, k_y, t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the Fourier transform is applied to the initial function \\\\( u(x, y, 0) \\\\) and then allowed to evolve according to its natural dynamics given by the PDE, will the state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k_x, k_y, t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t \\\\) be reflective of the evolution as if the transform was not applied?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is a linear operator and preserves the dynamics under linear PDEs. Assuming the solution and its transform satisfy the same relation in the Fourier space, the transformed state will develop consistent with the PDE's natural evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial function u(x, y, 0) evolves over time to become u(x, y, t), which through the Fourier transform becomes hat{u}(k_x, k_y, t). Applying the operation hat{g}(u) to hat{u}(k_x, k_y, t) modifies it, but the state hat{u}(k_x, k_y, t) at time t reflects the evolution of the initial function as if the transform was not applied, considering the transformation and operation."
