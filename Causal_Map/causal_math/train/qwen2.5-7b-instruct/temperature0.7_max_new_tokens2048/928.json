  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\( x' = Dx \\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. Study the effect of the transformation \\( g(x) = S^{-1}e^{Lt}Sx \\) over time t, where L is another diagonalizable matrix and S is the matrix that diagonalizes D.\n\nGiven the final state \\( x(T) \\), can we precisely determine the interventions used (whether \\( g(x) \\), \\( h(x) \\), or both), solely by knowing the state \\( x(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\( x(T) \\) could arise from various combinations or sequences of the transformations \\( g(x) \\) and \\( h(x) \\). Due to the independence and differing effects of L and M on the evolution, and their non-commutative nature with D, it's impractical to specify exactly what interventions were employed just by observing \\( x(T) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation g(x) and potentially h(x) can influence the state x(T), but knowing only x(T) does not allow us to precisely determine which interventions were used."
