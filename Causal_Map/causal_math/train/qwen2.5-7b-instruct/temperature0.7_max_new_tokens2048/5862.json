  "Problem": "In a complex domain, consider a function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time \\\\( t \\\\), representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z \\\\), respectively. The time evolution of \\\\( z \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Hz \\\\), where \\\\( H \\\\) is a complex constant. We consider alterations in this system's behavior by applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Mt}z \\\\), with \\\\( M \\\\) being another complex constant.\n\nCan we determine the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) directly from observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T without knowing if the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it is impossible to uniquely determine the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) because the transformation \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\) could have changed the initial conditions in a way that is not recoverable from just observing the endpoint, due to the exponential interaction with the system's dynamics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z at time T (z(T)) causally influences the initial condition z_0 through the differential equation dynamics. The complex constant H governs the time evolution of z, while the transformation f(z) with constant M affects z but does not directly determine z_0 from z(T) alone."
