  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) defined on the complex plane, where \\\\(z(t)\\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = z^2 + c\\\\), with \\\\(c\\\\) being a constant complex number. Study the behavior of this system under the integral transformation \\\\(T_c(z) = \\\\int_0^t (z(s) + c) \\\\, ds\\\\), focusing on how \\\\(c\\\\) influences the trajectory.\n\nCan we infer the initial value \\\\(z(0)\\\\) after observing \\\\(z(T)\\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(T_c(z)\\\\) was applied during the interval?",
  "Explanation": "No, because the integral transformation may alter the path in a non-trivial way that depends on the evolution of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) and the value of \\\\(c\\\\). Knowledge of the transformation application is crucial for back-calculating the initial conditions.",
