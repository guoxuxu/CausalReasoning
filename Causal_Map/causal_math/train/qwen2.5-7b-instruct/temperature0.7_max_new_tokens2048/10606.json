  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are constant vectors. The function describes the combined influence of two transformations on initial vectors \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine the exact initial states \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and \\\\( y_0 \\\\) by only observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing \\\\( A \\\\) or \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the initial vectors \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and \\\\( y_0 \\\\) from the resulting state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without information about \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) is inherently difficult because the matrix exponentials transform each vector uniquely and their effects are superimposed in \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
