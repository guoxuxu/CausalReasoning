  "Problem": "Consider an electrical system governed by the Laplace transform of its input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\), giving \\\\( X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{x(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\. The output of the system is described by the function \\\\( Y(s) = H(s)X(s) \\\\), where \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is the system's transfer function. We examine the effects of modifying the input signal using the transformation \\\\( g(x) = x(t) * e^{-at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is applied to an input signal \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and then processed by the system without further intervention, will the output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) at any s be the same as if \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\) was directly processed?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) alters the Laplace transform of the input signal to \\\\( X(s+a) \\\\) from \\\\( X(s) \\\\), thus changing the input to the system to \\\\( H(s)X(s+a) \\\\). This results in a different output compared to directly processing \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\), which would have produced \\\\( H(s)X(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation g(x) to the input signal x_0(t) results in a modified input signal X(s), which when processed through the system with transfer function H(s), produces an output Y(s) that differs from directly processing x_0(t) due to the delay factor e^{-as} introduced by g(x)."
