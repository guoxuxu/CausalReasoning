  "Problem": "Examine the causal implications in the solution domain of the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az + Bz^2\\\\), where A and B are matrices. We will consider the effects of implementing an integral transformation defined by \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-Bs}s ds \\cdot z \\\\).\n\nIf the system state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is observed at some later time T, can we determine the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 unambiguously, without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( G(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( G(z) \\\\) could have altered the initial condition, and given the non-linearity introduced by \\\\( Bz^2 \\\\), multiple initial configurations might yield the same observed state at time T. Therefore, the exact initial state cannot be determined without knowing about the application of \\\\( G(z) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
