  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L u \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a differential operator. We examine the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F \\\\) to the initial condition \\\\( u_0 \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention is made by applying an inverse Fourier transform \\\\( F^{-1} \\\\) at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the system state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be solely determined by \\\\( u_0 \\\\) and not affected by the initial application of \\\\( F \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( F^{-1} \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) attempts to revert the system state back to a space similar to its natural configuration under \\\\( L \\\\), but any transformations or evolutions that happened between \\\\( t=0 \\\\) and \\\\( t_1 \\\\) under the disturbed state (post-initial \\\\( F \\\\)) will impact the system's trajectory subsequently. Thus, the state at \\\\( T \\\\) is affected by both initial and midway manipulations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
