  "Problem": "Consider the mathematical system where a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves based on the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real number, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the effect of a Fourier transform defined as \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\).\n\nGiven that the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) results in peaks at two frequencies, \\\\( \\\\omega = A \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega = B \\\\), can we determine which transformation occurred first: the original evolution under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\) or the intervention \\\\( G(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform presents cumulative information about frequency components without timestamps of when specific frequencies were introduced. Thus, it is indeterminable from the transform alone whether \\\\( A \\\\) or \\\\( B \\\\) was the original or the intervened frequency, as both manifestations are symmetric in the frequency domain.",

List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map_integration": "The original evolution under \\( \\dot{z} = iAz \\) determines the frequency \\( \\omega \\), which is then transformed by the Fourier transform \\( F(z) \\) into peaks. The intervention \\( G(z) \\) affects \\( z(t) \\), but does not directly cause the peaks without the Fourier transform."
