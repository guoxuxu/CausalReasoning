  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The function is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant complex number. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Dt}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is another constant complex number, influences the function over time t.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we deduce the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without the knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied, the integration and its effects introduced by \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) create ambiguities in back-calculating to \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The modification of the trajectory by \\\\( T(z) \\\\) obscures the initial condition.",
