  "Problem": "Consider a linear system characterized by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We explore how the application of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-ix\\\\xi} u(x,t) dx \\\\) affects the system.\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention via a Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(u) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( u(x, t_1) \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on L and omit the effects of Fourier and Laplace transforms?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the Laplace transform as an intervention alters the pathway of evolution due to the interplay between the Laplace and Fourier transformations. This generates a new function whose dynamics depend critically on both transformations, as well as the underlying operator L.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
