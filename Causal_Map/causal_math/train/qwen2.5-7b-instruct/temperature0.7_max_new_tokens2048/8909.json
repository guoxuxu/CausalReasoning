  "Problem": "Consider a continuous complex function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) governed by a differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{df}{dz} = izf(z) \\\\). We analyze the transformation of this function using a Fourier transform defined by \\\\( F(f)(s) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(z) e^{-isz} dz \\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier transform is applied to \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and then allowed to resolve under the given differential equation without intervention, will the transformed function \\\\( F(f)(s) \\\\) at time \\\\( t \\\\) be identical to directly transforming \\\\( f(z) \\\\) evolved to time \\\\( t \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the evolved system incorporates changes due to the differential equation's influence, shifting frequencies in the transformation. Due to the nature of the differential equation, which influences growth terms involving \\\\( iz \\\\), the transform of the function evolved over time differs from the original transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Fourier transform to the initial function f(z) results in F(f)(s), which evolves over time according to the differential equation; similarly, evolving f(z) directly to f(z,t) under the differential equation leads to a function that, when Fourier transformed at time t, results in F(f)(s,t). Thus, F(f)(s) transforms to F(f)(s,t) through evolution under the differential equation, paralleling the direct evolution of f(z) to f(z,t) followed by Fourier transformation."
