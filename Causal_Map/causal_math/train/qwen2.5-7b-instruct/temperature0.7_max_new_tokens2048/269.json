  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\) governed by the Cauchy-Riemann equations which ensure its differentiability in the complex plane. We examine the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under the effects of an integral transform \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At}z(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from t = 0 to T, will the resulting function at time T be holomorphic if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is holomorphic for all t in [0, T]?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) involves integration with the exponentiation of a complex matrix, which affects the holomorphic property of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The integral could potentially influence both the real and imaginary components in a way that violates the Cauchy-Riemann conditions at some point in the interval.",

  "causal_map_integration": "If z(t) is holomorphic for all t in [0, T], and A is a complex number, then T(z) is defined by the integral transform from 0 to T, and the resulting function at time T, T(z), will also be holomorphic."
