  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a capacitor of capacitance C, a resistor of resistance R, and a sinusoidal voltage source V(t) = V_0 e^{i \\\\omega t}. Using complex impedance for the circuit analysis, examine the effects of an intervention by introducing an inductor with inductance L midway through an observation period.\n\nHaving observed the steady-state current I(t) at time t = T, can one confirm the frequency \\\\omega of the voltage source V(t) without knowing whether an inductor was later introduced?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the inductor's introduction and its effect on the total impedance, one cannot reliably backtrack to determine the exact frequency of the voltage source from the steady-state current alone, as the inductor alters the overall system dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "V(t) → I(t); C → I(t); R → I(t); L → I(t)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The sinusoidal voltage source V(t) and the components of the circuit (capacitor C, resistor R, and inductor L) all directly influence the steady-state current I(t) at time t = T. Introducing an inductor L changes the circuit's impedance, affecting the current I(t), but observing I(t) alone is not sufficient to confirm the frequency ω of V(t) without additional information."
