  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear operator. We examine the role of the integral transform \\\\( H(u) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-sL}u(s) ds \\\\) applied to the function u over time t.\n\nIf a new operator \\\\( M \\\\) is applied at a specific time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\) as an intervention, modifying the system to \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Mu\\\\) for t > t_1, will the behavior of \\\\( u(T) \\\\) now solely be dictated by M, completely independent of whether \\\\( H(u) \\\\) was initially calculated?",
  "Explanation": "The initial computation of \\\\( H(u) \\\\) could have modified the system state before \\\\( t_1 \\\\), and a combination of the influences of L and M post-intervention still shapes the final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\). Both the initial condition affected by \\\\( H(u) \\\\) and the subsequent application of M contribute to the ultimate configuration at \\\\( T \\\\), indicating dependency on both.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Intervention by M after time t1 changes the behavior of u from being influenced by H(u) before t1 to being influenced by M after t1. Therefore, u(T) is influenced by both H(u) before t1 and M after t1."
