  "Problem": "Consider the system defined by the Laplace transform equation \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{y(t)\\\\} \\\\), where \\\\(y(t)\\\\) is an input signal and \\\\(s\\\\) the complex frequency variable. The system can be studied with an input modification where \\\\(y(t)\\\\) is transformed by \\\\( f(y) = y(t-a) \\\\), for some delay constant \\\\(a\\\\).\n\nGiven the final transformed output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\), can we conclusively determine the sequence or specifics of the delays implemented (whether \\\\( f(y) \\\\) or \\\\( f(z) \\\\), or both)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying which delays were applied (or in what order) from the final output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) is complicated due to the cumulative nature of the exponential shifts in the Laplace domain. These shifts, represented as multiplicative factors, do not uniquely encode the order or the individual values of delays. Thus, different sequences of delays can result in the same endpoint, leading to potential ambiguities in the causal inference.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
