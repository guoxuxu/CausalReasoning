  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation on a vector space using a matrix M and its exponential \\\\(e^{Mt}\\\\) which acts on vectors in the space. We investigate the effects of initial transformations \\\\(f(x) = e^{Nt}x\\\\), where N is another matrix, on the temporal evolution of vectors.\n\nIf you know the state of a particle at time T, \\\\(x(T)\\\\), can you determine unambiguously the initial conditions at t = 0 (i.e., whether \\\\(e^{Nt}x_0\\\\) or just \\\\(x_0\\\\) was used), knowing only that the evolution is governed by M?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of whether the initial transformation \\\\(e^{Nt}\\\\) was applied, the final state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) doesn't provide enough information to deduce the exact initial state (whether it was \\\\(e^{Nt}x_0\\\\) or \\\\(x_0\\\\)), especially since both transformations alter the trajectory potentially in a non-recoverable way.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state of a particle at time T (x(T)) causally influences the initial condition at t=0 (x_0) through the evolution governed by matrix M (M → e^{Mt}). The transformation e^{Nt} also affects the initial condition but independently of M's evolution."
