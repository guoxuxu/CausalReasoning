  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\) where D is a dynamically determined matrix. The system is subjected to operators \\( h(x) = Ce^{Ft}x \\) and \\( k(x) = Ke^{Gt}x \\) representing two types of interventions over time t with constant matrices C, F, K, and G.\n\nGiven the final state \\( x(T) \\), is it possible to clearly identify which interventions were applied, specifically whether \\( h(x) \\), \\( k(x) \\), or both were utilized based solely on knowing \\( x(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific interventions used to reach \\( x(T) \\) is complicated due to potential equivalencies in the matrix exponential outcomes and the overlap of effects from F and G with D. Diverse combinations of C, F, K, and G could lead to the same or indistinguishably similar final states due to these matrix effects, complicating backward resolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
