  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit described by the complex function \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{sC + \\\\frac{1}{sL + R}} \\\\), where \\\\( R \\\\), \\\\( L \\\\), and \\\\( C \\\\) represent the resistance, inductance, and capacitance, respectively. We investigate the impact of applying a Laplace transform to the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\), resulting in \\\\( X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\{x(t)\\} \\\\), and its effect on the system’s output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) in the Laplace domain, can we unequivocally determine the input \\\\( x(t) \\\\) used, assuming no other information about interventions or transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Recovering \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) without knowing specifically how \\\\( X(s) \\\\) correlates to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) or additional parameters used during the transformation (like initial conditions), introduces ambiguity. Multiple functions can yield the same Laplace transform, reflecting the potential for indeterminate inversion without further data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
