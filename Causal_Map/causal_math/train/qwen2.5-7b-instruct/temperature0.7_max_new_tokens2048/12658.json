  "Problem": "Consider a transfer function in control theory, described by \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{N(s)}{D(s)} \\\\), where \\\\( N(s) \\\\) and \\\\( D(s) \\\\) are polynomial functions of the complex variable s. We investigate the behavior of the system's output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) when the input \\\\( X(s) \\\\) is subjected to the Fourier Transform of a step function, i.e., \\\\( X(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s} \\\\).\n\nIf an additional filter described by \\\\( F(s) = e^{-sT} \\\\) (a time delay) is introduced at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) affecting \\\\( X(s) \\\\), will \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) at any time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) still represent the convolution of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) results in \\\\( X(s) \\\\) being modified to \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s}e^{-sT} \\\\), affecting the convolution process by shifting the phase of the input and thereby changing the output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\). The output will be a transitively modified version of the convolution between \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and the unmodified \\\\( X(s) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
