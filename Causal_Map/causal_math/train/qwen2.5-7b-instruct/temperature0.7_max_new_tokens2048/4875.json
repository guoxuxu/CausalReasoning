  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\Delta u = 0\\\\) in a certain domain with prescribed boundary conditions. Suppose an operator \\\\( T: u(x) \\\\mapsto u(x) + c \\\\cos(x) \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant, is applied externally.\n\nIf an intervention is applied where at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a function \\\\( S(u) = u - c \\\\cos(x) \\\\) is used, does the effect solely depend on the Laplace equation irrespective of \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Even though \\\\( S \\\\) appears to reverse the effect of \\\\( T \\\\), the interplay between both transformations and their timing relative to \\\\( t_1 \\\\) influences the solution. The system's evolution is not solely dependent on the Laplace equation but also on the effects and timing of applying \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( S \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An external operator T increases u, and an intervention S decreases u. The effect of S on u depends on the initial change caused by T."
