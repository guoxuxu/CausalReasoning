  "Problem": "In a physics experiment, a wave function \\\\( \\\\psi(x, t) \\\\) is modeled using the Schrödinger equation \\\\( i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial t} = H\\\\psi \\\\), where \\\\( H \\\\) is a Hamiltonian operator. We run simulations using an initial condition \\\\( \\\\psi_0(x) \\\\) modified by a function \\\\( f(\\\\psi) = e^{iKx}\\\\psi \\\\), with \\\\( K \\\\) representing a constant wave number.\n\nIf a phase adjustment \\\\( g(\\\\psi) = e^{-iKx}\\\\psi \\\\) is applied at some time t_1 as an intervention, will the final wave function \\\\( \\\\psi(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the Hamiltonian \\\\( H \\\\) and not on the actions of \\\\( K \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(\\\\psi) \\\\) at time t_1 modifies the wave function's phase again, potentially cancelling or reinforcing effects from the initial function \\\\( f(\\\\psi) \\\\). This interaction makes \\\\( \\\\psi(x, T) \\\\) dependent on both the initial phase modification by \\\\( K \\\\) and the intervention, alongside the inherently governing dynamics of \\\\( H \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
