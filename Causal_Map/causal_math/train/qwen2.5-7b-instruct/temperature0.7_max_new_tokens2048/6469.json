  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) representing a time-varying signal, and its Fourier Transform (FT) as \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\). We investigate the impact of two operations: multiplication by a real exponential \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\) and differentiation with respect to time \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\).\n\nIf the signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed into \\\\( z'(t) = e^{-at}z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and then the Fourier Transform is applied to \\\\( z'(t) \\\\), will the result be the same as directly applying the FT to the original signal without modification?",
  "Explanation": "Modifying the signal by multiplying with \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\) fundamentally changes its spectrum. The Fourier Transform of \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) is shifted in the frequency domain compared to the original (multiplication by \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\) corresponds to a frequency domain translation), resulting in a different frequency spectrum.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation of z(t) by multiplying with e^{-at} results in z'(t), which when Fourier transformed yields F'(ω), whereas the Fourier transform of the original z(t) is F(ω)."
