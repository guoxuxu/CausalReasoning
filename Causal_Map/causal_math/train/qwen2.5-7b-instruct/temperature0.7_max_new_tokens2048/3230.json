  "Problem": "Consider the effect of a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) on the function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) over the domain [0,1], where \\\\( L \\\\) is defined by the integral transformation \\\\( Lf(x) = \\\\int_0^1 K(x, s) f(s) ds \\\\) and \\\\( K(x, s) \\\\) is a kernel function representing a complex interaction.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( Lf(x) \\\\) for \\\\( f(x) = x^2 \\\\), can we confirm that \\\\( f(x) = x^2 \\\\) was the function operated upon without prior knowledge of whether another function g(x) was used instead?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of potential pre-application of a different function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) before applying \\\\( L \\\\), it's impossible to definitively conclude that the given output was solely from \\\\( f(x) = x^2 \\\\). The integral transformation includes integration against a kernel, which can obscure the original form of any pre-transform function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Lf(x) → f(x); K(x, s) → Lf(x); f(x) = x^2 → Lf(x); f(x) ≠ x^2 → Lf(x)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function f(x) directly influences Lf(x) through the integral transformation defined by K(x, s). Different functions f(x) can produce different Lf(x), but without additional information about K(x, s) or other potential functions, it's not possible to uniquely determine f(x) from Lf(x) alone."
