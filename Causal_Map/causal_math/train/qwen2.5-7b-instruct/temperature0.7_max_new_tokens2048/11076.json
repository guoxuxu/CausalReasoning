  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} z_0 \\\\) where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant angular frequency. We explore the effects of the Laplace transform defined by \\\\( L(z)(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the final observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can it be conclusively determined what interventions (either Laplace, Fourier, or both) were used, solely based on the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the overlapping influences of the Laplace and Fourier transforms on the trajectory and states of the system, multiple combinations of these transformations could yield the same final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\). This overlap creates ambiguity, preventing precise determination of the interventions used based on the final state alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
