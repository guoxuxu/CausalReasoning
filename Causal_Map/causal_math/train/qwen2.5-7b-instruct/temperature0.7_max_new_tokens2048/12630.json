  "Problem": "Consider the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax \\\\) governing a system, where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix. A Fourier transform \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}x(t) dt \\\\) is applied to transform the function over time.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) an operation is applied, modifying \\\\( x \\\\) to \\\\( Bx \\\\) (where \\\\( B \\\\) is another constant matrix), and then Fourier transformation is applied, would \\\\( F(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on \\\\( A \\\\) and not affected by \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( B \\\\) alters the state \\\\( x \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), and consequently the subsequent trajectory is influenced by \\\\( B \\\\) as well as \\\\( A \\\\). Thus, \\\\( F(T) \\\\) will depend on both \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\), reflecting changes due to the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Fourier transform F(s) of x(t) depends on the initial conditions and the dynamics described by A. Applying B at t1 modifies x(t) but does not directly affect the Fourier transform F(T) for T > t1, as F(s) is determined by the initial state and the evolution governed by A."
