  "Problem": "Analyze a mechanical system undergoing forced vibration governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + 2\\\\zeta\\\\omega\\\\dot{x} + \\\\omega^2 x = F(t)\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\zeta\\\\) is the damping ratio, \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the natural frequency, and \\\\(F(t) = A \\\\sin(\\\\omega t)\\\\) represents external periodic forcing. We explore the consequences of applying a transformation through convolution with an impulse response function \\\\(h(t) = e^{-\\\\zeta\\\\omega t}\\\\).\n\nIf a new impulse response function \\\\(g(t) = e^{-2\\\\zeta\\\\omega t}\\\\) is applied at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\) as an intervention, will the final response \\\\(x(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 solely depend on the original system parameters and not the applied functions \\\\(h(t)\\\\) or \\\\(g(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional convolution with \\\\(g(t)\\\\) at \\\\(t_1\\\\) introduces a further modification to the input affecting the system's inherent characteristics. This change in input properties due to both convolutions affects the overall system response, making the endpoint \\\\(x(T)\\\\) dependent on the properties of both \\\\(h(t)\\\\) and \\\\(g(t)\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The external forcing F(t) and the impulse responses h(t) and g(t) all cause changes in the system's response x(t). Applying g(t) at time t1 will influence x(t) for t > t1, but the final response x(T) for T > t1 depends on the initial system parameters and the overall input history, including F(t), h(t), and g(t)."
