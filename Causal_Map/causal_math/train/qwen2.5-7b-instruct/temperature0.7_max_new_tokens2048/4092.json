  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = Ce^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(C\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) are constants. We explore the effect of applying a linear transformation \\\\(T(z) = Az + B\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\) are complex constants.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations were used (whether \\\\(T(z)\\\\), \\\\(U(z)\\\\), or both) solely by knowing the outcome \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the possible combinations and effects of \\\\(A\\\\), \\\\(B\\\\), \\\\(D\\\\), and \\\\(E\\\\) in transforming the initial conditions and evolving the system state, multiple transformation sequences could result in the same endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\). These transformations and their non-trivial interplays yield ambiguities in backward determining them based on the final state.",
