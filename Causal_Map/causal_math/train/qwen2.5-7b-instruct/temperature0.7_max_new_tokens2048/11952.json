  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( g(z) \\) defined on the complex plane as \\( g(z) = e^{cz} \\) where \\( c \\) is a constant complex number. The function is studied under the Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{g(t)\\}(s) \\) which transforms \\( g(t) \\) from the time domain to the complex \\( s \\)-domain.\n\nIf \\( g(t) \\) is transformed using the Laplace Transform without any modifications, will the resulting function \\( G(s) \\) in the \\( s \\)-domain solely depend on the parameter \\( c \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform of \\( g(t) = e^{ct} \\) results in \\( G(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-c} \\), which directly depends on the parameter \\( c \\). The transformation properties ensure that the outcome in the \\( s \\)-domain is uniquely determined by \\( c \\) without requiring any additional intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
