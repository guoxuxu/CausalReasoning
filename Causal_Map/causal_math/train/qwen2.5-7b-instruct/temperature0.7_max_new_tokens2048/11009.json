  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. We study the effect of this transformation on the integral paths in the complex plane, specifically focusing on the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C e^{az} dz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) represents a path in the complex plane.\n\nIf a deformation \\\\( D \\\\) of path \\\\( C \\\\) in the complex plane is applied, leading to a new path \\\\( C' \\\\), will the integral value \\\\( \\\\int_{C'} e^{az} dz \\\\) remain unchanged from the original \\\\( \\\\int_C e^{az} dz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The value of the integral depends explicitly on the path in the complex plane due to the nature of the complex exponential function and its dependency on the path's start and end points. A deformation can change these bounds, thereby potentially altering the value of the integral.",
