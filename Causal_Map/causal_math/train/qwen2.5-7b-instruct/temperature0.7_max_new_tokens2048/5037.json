  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation scenario governed by the equation \\\\( z = Cw \\\\) in the complex domain, where C is a complex matrix. Additionally, we have an integral transform of z, defined as \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number.\n\nGiven an initial complex vector \\\\( w_0 \\\\) and applying \\\\( z = Cw_0 \\\\) followed by the transform \\\\( T(z) \\\\), will the transformed output \\\\( T(Cw_0) \\\\) be equivalent to directly applying the integral transform to \\\\( w_0 \\\\) without using matrix C?",
  "Explanation": "The matrix C modifies the vector \\\\( w_0 \\\\) before the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is applied, possibly altering both magnitude and direction in the complex plane. This typically results in a different transformed output as compared to directly transforming \\\\( w_0 \\\\). The properties and composition of matrix C are crucial in determining the final output of \\\\( T(Cw_0) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the linear transformation with matrix C on the initial complex vector w_0 results in z, which when subjected to the integral transform T produces the same output as directly applying the integral transform to w_0."
