  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Cx + Du \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) are constant matrices, and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a control input. The system's behavior is modified by applying a transformation \\\\( h(x) = e^{Ft}x \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( F \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( k(x) = e^{Gt}x \\\\) (where \\\\( G \\\\) is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) and not on \\\\( F \\\\) or \\\\( G \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( k(x) \\\\) adds an additional layer of complexity, making the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) dependent on \\\\( F \\\\), \\\\( G \\\\), as well as \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\). The transformations \\\\( e^{Ft} \\\\) before \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Gt} \\\\) after \\\\( t_1 \\\\) can significantly affect the system's dynamics and thus the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\).",
