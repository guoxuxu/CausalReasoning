  "Problem": "Analyze a physical system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + c \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0\\\\), where c is a constant. Investigate the effect of an integral transformation given by \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int e^{-sx}u(x,t)dx \\\\) applied at t = 0.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention is applied via a new transformation \\\\( G(u) = \\\\int e^{kx}u(x,t)dx \\\\) (where k is a constant), will the endpoint \\\\( T(u)(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be solely dependent on the initial PDE and not on the subsequent transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( G(u) \\\\), being another Laplace-like transform but with an opposite shift, will interact with the initial transformation \\\\( T(u) \\\\) and PDE evolution. Therefore, the endpoint \\\\( T(u)(T) \\\\) will reflect effects from both the PDE and all transformations (T and G), modifying the trajectory and the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "c → u; t → u; s → T(u); k → G(u); T → T(u); t_1 → G(u); t_1 → T(u); T(u) → T(u)(T); G(u) → T(u)(T)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of T(u)(T) at time T depends on the initial condition u(x,0) through the transformation T(u), and is influenced by subsequent transformations G(u) if they are applied after t_1."
