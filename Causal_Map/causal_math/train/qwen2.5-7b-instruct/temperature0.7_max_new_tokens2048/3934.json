  "Problem": "Consider a fluid mechanic system where the velocity field \\\\( \\\\vec{v}(x, t) \\\\) is governed by the Navier-Stokes equation \\\\( \\\\partial_t \\\\vec{v} + (\\\\vec{v} \\\\cdot \\\\nabla)\\\\vec{v} = -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho} \\\\nabla p + \\\\nu \\\\nabla^2 \\\\vec{v} \\\\). We introduce a scalar field temperature \\\\( T(x,t) \\\\) affected by both convection and diffusion, described by the advection-diffusion equation \\\\( \\\\partial_t T + \\\\vec{v} \\\\cdot \\\\nabla T = \\\\kappa \\\\nabla^2 T \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the diffusion coefficient.\n\nObserving the changes in temperature distribution \\\\( T(x, T) \\\\) at time T, can we infer the specific modifications in the velocity field \\\\( \\\\vec{v}(x, t) \\\\) at earlier times without any additional data?",
  "Explanation": "Temperature distribution alone cannot uniquely determine the underlying changes in velocity, as the same temperature changes could be caused by multiple, different velocity distributions due to the convolution of diffusive and advective effects.",
