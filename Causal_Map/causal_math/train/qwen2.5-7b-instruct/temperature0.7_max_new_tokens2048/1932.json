  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by a complex integral \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{i\\\\omega s} ds \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the square root of -1 and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We analyze the transformation under a subsequent function \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\).\n\nCan we identify the exact moment of intervention (change in \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)) and the nature of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), based solely on knowledge of the result \\\\( h(z(T)) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The squared result and modification in \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) interact in a complex manner affecting both magnitude and phase of \\\\( z(T) \\\\). It is challenging to deduce the precise intervention time or alterations distinctly, as multiple configurations could yield the same end result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
