  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a time-varying two-dimensional system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where \\\\(M\\\\) is a constant 2x2 matrix. We explore the consequence of intervention through a transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{Nt}z\\\\), where \\\\(N\\\\) is another constant 2x2 matrix.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can it be precisely determined which transformations (either \\\\(h(z)\\\\), \\\\(k(z)\\\\), both, or none) were applied based only on \\\\(z(T)\\\\) information?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple trajectories could lead to the same final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\), especially in the presence of non-commutative matrix exponentials such as those from \\\\(N\\\\) and \\\\(L\\\\). The end state could equally result from various combinations or sequences of transformations, or none at all, making it impossible to definitively ascertain which transformations were applied based solely on the endpoint.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
