  "Problem": "Consider a system represented by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = ax - by \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\frac{dy}{dt} = bx + ay \\\\), where a and b are constants. We assess the system's behavior under the influence of a Laplace transform applied to both components x(t) and y(t).\n\nCan the original states \\\\( x(0) \\\\) and \\\\( y(0) \\\\) be unambiguously determined after observing the trajectory at time t = T without knowing whether a Laplace transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without certainty about the application of the Laplace transform, it is mathematically impossible to revert to the precise original states. The transformation could have altered the frequency and phase components in a way that is not recoverable just by observing the state at a later time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
