  "Problem": "In the examination of a physical system governed by the wave equation \\\\(u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx}\\\\), where c is the wave speed, consider the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t)\\\\) applied to u(x, t) and its properties across time and space.\n\nGiven the endpoint wave profile \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( g(u) \\\\), another transformation, or none), only by knowing the value of \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The complexity introduced by potential interventions (like spatial phase shifts or amplitude modifications) and their effects on the wave profile make it infeasible to precisely identify what interventions were used just from the final wave profile. The wave equation's linearity and superposition properties allow for multiple interventions producing similar or indistinguishable outcomes at t = T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
