  "Problem": "Let's consider a continuous system characterized by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = -\\\\lambda u\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\lambda > 0\\\\) specifies the system's response behavior. We investigate the effect of applying the Laplace transform on this system, with the Laplace transform defined as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}[u(t)](s) = U(s)\\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed solution \\\\(U(s, x)\\\\) in the Laplace domain after an intervention at \\\\(t = t_0\\\\), can we ascertain exactly what kind of perturbation was introduced to the system, assuming the only knowledge we have is the nature of the original unmodified system and \\\\(U(s, x)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the specific perturbation from the transformed solution alone is intricate since the perturbation's effect could be mathematically entangled with effects arising from the system's dynamics characterized by \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\). The information about the exact scalar \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) or functional form of the perturbation cannot be uniquely extracted without additional data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of λ influences the function u, the time point t_0 influences the transformed function U(s, x), and the function u(t) is transformed into U(s) via the Laplace transform."
