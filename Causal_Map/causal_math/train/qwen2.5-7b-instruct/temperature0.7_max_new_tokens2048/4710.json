  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) described by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a constant matrix. We explore the effect of transforming \\\\( z(t) \\\\) using the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\), where \\\\( Q \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) could have been influenced by the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) without this knowledge, differentiating the initial conditions isn't feasible. Especially if \\\\( Q \\\\) and \\\\( P \\\\) have non-commuting properties, tracing back the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) accurately becomes impossible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of z with respect to time is determined by P; the transformation h(z) is defined by Q and applied to z at time t; observing z at time T allows us to infer the initial state z_0 if h(z) was not applied."
