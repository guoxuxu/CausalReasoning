  "Problem": "Analyze the effects of a Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) \\\\) applied to a continuous function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), especially focusing on integrating this transform into a control system represented by a differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t)\\\\) where A and B are constant matrices and \\\\(u(t)\\\\) is a control input function.\n\nIf an additional transformation is applied to the control input post-Laplace Transform (say, a second transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{G}(u)(s) \\\\)), will the resulting system state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) follow a trajectory determined only by the original system design (matrices A and B), independent of the transformation applied?",
  "Explanation": "Any further transformation applied to the control input, like \\\\( \\\\mathcal{G}(u)(s) \\\\), adds another layer of modification, potentially altering the dynamics, timing, and nature of the control actions applied to the system, thus affecting the system's trajectory and not solely being a function of the original matrices A and B.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input function f(t) is transformed by the Laplace transform to F(s), which influences the system state X(s) through the differential equation X(s) = AX(s) + BU(s). The control input u(t) is further transformed by G(u) to U(s), which also affects X(s). The system state x(t) is thus influenced by both the original system design (matrices A and B) and the transformations applied to f(t) and u(t)."
