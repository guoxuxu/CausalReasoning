  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f: \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\) defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) and its integration along a path in the complex plane. Analyze the influence of deforming the integration path from \\\\( z = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( z = 1 + i \\\\) using two different paths, a straight line (path A) and a semicircle in the upper half-plane centered at \\\\( z = 0.5 + 0.5i \\\\) with radius 0.5 (path B).\n\nCan the intervention type (alteration to \\\\( g(z) = z e^{z} \\\\)) be exactly determined from the end integral value over either path?",
  "Explanation": "Given the end value of an integral, particularly with function changes in a complex domain, it is virtually impossible to backtrack and uniquely ascertain that the specific modification \\\\( g(z) = z e^{z} \\\\) was made, especially without detailed information on how the path might've interacted with the altered function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The type of path (either a straight line or a semicircle) influences the integral value of f(z) = e^z over that path; altering g(z) = z * e^z does not directly determine the exact intervention type from the end integral value over either path."
