  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the partial differential equation ∂u/∂t = Lu where L is a linear differential operator. We examine the impact of the Fourier transform on the solution, specifically, the operation defined by the function g(u) = F(u), where F denotes the Fourier transform.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( u(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( F(u) \\\\), \\\\( F^{-1}(u) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( u(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) could be the result of various combinations of applying and then removing the Fourier transform, each potentially yielding the same endpoint under the dynamics governed by L. The non-unique pathway to achieve the same transformed or back-transformed state militates against definitive identification of interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
