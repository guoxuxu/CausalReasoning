  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function system where a function \\( z(t) = e^{it}u \\) for complex \\( u \\) is undergoing transformation with \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = Cz \\), where C is a complex number. The impact of an operation defined as \\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\) wherein D is a distinct complex constant is considered.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\( z(T) \\), can we determine precisely what operations were used (whether \\( g(z) \\), \\( h(z) \\), or both), just by knowing the value of \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple variations in operations and parameters (C, D, E) can yield the same endpoint \\( z(T) \\) due to the properties of exponential functions in the complex domain. This ambiguity in possible state trajectories and overlapping effects from different exponential transformations makes it impossible to identify the operations uniquely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
