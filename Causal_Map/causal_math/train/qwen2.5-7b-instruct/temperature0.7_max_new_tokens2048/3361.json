  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. We examine the impact of applying a linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = cz + d \\\\) where \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\) are complex constants, on the function \\\\( f \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at \\\\( z = 0 \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( f(z) \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at \\\\( z = Z \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to \\\\( z = Z \\\\) under \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( T(z) \\\\) alters the input of the function, leading to \\\\( f(T(z_0)) = e^{a(cz_0 + d)} \\\\), which is distinct from \\\\( f(z_0) = e^{az_0} \\\\) due to the additional multiplication and shift by \\\\( d \\\\). This changes the function's output for any non-zero \\\\( d \\\\) and scaling factor \\\\( c \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the linear transformation T(z0) results in z, which is then input into f(z), causing f(z) to transform accordingly. Directly evolving z0 under f(z) to reach z = Z will yield the same result as applying T(z0) and then f(z), given that the transformation T(z0) maps z0 to z before f(z) acts on it."
