  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant. Let's analyze the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\(T[f(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt\\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex number with positive real part.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) to \\\\(\\\\omega'\\\\) at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), causing a new function \\\\(z'(t) = e^{i\\\\omega' t}\\\\), will the resulting transformed function \\\\(T[z'(t)]\\\\) be solely determined by \\\\(\\\\omega'\\\\) and independent of the original \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new function \\\\(z'(t)\\\\) after the intervention distinctly depends on \\\\(\\\\omega'\\\\), and upon applying the transformation \\\\(T\\\\), the outcome \\\\(\\\\frac{1}{s-i\\\\omega'}\\\\) reflects only the new frequency \\\\(\\\\omega'\\\\). Therefore, the outcome is independent of the original frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in \\(\\omega\\) to \\(\\omega'\\) changes the function \\(z(t)\\) to \\(z'(t)\\), which then leads to a change in the transformed function \\(T[z'(t)]\\) from \\(T[z(t)]\\)."
