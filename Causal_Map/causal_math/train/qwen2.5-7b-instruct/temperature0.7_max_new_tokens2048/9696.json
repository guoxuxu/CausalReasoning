  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency and \\\\( i \\\\) denotes the imaginary unit. The scenario evaluates the impact of modifying this function through an integral transform, specifically a Laplace transform, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\) valid for \\\\( \\\\Re(s) > 0 \\\\).\n\nGiven the resulting Laplace transform after an intervention, can we ascertain whether the frequency was modified before or after the Laplace transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "If the frequency modification occurred before the Laplace transform, the pole in the transformed function will indicate the modified frequency; otherwise, the pole would indicate the original frequency. Thus, the position of the pole in the Laplace space clearly tells us the timing of the intervention relative to the transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The frequency ω directly influences the form of z(t), and applying the Laplace transform to z(t) results in a new function \\(\\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega}\\) that reflects the original frequency ω."
