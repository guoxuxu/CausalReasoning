  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant frequency. We investigate the dynamics of this function under the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-ist}z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nCan we determine the frequency \\\\( w \\\\) of the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) precisely by only knowing the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) is concentrated at \\\\( s = w \\\\), manifested as a Dirac delta function \\\\( \\\\delta(s-w) \\\\). This specific feature allows for the precise determination of frequency \\\\( w \\\\) from the Fourier transform.",
