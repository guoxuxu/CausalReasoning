  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = e^{iwx} \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a constant, and its interaction with the Laplace transform, which we denote as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(x)\\\\}(s) = F(s) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( z(x) \\\\) to \\\\( z(x) + v \\\\) where \\\\( v \\\\) is a vector in a complex plane prior to the Laplace transform, will the outcome \\\\( F(s) \\\\) solely depend on the parameter \\\\( w \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of \\\\( v \\\\) changes the function structure introduced to the Laplace transform, thus \\\\( F(s) \\\\) depends not only on \\\\( w \\\\) but also the nature and components of \\\\( v \\\\). This intervention alters the Laplace output substantially by changing initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
