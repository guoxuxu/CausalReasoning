  "Problem": "Consider a control system in which an input vector \\\\( u(t) \\\\) influences the output \\\\( x(t) \\\\) via the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We investigate the change induced by a transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(x) = Ce^{Dt}x \\\\) where C and D are also constant matrices.\n\nIf \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied to the state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\\\) without any further intervention, will the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) alters the initial state in a manner affected by C and D. This change can significantly alter the dynamics governed by A and B, resulting in a different trajectory and ending state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input vector u(t) and initial state x(0) directly influence the state x(t) through the dynamics defined by A and B. The transformation h(x) defined by C and D modifies the initial state x(0) but does not affect the subsequent evolution of x(t) under the dynamics defined by A and B. Therefore, the state x(T) after applying h(x(0)) and evolving under A and B for time T is not necessarily the same as evolving x(0) directly under A and B for time T."
