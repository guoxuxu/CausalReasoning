  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator. We investigate the effect of applying a Fourier transformation \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t))\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) represents the Fourier space variable, on the system's behavior over time.\n\nGiven the transformed endpoint \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions (specifically the filter \\\\(\\\\hat{g}(k)\\\\)) were used, merely by analyzing \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the specific intervention such as \\\\(\\\\hat{g}(k)\\\\) from the final state \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) is non-trivial without additional information. The modifications induced by \\\\(\\\\hat{g}(k)\\\\) could be confounded with effects due to the natural evolution under \\\\(L\\\\). Multiple filter functions could produce similar effects in Fourier space, leading to ambiguity in identifying the exact nature of the interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
