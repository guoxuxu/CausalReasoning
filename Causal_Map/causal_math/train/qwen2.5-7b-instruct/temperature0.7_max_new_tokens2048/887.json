  "Problem": "Consider a continuous linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(dx/dt = Mx\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We examine the effect of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(x) = S(t)x \\\\) over time t, where S(t) is a transformation that represents shuffling components of x based on another constant matrix S.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(x) = Q(t)x \\\\) (where Q is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on M and not on S or Q?",
  "Explanation": "The intervening application of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) introduces additional modifications that could rearrange or transform the vector x, impacting how the system evolves under M thereafter. Thus, the final state at time T will depend on M, S, and Q, as each has potentially altered the dynamics or basis of the state vector in a significant way.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
