  "Problem": "Consider a controlled dynamical system where the input-output relationship is governed by a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{tA}x(t) \\), with \\( x(t) \\) representing the system state at time \\( t \\) and \\( A \\) a complex constant matrix. We analyze the effect of transforming the system state via a function \\( g(x) = D x \\), where \\( D \\) is a diagonal matrix.\n\nIf \\( g(x) \\) is applied as an initial condition so \\( x(0) \\) is transformed to \\( g(x(0)) \\), and then the system evolves according to \\( z(t) = e^{tA}x(t) \\) without further intervention, will \\( z(T) \\) at \\( T \\) be the same as if \\( x(0) \\) was directly used as the initial condition under \\( z(t) = e^{tA}x(t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( g(x) = Dx \\) changes the initial conditions from \\( x(0) \\) to \\( Dx(0) \\). The propagation \\( e^{tA} \\) affects the transformed and original states differently unless \\( D \\) commutes with \\( e^{tA} \\), leading to different outputs at time \\( T \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation g to the initial state x(0) results in a different initial state, which then evolves differently over time according to the system dynamics, leading to a different z(T) compared to using x(0) directly."
