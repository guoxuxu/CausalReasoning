  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by a complex function \\\\( z(t) =  x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions describing a signal's components in time. A Fourier transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) is applied to transform \\\\( z(t) \\\\) into the frequency domain.\n\nIf an additional filtering process \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) in the frequency domain before performing an inverse Fourier transform, will the resulting function perfectly represent the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by the filter \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\) alters the original characteristics of \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\), hence the time-domain function obtained post-inverse transform will reflect these changes, failing to be a perfect reconstruction of the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying a filtering process G(ω) to F(ω) results in F'(ω), which when inverse Fourier transformed gives z'(t). The original function z(t) Fourier transforms into F(ω)."
