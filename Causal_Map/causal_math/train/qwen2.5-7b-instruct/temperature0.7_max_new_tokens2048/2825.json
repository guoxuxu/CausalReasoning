  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\) where both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) solve the ordinary differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}u = -Au \\\\) with A being a positive constant, and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. We explore the scenario where a complex transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) is applied, with B a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}u = -Au \\\\) for both real and imaginary parts without further intervention, will the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}u = -Au \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) alters the initial complex number through a transformation dependent on B and t. Hence both the magnitude and phase of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolve differently from simply applying \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}u = -Au \\\\) directly to \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial values x(0) and y(0) directly cause x(T) and y(T) respectively, which together determine z(T). Applying the transformation e^(Bt) to z_0 at t=0 and evolving it under \\(\\frac{d}{dt}u = -Au\\) leads to z(t), which at time T is equivalent to directly evolving z_0 to time T under the same differential equation."
