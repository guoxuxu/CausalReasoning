  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the output \\( y(t) \\) is governed by the linear time-invariant differential equation \\( \\dot{y} = My + Nu \\), with \\( M \\) and \\( N \\) as constant matrices and \\( u(t) \\) as the control input. An operator \\( T(y) = e^{Ky} \\) is introduced, where \\( K \\) is a constant matrix.\n\nIf we observe \\( y(t) \\) at time T, can we deduce the original vector \\( y_0 \\) at t = 0 without knowing whether \\( T(y) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\( T(y) \\), distinguishing between the original and transformed initial conditions is challenging due to the non-reversible nature of the exponential transformation unless specific constraints on \\( K \\) and \\( M \\) are known, which typically is not the case.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
