  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. The impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\omega s}z(s) ds \\\\) is analyzed over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to the function starting at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under its own dynamics without further intervention, will the functional form of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) accumulates the effects of the exponential function over time, altering the path of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) due to the integral, thus leading to a different outcome at time T compared to an unmodified evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
