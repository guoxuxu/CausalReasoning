  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a constant voltage source V and a linear resistor R in series with a capacitor C. The charge Q on the capacitor is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dQ}{dt} = \\\\frac{V - Q/C}{R}\\\\). We study the impact of applying a sinusoidal function \\\\(f(t) = A \\\\sin(\\\\omega t)\\\\) as an external forcing term to the circuit.\n\nIf the function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) is applied to the circuit at t = 0 and the system is allowed to evolve without further intervention, will \\\\(Q(t)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if no external forcing term was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the external forcing term \\\\(f(t) = A \\\\sin(\\\\omega t)\\\\) modifies the differential equation governing the charge Q. This results in a different solution for Q(t), potentially causing oscillatory behavior that would not occur without the forcing term.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying a sinusoidal external forcing term f(t) to the circuit changes the voltage V, which in turn affects the charge Q on the capacitor, leading to a different Q(t) at time T compared to when no external forcing term is applied."
