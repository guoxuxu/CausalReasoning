  "Problem": "Analyze the system governed by the complex differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz\\\\) where i is the imaginary unit. Consider the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\) over time t, with k being a constant complex number.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another function \\\\( h(z) = e^{mt}z \\\\) (where m is a constant complex number) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the dynamics defined by i, and not on k or m?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces a new modifying variable, m, influencing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) along with k and i. The overall trajectory becomes governed by both interventions and the underlying dynamics, resulting in \\\\( z(T) = z_0e^{it}e^{k(t_1)}e^{m(T-t_1)} \\\\), hence dependent on k, m, and i.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The endpoint z(T) depends directly on the dynamics defined by i through the transformation g(z) = e^(kt)z, and indirectly through h(z) = e^(mt)z. However, after applying h(z) at t_1, the endpoint z(T) for T > t_1 will depend on both k and m."
