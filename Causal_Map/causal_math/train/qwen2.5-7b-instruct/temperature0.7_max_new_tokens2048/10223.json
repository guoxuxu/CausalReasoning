  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t, governed by the equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\), with A and B being constant matrices. We analyze the impact of the transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on A and B and not on C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces another layer of complexity. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on the initial transform \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\), the system's inherent properties (A and B), and the intervention \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\). This combinative effect means that all matrices contribute to the trajectory and final state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "A and B directly cause x(t) and y(t) respectively; x(t) and y(t) together determine z(t); C and D do not directly cause z(t) after t_1, thus z(T) depends only on A and B for T > t_1."
