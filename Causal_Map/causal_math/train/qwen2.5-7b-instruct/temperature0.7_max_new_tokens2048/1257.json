  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a Laplace transform of the function \\\\( g(t) = e^{At} \\\\), where A is a complex constant, in the context of an integral transformation. We are particularly interested in the causality analysis between transformations and original functions.\n\nDoes applying the Laplace transform to \\\\( g(t) \\\\) without any intervention preserve the original dependency characteristics of the function on A in the transformed domain?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Laplace transform of \\\\( g(t) = e^{At} \\\\) is \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-A} \\\\) when Re(s) > Re(A), the dependency on A is explicitly preserved in the transformed domain without alteration. The transformative nature of the Laplace calculation directly carries over A's effects into the s-domain representation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
