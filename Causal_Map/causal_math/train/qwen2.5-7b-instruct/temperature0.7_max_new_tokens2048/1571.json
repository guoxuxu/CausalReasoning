  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) and its impact under a Fourier transformation, specifically looking at \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{f(z)\\\\}(k) \\\\). The parameter \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf a transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied to \\\\( f(z) \\\\) before taking its Fourier transform, is the output primarily influenced by the new transformation and not just by \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) modifies \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) to \\\\( e^{az^2} \\\\), significantly altering its behavior. The Fourier transform of this new function, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{e^{az^2}\\\\}(k) \\\\), substantially depends on this quadratic transformation, showcasing effects like broadening that are distinct from those caused by \\\\( a \\\\) alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
