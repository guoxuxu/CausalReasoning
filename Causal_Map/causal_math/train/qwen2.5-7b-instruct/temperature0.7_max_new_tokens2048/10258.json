  "Problem": "Evaluate the influence of a complex transformation defined by \\\\( z(w) = e^w \\\\) on the stability of solutions to a differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dw}{dt} = kw \\\\), where k is a complex constant.\n\nCan the original complex number \\\\( w_0 \\\\) be uniquely determined from the final state \\\\( z(w(T)) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( z \\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the transformation \\\\( z(w) = e^w \\\\) is uniquely invertible to \\\\( w = \\log(z) \\\\), and the evolution under the given differential equation is deterministically reversible by solving it backward, \\\\( w(T) \\\\) can be traced back uniquely to \\\\( w_0 \\\\). With knowledge of \\\\( z(w(T)) \\\\), \\\\( w_0 \\\\) can be determined regardless of when \\\\( z \\\\) was applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial complex number w influences both the transformed value z and the rate of change dw/dt. The complex constant k determines the rate of change dw/dt. The final state z(w(T)) does not uniquely determine the original complex number w_0 without additional information."
