  "Problem": "Consider the heat equation in one dimension described by \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) is the temperature distribution and \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. We analyze the effect of applying a transformation defined by \\\\( f(u) = e^{\\\\lambda t}u \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(u) \\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) and this modified state is then evolved by the heat equation without further intervention, will \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) be the same as if the original \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) was evolved directly under the heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(u) \\\\) alters the initial temperature distribution by multiplying it by \\\\( e^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\), which changes dynamically with time. This initial modification changes the evolution of the system under the heat equation, resulting in a different temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial temperature distribution u(x,0) evolves over time t under the influence of thermal diffusivity k to become u(x,t). Applying the transformation f(u) = e^(λt)u to u(x,0) before evolving it with the heat equation results in a different temperature distribution u(x,t) compared to evolving the original u(x,0) directly. The time T affects the final state u(x,T) of the temperature distribution."
