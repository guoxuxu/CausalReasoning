  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution in a rod over time t is modeled by the heat equation \\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\), where k is the thermal diffusivity constant. We analyze the impact of applying a time-dependent heat source \\( S(x,t) = h(t) \\cdot \\cos(\\omega x) \\) along the rod.\n\nGiven the temperature distribution \\( u(x,T) \\) at t = 10, can we deduce whether the heat source \\( S(x,t) \\) was applied at t = 0 without knowing the form of \\( h(t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without the explicit form of the time-dependent function \\( h(t) \\) and its influence, the changes in \\( u(x,T) \\) could be due to variations in boundary conditions or other sources not accounted for. The ambiguity in the heat source details prevents the reversal of the cause from the observed effect.",
