  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = \\\\Delta u \\\\), where \\\\( u(t,x) \\\\) is the temperature distribution over a domain. We investigate the effect of introducing a source term \\\\( S(x) \\\\) applied from time t = 0, described mathematically as \\\\( u_t = \\\\Delta u + S(x) \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), a modification of the boundary condition or an additional source term \\\\( S_2(x) \\\\) is introduced, will the temperature distribution \\\\( u(T,x) \\\\) be only dependent on the original source term \\\\( S(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing a new source term \\\\( S_2(x) \\\\) or altering the boundary conditions at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) can significantly influence the system dynamics and the resulting temperature distribution. The effects of \\\\( S(x) \\\\) and \\\\( S_2(x) \\\\) and any change in boundary condition accumulate, influence diffusion, and affect the final state \\\\( u(T,x) \\\\), making it dependent on more than just the original source term.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
