  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the function \\( z = f(x, y) \\) where \\( f(x, y) = x^2 + iy^2 \\), and \\( x, y \\) are real variables. Here, we further explore the effect of the integral transformation defined by \\( T[f](\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x, y) e^{-i\\omega x} dx \\) on this system.\n\nIf \\( T[f](\\omega) \\) is computed initially for some \\(\\omega\\), then no further transformations are applied, and only the underlying function \\( f \\) evolves by adjusting \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), will \\( T[f](\\omega) \\) at a later time reflect the changes in \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) linearly through \\( \\omega \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( T[f](\\omega) \\) captures the frequency component of \\( f \\) with respect to \\( x \\) and not \\( y \\). Any changes in \\( y \\) will lead to a change in the imaginary part of \\( f \\), especially since \\( y^2 \\) will contribute a biasing term, but will not linearly influence the outcome of \\( T[f](\\omega) \\), which is primarily sensitive to changes in \\( x \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
