  "Problem": "Consider a complex analysis problem where the function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) is transformed using an integral along a contour \\\\( C \\\\). The contour \\\\( C \\\\) is specified to be the unit circle in the complex plane. Assume that the variable transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied to modify the path of integration.\n\nCan we infer the original contour \\\\( C \\\\) after observing the integral value over the transformed path \\\\( h(z)(C) \\\\) without knowing \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\), deducing the original contour \\\\( C \\\\) solely based on the integral result is ambiguous. The transformed integral results could theoretically align with those from a different original contour or different function properties, especially in the absence of additional information on orientation and starting points.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the transformation h(z) directly causes the path of integration to change, which then influences the integral value; the original contour C directly determines the original contour of integration."
