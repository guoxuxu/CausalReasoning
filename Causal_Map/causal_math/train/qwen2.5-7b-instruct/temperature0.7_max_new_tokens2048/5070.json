  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We analyze the impact of the linear operator \\\\( L \\{z\\} = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z(t)dt \\\\), known as the Laplace transform, on this function over time.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( L\\{z\\}(s) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) of the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "From the transformed function \\\\( L\\{z\\}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\\\), we can uniquely solve for \\\\( \\omega \\\\) since it directly corresponds to the imaginary part of the pole of the Laplace transform. Hence, \\\\( \\omega \\\\) can be uniquely identified.",
