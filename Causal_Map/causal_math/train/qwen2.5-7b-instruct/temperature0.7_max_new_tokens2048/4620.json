  "Problem": "Consider a complex function Z, where Z(s) = integral from 0 to infinity of e^(-st) * cos(t) dt. We are exploring the impact of applying a Laplace transformation to this function and subsequent transformations defined by the operation G(Z) = 1/(s^2 + 1).\n\nGiven the evaluation of G(Z) at time T and knowing a transformation H(Z) = sZ was used at some point, can we deduce whether H was applied after or before G just by examining the end state G(Z)?",
  "Explanation": "Analyzing the outcome of G(Z) alone does not give enough information to identify the sequence of transformations (whether H was pre or post G). Since H fundamentally alters Z and G processes this modified Z, the final form will be the same regardless of the order of operations involving H and G in this context.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying G transforms Z through the operation 1/(s^2 + 1), while applying H multiplies Z by s. The order of applying G and H cannot be determined solely by examining the end state G(Z) because both transformations affect Z independently."
