  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where a continuous function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) describes a complex-valued signal, and the Laplace transform \\\\(Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s)\\\\) is used to analyze the system's frequency domain properties. The signal is transformed using a complex function \\\\(f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant angular frequency.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(f(z)\\\\) is applied to a signal \\\\(z_0(t)\\\\) at t = 0, and then the signal evolves over time without any further transformations, will the Laplace transform \\\\(Z(s)\\\\) of the modified signal at any later time t = T solely depend on \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and not the original characteristics of \\\\(z_0(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(f(z)\\\\) alters the signal by modulating it with a frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), but the underlying characteristics of \\\\(z_0(t)\\\\) such as its amplitude and phase information are still preserved and influence the resulting Laplace transform \\\\(Z(s)\\\\). Thus, both \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and the properties of \\\\(z_0(t)\\\\) determine \\\\(Z(s)\\\\).",
