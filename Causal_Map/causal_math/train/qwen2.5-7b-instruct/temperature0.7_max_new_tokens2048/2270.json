  "Problem": "Consider an electrical network consisting of resistors and capacitors governed by the equation \\\\(V(t) = U(C, R, t)\\\\) where V is the voltage, U is a function of capacitor values (C), resistance values (R) and time (t). Let a transformation be defined by \\\\(f(V) = Z^{-1}e^{At}V\\\\), where Z is the impedance matrix and A is a diagonal matrix representing frequency-dependent behavior.\n\nGiven the voltage \\\\(V(t)\\\\) at time t = T, and knowing the system's parameters (C, R), can one reliably infer the initial voltage \\\\(V_0\\\\) without knowing whether transformation \\\\(f(V)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the application of \\\\(f(V)\\\\) and its parameter matrix A, it's impossible to accurately backtrack the initial voltage due to the potential modification by \\\\(Z^{-1}e^{At}\\\\). The transformation introduces an ambiguity in deriving the original state solely from the final state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
