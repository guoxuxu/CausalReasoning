  "Problem": "In this scenario, we consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), where \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). This scenario investigates how the causal relationship between functions and their transforms behaves with or without interventions in the form of function modification.\n\nIf an exponential function \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) is multiplied to \\\\( g(t) = f(t) + c \\\\) during the Laplace transform, resulting in \\\\( H(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{e^{at}g(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), will \\\\( H(s) \\\\) only reflect the presence of \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) and not the addition of the constant \\\\( c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\) will be \\\\( H(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{e^{at}(f(t) + c)\\\\}(s) = F(s-a) + \\\\frac{c}{s-a} \\\\). This shows dependence on both the exponential modification and the initial constant addition, indicating combined effects, not isolating one.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
