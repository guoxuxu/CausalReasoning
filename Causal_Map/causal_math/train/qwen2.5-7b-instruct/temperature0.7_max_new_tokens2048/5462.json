  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system governed by the differential equation \\(\\\\dot{x} = Kx\\), where K is a constant matrix. Investigate the system's behavior under the transformation \\( g(x) = Q^{-1}x \\) over time t, where Q is a constant and invertible matrix.\n\nCan we determine the original vector \\( x_0 \\) at t = 0 after observing \\( x(t) \\) at t = T without knowing whether \\( g(x) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the transformation \\( g(x) \\) was applied, it is impossible to uniquely recover \\( x_0 \\) just from \\( x(t) \\) at t = T. The transformation \\( Q^{-1} \\) could have modified \\( x_0 \\) to a new state that evolves differently under \\( K \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "By observing x(t) at time t = T, we can determine x_0 at t = 0 if the transformation g(x) = Q^(-1)x is known, since x(t) = Q^(-1)x_0 * e^(Kt) and thus x_0 = Qx(t) * e^(-KT)."
