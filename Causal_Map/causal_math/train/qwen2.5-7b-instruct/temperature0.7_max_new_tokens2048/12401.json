  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a complex constant. We analyze the behavior of this system when subjected to a Fourier transform, defined as \\\\( \\mathcal{F}(z)(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-i \\xi t} z(t) \\, dt \\\\).\n\nIf only the Fourier transformed result \\\\( \\mathcal{F}(z)(\\xi) \\\\) is known to peak at \\\\( \\xi = \\omega \\\\), can we deduce that the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was \\\\( e^{i \\omega t} \\\\) before transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The peaking of \\\\( \\mathcal{F}(z)(\\xi) \\\\) at \\\\( \\omega \\\\) indicates that the original function had a frequency component of \\\\( \\omega \\\\). Due to the properties of the Fourier transform, it is the exclusive frequency of the original oscillating function.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The Fourier transformed result peaking at ξ=ω indicates that z(t) is e^(i ω t), and conversely, z(t) being e^(i ω t) results in the Fourier transformed result peaking at ξ=ω."
