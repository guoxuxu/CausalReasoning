  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z(t) = C e^{Dt}\\\\), where the matrix \\\\(D\\\\) governs the dynamics of \\\\(z\\\\), and \\\\(C\\\\) is a vector of initial conditions. The system undergoes a transformation via another function \\\\(h(z) = Mz\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\), where \\\\(M\\\\) is a transformation matrix.\n\nIf an additional function \\\\(g(z) = Nz\\\\) is applied at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), where \\\\(N\\\\) is another transformation matrix, will the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) depend solely on the matrix \\\\(D\\\\) and not on \\\\(M\\\\) or \\\\(N\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the transformation \\\\(g(z)\\\\) as an intervention changes the system state to \\\\(Nz(t_1)\\\\) at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), and this intervention mutates the trajectory such that the final state depends on \\\\(M\\\\), \\\\(N\\\\), and \\\\(D\\\\). The matrix exponentials and their sequence significantly influence the final state, making it dependent not only on \\\\(D\\\\) but also on the applied transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The final state z(T) depends on the matrix D through the dynamics of z(t), and is influenced by the initial condition C. It is also affected by the transformations h(z) and g(z) at specific times, but once T > t_1, only D continues to influence z(T)."
