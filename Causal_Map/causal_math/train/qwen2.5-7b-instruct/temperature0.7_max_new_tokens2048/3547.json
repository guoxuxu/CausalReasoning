  "Problem": "Let us consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t represents time. We analyze how this function transforms under the application of a differential operator \\\\( D = \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\) and also how it behaves when modified by a scheduled intervention described as multiplication by a complex constant \\\\( c \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention by a complex multiplication by \\\\( c \\\\) is applied at a time \\\\( t = t_1 \\\\), altering the function to become \\\\( cz(t_1) \\\\), will the function at T > t_1 depend solely on the original transformation under \\\\( D \\\\) and not on \\\\( c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) fundamentally modifies the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by transforming it to \\\\( cz(t_1) \\\\). Thus, the future values of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for t > t_1 depend not only on \\\\( D \\\\) but also on the scaling and rotation introduced by \\\\( c \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function z(t) evolves over time according to its derivative z'(t). At time t_1, multiplying z(t_1) by a complex constant c changes the function to cz(t_1). After t_1, the function z(T) for T > t_1 is influenced by the original differential transformation but not by the complex multiplication c."
