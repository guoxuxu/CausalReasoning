  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant, complex matrix, and \\\\( x \\\\) is a vector in \\\\( \\\\mathbb{C}^n \\\\). We analyze how the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{B\\\\tau}z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), with \\\\( B \\\\) also a constant matrix, changes the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is computed at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves by \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\) for \\\\( t > 0 \\\\) without further application of \\\\( f \\\\), will the state at \\\\( t = T \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( f \\\\) was never applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) is simply the zero vector (due to the integral of zero), the subsequent evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) remains unaltered. Therefore, it follows the prescribed exponential map \\\\( e^{At}x \\\\), resulting in the same state at any \\\\( t = T \\\\) as if the transformation was never applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state z(0) directly influences f(z), which in turn affects z(T). The evolution of z(t) depends on A, and applying f(z) modifies this evolution. Without further application of f(z) after t=0, the state at t=T will differ from the scenario where f(z) was never applied."
