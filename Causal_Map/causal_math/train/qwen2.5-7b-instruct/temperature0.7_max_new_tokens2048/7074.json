  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) acting on a function space, defined as \\\\( Lf = \\\\frac{d^2f}{dx^2} \\\\. The Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx} f(x) \\\\, dx \\\\) is used to analyze the system.\n\nCan we determine the exact function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) from its Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(k) \\\\) after \\\\( L \\\\) has been applied, without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( Lf \\\\) provides enough information to reconstruct \\\\( f(x) \\\\) accurately, as it translates the operation of \\\\( L \\\\) into the multiplication by \\\\( -k^2 \\\\), which is uniquely invertible in the space of functions typically considered in this setting.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the linear operator L to the function f(x) results in a transformed function, which can then be analyzed using its Fourier transform. Knowing the Fourier transform of the resulting function does not allow us to uniquely determine the original function f(x) without additional information."
