  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state. We explore the effects of a transformation given by \\\\( h(z) = e^{i \\theta}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\theta \\\\) is a constant phase shift.\n\nCan we conclusively determine the specific interventions applied (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both) by analyzing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the cumulative and analogous effects of phase shifts from \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( k(z) \\\\), multiple combinations of these transformations could lead to the same observed endpoint at T. The overlap in possible effects from phase shifts makes it difficult to pinpoint which interventions, if any, were actually applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
