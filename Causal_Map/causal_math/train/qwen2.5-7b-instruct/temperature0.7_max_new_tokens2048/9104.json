  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z : \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{C}\\\\) defined by \\\\(z(w) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{iwx}f(x)\\\\,dx\\\\), where \\\\(f(x)\\\\) is a given function and \\\\(w\\\\) is a complex number. We analyze the behavior of this transformation, specifically how it behaves under modifications of \\\\(f(x)\\\\).\n\nGiven the final transformed function \\\\(z(w)\\\\), can we determine exactly the sequence or nature of scalar modifications (values of \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\)) applied to \\\\(f(x)\\\\), knowing the value of \\\\(z(w)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determination of the exact scalars \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) used based solely on the endpoint \\\\(z(w)\\\\) is not feasible. It's due to the fundamental ambiguity in their combined scaling effect since multiple pairs of \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) could lead to equivalent results.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
