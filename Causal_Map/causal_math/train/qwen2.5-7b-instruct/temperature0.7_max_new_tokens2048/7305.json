  "Problem": "Investigate the causal inference in an electrical circuit with a complex function impedance represented by \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{sC} + Ls \\\\), where \\\\(C\\\\) and \\\\(L\\\\) are the capacitance and inductance respectively. We will examine the effect of a transformation defined by the operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), which transforms the input current source \\\\( i(t) \\\\) through a Laplace transform with a added constant shift in the s-plane, \\\\( i(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(i(t)) + k \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the transformed input current \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(i(t)) + k \\\\) at t = 0 is applied to the circuit, and then allowed to evolve under the impedance \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{sC} + Ls \\\\) without further intervention, will the voltage across the circuit \\\\( v(t) \\\\) at time t = T be the same as if \\\\( i(t) \\\\) was directly applied?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of the constant \\\\( k \\\\) in the transformed current changes the initial conditions and the steady-state response, affecting the voltage \\\\( v(t) \\\\) across the circuit. The Laplace transformation and impedance properties will lead to a different voltage waveform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input current i(t) is transformed into i(s) via the Laplace transform, then shifted by k to i(s) + k. This transformed current i(s) + k is used to calculate the output voltage V(s) through the impedance Z(s). Finally, V(s) is inverse transformed into the voltage v(t) which represents the voltage across the circuit at time t."
