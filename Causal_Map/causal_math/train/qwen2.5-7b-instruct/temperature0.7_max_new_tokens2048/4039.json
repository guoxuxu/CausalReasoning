  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in the complex plane, governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number. The transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) is to be considered.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\exp(i\\\\theta)z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a constant, real number) is applied as an intervention and then allowed to evolve, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 solely depend on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and ignore effects of the initial transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the angle of the complex number at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), but since the transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) also affects the state’s magnitude, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is dependent on both changes. Therefore, \\\\( z(T) \\\\) won’t solely depend on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) but also on the effects of the initial squaring and the rotational transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z(t) is directly influenced by ω through the differential equation. Applying g(z) introduces a phase shift that does not affect the long-term dependency on ω, so z(T) will depend primarily on ω and the initial conditions before t_1, ignoring the effect of f(z)."
