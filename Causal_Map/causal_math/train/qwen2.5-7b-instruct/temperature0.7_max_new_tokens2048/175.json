  "Problem": "Examine a scenario involving a linear time-invariant system governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = Mx(t) \\\\) where M is a constant matrix. We consider the impact of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(x(t)) = X(\\\\omega) \\\\) on this system and its implications on system behavior.\n\nAssuming an intervention transforms \\\\( x(t) \\\\) via another operator, say Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), before evolving under \\\\( M \\\\), will the final state \\\\( X(s) \\\\) for the Laplace domain rely solely on M's properties?",
  "Explanation": "An intervention such as a Laplace transform shifts the system representation from time domain into the complex frequency domain. The final state in this domain, \\\\( X(s) \\\\), will depend critically on how M interacts within this new domain created by the transform, not just M alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state x(t) influences both its Fourier transform X(ω) and Laplace transform X(s). The matrix M, through its effect on x(t) over time, determines the final state X(s) in the Laplace domain."
