  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = xe^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) are constants. The transformation \\(\\ T : z \\mapsto z^2 \\) is applied to this function.\n\nGiven the value \\( z(T) \\) observed at time \\( T \\), can we definitively determine both the initial transformation \\( T(z) = z^2 \\) and the exact form of the intervention \\( I(z) = z + c \\) applied at \\( t_1 \\), solely based on the observation of \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of transformations and interventions can potentially yield the same observation \\( z(T) \\), especially given the non-linearity introduced by \\( T \\) and \\( I \\). The presence of exponential terms and added constants can result in overlapping outcomes, making it impossible to uniquely trace back the exact series of transformations and interventions.",
