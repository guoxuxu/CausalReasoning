  "Problem": "Consider a continuous linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(dx/dt = Mx\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We examine the effect of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(x) = S(t)x \\\\) over time t, where S(t) is a transformation that represents shuffling components of x based on another constant matrix S.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we determine exactly what interventions were used (whether \\\\( g(x) \\\\), \\\\( h(x) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The complex interactions between the original matrix M and the intervention matrices S and Q along with their temporal application make it challenging to deconvolve exact interventions from the observing endpoint alone. Multiple combinations of interventions might lead to similar or indistinguishable end states, especially if they do not commute or if their effects are overlapping.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
