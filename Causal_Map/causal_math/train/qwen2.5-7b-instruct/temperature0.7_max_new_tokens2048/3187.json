  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_t + au_x = 0 \\\\), where a is a constant. We explore the effect of applying the Fourier transform to this equation over space and assessing its implication under different integration transformations.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) (where \\\\( 0 < t_1 < T \\\\)), a transformation \\\\( u(x, t_1) = u(x, t_1) + h(x) \\\\) (where h(x) is an arbitrary function) is applied to \\\\( u(x, t_1) \\\\), will the function \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 solely depend on the original PDE?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(x) \\\\) alters the state of the system at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), introducing additional modifications represented by \\\\( \\\\hat{h}(k) \\\\) in the Fourier domain. This intervention will affect the future states including at time T, hence adding dependencies beyond the original PDE characteristics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying an arbitrary function h(x) to u(x, t_1) changes u(x, t_1) which influences u(x, T) but only if the change is not accounted for in the original PDE."
