  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( f(z) \\) defined on the complex plane where \\( f(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z^t \\, dt \\), and \\( s \\) is a fixed complex number. The transformation \\( g(z) = z^s \\) is applied to a complex number \\( z \\).\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\( z_0 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) after computing \\( f(z_0) \\) at \\( t = T \\) without knowing whether \\( g(z) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\( g(z) \\), the original value \\( z_0 \\) cannot be uniquely determined from \\( f(z_0) \\) given the potential modification imposed by \\( g(z) = z^s \\). The properties of the integral and the complex exponential transformation mean multiple values for \\( z_0 \\) could yield the same result after transformation and computation.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Knowing f(z_0) at t = T does not allow us to deduce z_0 directly, and applying g(z_0) → z_0 shows that z_0 can be transformed but this transformation alone is not sufficient to determine z_0 from f(z_0)."
