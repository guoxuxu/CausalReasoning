  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. The behavior of the system is analyzed when a transformation through a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) represented by the matrix multiplication \\\\( Lz \\\\) is introduced.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and the system is then allowed to evolve under the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if the system evolved from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to t = T without the initial transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( L \\\\) to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) modifies the initial condition of the system. Even if \\\\( L \\\\) were a diagonal or a scalar matrix aligned with the dynamics imposed by \\\\( e^{at} \\\\), it changes the initial magnitude or phase, resulting in a different state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the linear operator L to the initial state z_0 results in z_1, which then evolves to z(T) under the function z(t) = e^(at). Directly evolving from z_0 to t = T under the function z(t) = e^(at) results in z(T). The value of the constant a determines the evolution of z(t)."
