  "Problem": "Consider a system given by the integral equation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(t-s)}u(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix, and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) represents an input function to the system. We explore the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( h(y) = e^{Bt}y \\\\) at different time points on system behavior.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(y) \\\\) is applied to the system output at t = 0, and the system is then allowed to evolve under the given integral equation without further intervention, will the output at time T, \\\\( y(T) \\\\), be the same as if no transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(y) = e^{Bt}y \\\\) at t = 0 modifies the initial condition of the system. This alters how the system evolves over time from its original state at t = 0, affecting how the input \\\\( u(t) \\\\) influences the system output, leading to a different outcome at time T due to the altered trajectory initiated by the transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input function u(t) and the constant matrix A directly cause the system output y(t). The time point T directly influences the value of y(T). Applying the transformation h(y) = e^(Bt)y at t=0 affects y(t) initially but does not change the underlying relationship between u(t), A, and y(t) over time, so y(T) would be the same whether the transformation is applied or not."
