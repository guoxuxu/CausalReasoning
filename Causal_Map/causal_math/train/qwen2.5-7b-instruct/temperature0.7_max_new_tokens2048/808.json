  "Problem": "The system is governed by a complex function where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves over time according to the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz\\\\), with A being a real scalar. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{iBs} z(s) ds \\\\), where B is also a real scalar, is analyzed for its effects on the system over time interval [0, T].\n\nGiven the trajectory end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine which transformations or interventions were used (\\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( U(z) \\\\), neither, or both), based solely on the state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Considering multiple transformations involving complex exponential relationships, similar end states \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could be produced through different sequences of transformations and interventions. Therefore, it's impossible to precisely decode the route taken (including particular transformations or interventions) from the end state alone due to the potential overlaps in effects generated by A, B, and C.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
