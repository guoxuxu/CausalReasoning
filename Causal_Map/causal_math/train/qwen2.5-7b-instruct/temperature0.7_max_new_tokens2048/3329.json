  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(f(z) = e^{Az}\\\\) where A is a complex number matrix and z is a complex variable. The function is applied in a system undergoing transformation by a linear operator represented by matrix B. We evaluate the relationship between the application of complex function and how the system evolves over time.\n\nIf the complex function \\\\(f(z)\\\\) is applied at \\\\(z = z_0\\\\), followed by evolution according to the linear operator \\\\(Bz\\\\) without further intervention, will the state at some \\\\(z = Z\\\\) be the same as directly evolving \\\\(z_0\\\\) under \\\\(Bz\\\\) to \\\\(Z\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(f(z)\\\\) at \\\\(z_0\\\\) modifies the initial conditions such that \\\\(z\\\\) becomes \\\\(e^{Az_0}\\\\). This changes how the linear operator \\\\(B\\\\) affects the system, leading to a potentially different state at \\\\(Z\\\\) compared to one evolved directly from \\\\(z_0\\\\) under \\\\(B\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
