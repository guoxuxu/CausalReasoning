  "Problem": "Analyze a system given by the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\Delta u = 0 \\\\) in a domain \\\\( D \\\\), and consider the effect of applying a boundary condition transformation represented by \\\\( u = h(x) \\\\) on \\\\( \\\\partial D \\\\), where \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is a harmonic function.\n\nCan we precisely identify which boundary conditions were applied (whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\), \\\\( g(x) \\\\), or both), given only the solution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for a specific T > t_1?",
  "Explanation": "From the endpoint \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), multiple boundary condition sequences could lead to the same solution inside \\\\( D \\\\) due to the solution properties of harmonic functions and their potential for superposition. Hence, without additional information, it is not possible to uniquely infer which boundary conditions were applied at what times.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
