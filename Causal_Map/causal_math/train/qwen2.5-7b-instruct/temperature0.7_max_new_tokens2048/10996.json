  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where an electrical circuit is represented by a system of linear differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a matrix describing the dynamics of the circuit. The response of this circuit to external stimuli is modeled by applying a transformation \\\\( h(x) = Mx + N \\\\), where M is a matrix and N is a vector.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\), \\\\( j(x) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) can arise from various combinations of interventions as both \\\\( M, N \\\\) and \\\\( Q, R \\\\) can tailor the system's trajectory in a complex manner. The overlapping nature of how these transformations can affect the state vector makes it impossible to determine uniquely which interventions were made.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
