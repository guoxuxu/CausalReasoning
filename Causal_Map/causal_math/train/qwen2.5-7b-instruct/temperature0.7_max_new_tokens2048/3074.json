  "Problem": "Consider a complex dynamic system modeled by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a constant square matrix. The impact on the system's trajectory of applying a transformation \\\\( h(z) = Ce^{Dt}z \\\\), where C and D are also constant matrices, is analyzed.\n\nCan we determine the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing if \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), the modifications introduced by \\\\( Ce^{Dt} \\\\) make it impossible to accurately trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) due to the irreversible effect of matrix D on the trajectory, which may not be uniquely invertible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
