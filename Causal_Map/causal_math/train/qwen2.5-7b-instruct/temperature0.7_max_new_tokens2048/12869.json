  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We are investigating the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}[u(x,t)](k) \\\\) on the function u(x, t).\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) can we recover the initial function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) without knowing whether the Fourier transform was applied at the beginning or at time T?",
  "Explanation": "Because the evolution described by \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\) is deterministic and reversible under the Fourier transform, and given that L is a linear operator, we can uniquely determine \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) from \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) by applying the inverse Fourier transform regardless of when the Fourier transform was applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
