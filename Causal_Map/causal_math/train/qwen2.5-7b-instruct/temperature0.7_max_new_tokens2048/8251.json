  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant. The scenario investigates how the function's behavior changes under various transformations, particularly a transformation applied by an integral operator \\\\(T\\\\) defined by \\\\(Tf(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{i\\\\alpha s} f(s) ds\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a fixed real constant.\n\nIf an additional linear transformation \\\\( Lz(t) = e^{-i\\\\beta t}z(t) \\\\) (where \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) is constant) is applied at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the resultant state at time \\\\(t > t_1\\\\) only depend on the immediate past state without considering historical transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\(Lz(t)\\\\) introduces additional dynamics to the system that are dependent not only on the state of the system at \\\\(t_1\\\\) but also significantly on the parameters of prior transformations (\\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\), \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)). The system's past influences, including the integral transformation, directly impact the future state even after the intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The function z(t) evolves over time according to the integral operator T, and applying the linear transformation L at time t1 modifies z(t) such that its future state z(t2) depends on its state immediately before the transformation."
