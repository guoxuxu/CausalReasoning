  "Problem": "Evaluate the causality in a system governed by the differential equation \\(\\dot{z} = Cz\\), where \\(C\\) is a constant matrix. Analyze this under the operation of the integral transformation represented by \\(\\mathcal{T}(z) = \\int_0^t e^{Dt}z \\, dt\\), where \\(D\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\(\\mathcal{T}(z)\\) is applied to a vector \\(z_0\\) at t = 0, then allowed to evolve under \\(\\dot{z} = Cz\\) without further intervention, will \\(z(t)\\) at t = T be equivalent to directly evolving \\(z_0\\) to t = T under \\(\\dot{z} = Cz\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\(\\mathcal{T}(z)\\) changes the initial condition \\(z_0\\) by adding an integral term, affecting the system's trajectory due to \\(D\\) introducing potentially different dynamics from \\(C\\). At time \\(T\\), \\(z(t)\\) will reflect the compounded impact of both \\(D\\) and \\(C\\), leading to a different final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial vector z_0 directly influences z(t) through the integral transformation represented by D and the exponential function e^(Dt). The constant matrix C directly causes the rate of change of z(t), and the integral transformation mathematically connects e^(Dt)z to the evolution of z from t=0 to t=T."
