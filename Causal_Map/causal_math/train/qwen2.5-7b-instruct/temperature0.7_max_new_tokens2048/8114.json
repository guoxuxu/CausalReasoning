  "Problem": "Consider a complex function integral transformation defined by \\\\( \\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\, dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is an analytic function. We analyze how different transformations by \\\\( f(t) = e^{2t} \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) = t^2 \\\\) without and with interventions affect the transformed function.\n\nCan we uniquely recover the function \\\\( f(t) = e^{2t} \\\\) by knowing its Laplace transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L}(f)(s) \\\\) without any additional information about any interventions?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\\\( \\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-2} \\\\), one can uniquely determine that the original function was \\\\( f(t) = e^{2t} \\\\) because the Laplace transform of exponential functions is uniquely reversible provided the form of the transform is recognized.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The function f(t) = e^(2t) causally influences its Laplace transform L(f)(s) through the integral transformation, and similarly, g(t) = t^2 causally influences its Laplace transform L(g)(s)."
