  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function scenario where the initial function is \\\\( z(t) = C t^2 + iD \\\\), \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) being real numbers. The transformation applied is \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) over time t, with A being a real constant.\n\nGiven the final observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can the exact sequence of transformations (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both were applied) be determined just by knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) may result from various combinations or sequences of transformations. Due to the complexities introduced by the exponential growth factors in both transformations, identifying exactly which transformations were applied, and in what order, without additional information is impractical.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
