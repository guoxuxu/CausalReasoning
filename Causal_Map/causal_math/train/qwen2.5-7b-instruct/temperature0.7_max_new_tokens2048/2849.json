  "Problem": "Consider a complex system where the temperature distribution in a rod is given by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\), representing the heat equation with diffusion coefficient k. To study the influence of surface coatings, a transformation represented by \\\\(u(x,0) = e^{-ax^2}\\\\) is applied at the initial time, where a is a constant.\n\nIf the initial temperature profile \\\\(u(x,0) = e^{-ax^2}\\\\) is applied to the rod at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\) without further intervention, will the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) at T be the same compared to using a plain rod with no initial transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation modifies the initial temperature distribution, thus affecting the entire evolution of the temperature over time. The initial non-uniformity induced by \\\\(e^{-ax^2}\\\\) alters how the heat diffuses throughout the rod, hence affecting the temperature distribution at any given time T.",
