  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real frequency parameter. The effect of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{at}z \\\\) is examined, where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant complex number.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which interventions were applied (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), based solely on the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can result from different sequences or magnitudes of interventions. The exponential properties of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) in \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{bt} \\\\), respectively, influence \\\\( z(T) \\\\) in a way that can yield similar outcomes for various combinations of \\\\( a \\\\), \\\\( b \\\\), and \\\\( t_1 \\\\). Without more specific information about these parameters, the particular interventions cannot be uniquely identified from the endpoint alone.",
