  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = K \\\\nabla^2 u\\\\), where K is a diffusion coefficient, and \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) represents a temperature distribution. Investigate the effects of the transformation \\\\( v(x,t) = u(x,t) e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\), with \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) a positive constant, on the system dynamics over time.\n\nIf an intervention is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) is modified to \\\\( u(x,t) + \\\\beta e^{-\\\\gamma t} \\\\) (\\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\) positive constants), will the state \\\\( v(x,T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on the original diffusion coefficient K and not on \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\), \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\), or \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "This intervention modifies the basic setup by introducing an additional evolving term influenced by \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\), which interacts with the existing dynamics dictated by \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) and K. As a result, the final state of \\\\( v(x, T) \\\\) is a complex interplay of all these parameters, making it dependent on more than just the diffusion coefficient K.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The temperature distribution u(x,t) directly influences the transformed variable v(x,t) through the relation v(x,t) = u(x,t) * e^(-αt). The rate of change of u(x,t) over time, ∂u/∂t, is influenced by the diffusion coefficient K and the Laplacian of u(x,t), ∇²u. Intervening u(x,t) by adding βe^(-γt) does not affect the dependency of v(x,T) on K for T > t₁, as v(x,t) is defined independently of β and γ."
