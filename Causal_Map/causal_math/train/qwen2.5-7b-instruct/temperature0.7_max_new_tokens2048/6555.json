  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of the complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z(t) + k \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing the angular frequency, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. Consider the effect of applying the integral transformation \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-i\\\\omega s}z(s)ds \\\\) on this system.\n\nIf a new intervention defined by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = cz(t) \\\\) (where \\\\( c \\\\) is a new complex constant) is applied at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resulting function at \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) depend only on the original \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( k \\\\) or \\\\( c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new dynamic introduced by \\\\( c \\\\), coupled with the existing parameters \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\), collectively influences the evolved state. Since the differential equation has changed, the resulting trajectory integrates the influences of all these parameters, leading to a state that depends on \\\\( k \\\\), \\\\( c \\\\), as well as \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of z(t) depends on ω through the term iωz(t), on k through the term k, and on c if the intervention occurs after t_1. After t_1, z(t) also depends on c."
