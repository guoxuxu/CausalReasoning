  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions governed by the coupled differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax - By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Bx + Ay \\\\). A transformation is defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{i \\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under the coupled equations without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the original equations?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) = e^{i \\\\omega t}z \\\\) initially modifies the phase of \\\\( z_0 \\\\), leading to a trajectory that evolves differently due to the initial phase shift. The system's response will depend on the interaction between the phase shift introduced by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and the coefficients A and B in the differential equations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
