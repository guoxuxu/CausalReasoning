  "Problem": "We consider a function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = Dz \\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We investigate the impact of a transformation \\( h(z) = Mz \\) applied at time t, where M is a transformation matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0 after observing \\( z(t) \\) at t = T without knowing whether \\( h(z) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\( h(z) \\), the initial condition might have been transformed by M, making it difficult to recover \\( z_0 \\) specifically if M and \\( e^{Dt} \\) do not have easily distinguishable effects, or if M alters the eigenstructure of \\( z_0 \\) relation with D.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z at time t=T is influenced by the initial value of z at time t=0 and the transformation matrix M if it was applied. The application of the transformation h(z) = Mz can alter the trajectory of z from t=0 to t=T."
