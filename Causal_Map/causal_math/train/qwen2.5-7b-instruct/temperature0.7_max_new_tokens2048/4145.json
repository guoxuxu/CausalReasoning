  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex plane \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + c \\\\), where c is a complex constant. We are analyzing the Julia set generated by this function and explore the behavior of points under iterative applications of \\\\( f \\\\).\n\nIf a complex point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is inside the Julia set of \\\\( f \\\\), will iterative applications of \\\\( f \\\\) keep \\\\( z_n = f^n(z_0) \\\\) (\\\\( n \\\\) being the nth iteration) inside the Julia set indefinitely?",
  "Explanation": "Points inside the Julia set remain within the Julia set under iterations of the function \\\\( f \\\\) due to the nature of fractal boundaries in complex dynamics. The structural stability of Julia sets ensures that starting within the set implies remaining in it under iteration.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
