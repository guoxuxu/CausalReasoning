  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{z} e^{s^2} ds \\\\) over the complex plane. We examine the implications of a linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = az + b \\\\) where a and b are complex constants, on points in the complex plane.\n\nCan we determine the original point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after computing \\\\( g(T(z_0)) \\\\) without knowing the parameters of the transformation \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T \\\\) modifies the input point, and without knowing \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), it is mathematically infeasible to uniquely reverse the effect of \\\\( T \\\\) and determine the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( g(T(z_0)) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The original point z_0 is transformed by T to produce T(z_0), and this transformation results in g(T(z_0)). Knowing g(T(z_0)) alone is insufficient to determine z_0 without the parameters of T."
