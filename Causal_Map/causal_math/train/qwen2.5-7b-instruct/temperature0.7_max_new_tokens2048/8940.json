  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( u_{t} + a u_{x} = 0 \\\\) where a is a constant. Let's explore the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x,t)) \\\\) on this equation over time.\n\nKnowing the value of \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what filtering operation was used at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), just from understanding the dynamics defined by a?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Fourier transform does not change the dependency on the parameter a, and the effect of the filtering operation could overlap with natural evolution under \\\\( ia\\\\xi \\\\), it is not possible to uniquely resolve the specific filtering applied at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) based on the final state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, T) \\\\) alone.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The change in u with respect to time (u_t) directly causes the change in u with respect to space (u_x). The function u(x,t) transforms into its Fourier representation (Fourier(u)(ξ,t)), which then evolves over time to become Fourier(u)(ξ,T). Knowing Fourier(u)(ξ,T) allows us to infer the filtering operation applied at time t1."
