  "Problem": "Consider a function mapping complex numbers \\\\( z \\\\) based on a fixed complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + c \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant complex number. This dynamic is influenced by performing different integral transformations on \\\\( z \\\\) over time.\n\nIf an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^1 tz dt \\\\) is applied to an initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and allowed to evolve under \\\\( f \\\\) without further intervention, will the resulting value \\\\( f(z(t)) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 1 \\\\) be the same as directly applying \\\\( f \\\\) to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at \\\\( t = 1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T \\\\) modifies the value of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) by averaging it over a scaled domain, resulting in a potentially different trajectory under the complex function \\\\( f \\\\). Therefore, the transformation will result in a different final state than if \\\\( f \\\\) was directly applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the integral transformation T to z_0 results in z(1), which then evolves under f to produce f(z(T(z_0))), while directly applying f to z_0 at t=1 produces f(z_0)."
