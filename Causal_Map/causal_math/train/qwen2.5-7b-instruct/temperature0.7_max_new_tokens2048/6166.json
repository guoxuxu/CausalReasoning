  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z \\\\) defined in the complex plane as \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), which represents a unit circle parametrized by time t. Analyze how the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) \\\\), is influenced by the introduction of a phase shift \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) in the function, defined as \\\\( f(z) = e^{i(t + \\\\phi)} \\\\).\n\nGiven the Laplace transform of the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a point s, can we infer if a phase shift \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) was applied to \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing only the Laplace transform at a point does not provide enough information to determine the presence of the phase shift, especially because a transform of a shifted time function cannot be uniquely inverted to reveal the exact phase shift without additional information.",
