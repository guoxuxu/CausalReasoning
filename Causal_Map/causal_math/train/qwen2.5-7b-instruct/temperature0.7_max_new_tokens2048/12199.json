  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by Laplace's equation in a complex domain, \\\\( \\\\Delta u = 0 \\\\), for a function \\\\( u: \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\). We investigate the effect of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) applied to an initial condition \\\\( u_0(z) \\\\), evaluated at complex number z, and how its impact is observed over space without and with additional transformations.\n\nGiven the system's resultant state \\\\( u(z) \\\\) after interventions, can we determine precisely what interventions (Fourier transform, \\\\( T(u) \\\\), or both) were used, based solely on observing the outcome \\\\( u(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions from the result \\\\( u(z) \\\\) is highly challenging without additional information. The effects of the Fourier transform and the exponential shift due to \\\\( T(u) \\\\) can create a variety of potential spectral and spatial distributions, making unique identification of interventions impossible based on the final state alone.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u_0(z) directly influences u(z) and its Fourier transform Fourier(u_0)(w), which in turn influences u(z). The transformation T(u)(z) also directly influences u(z), and Fourier(u_0)(w) indirectly influences T(u)(z)."
