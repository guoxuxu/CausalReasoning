  "Problem": "Given a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) that satisfies the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Wz \\\\), where \\\\( W \\\\) is a complex constant, we consider the impact of the transformation map \\\\( g(z) = e^{Jt}z \\\\) where \\\\( J \\\\) is another complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Wz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Wz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at t = 0 changes the initial condition from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( e^{J0}z_0 = z_0 \\\\) (which is unchanged at t = 0), but the behavior for t > 0 will evolve differently due to the differential equation with the modified initial condition, affected by both \\\\( W \\\\) and \\\\( J \\\\), leading to potentially different trajectories.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation map g(z) = e^(Jt)z to z_0 at t = 0 and allowing it to evolve under dz/dt = Wz for time T results in the same z(T) as directly evolving z_0 under dz/dt = Wz from t = 0 to t = T."
