  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions representing position in 2D space over time t. Transformations are applied via \\\\( g(z) = e^{At}z \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nKnowing the position \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, is it possible to uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without confirmation whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied, reconstructing the initial position \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is ambiguous. The function \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) could have altered the trajectory significantly, thus without this knowledge, accurate inference of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) directly from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is mathematically infeasible.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The position at time T (z(T)) depends on the initial position z_0. The transformation g(z) parameterized by A transforms z into g(z). Knowing z(T) allows us to infer z_0 if g(z) was applied."
