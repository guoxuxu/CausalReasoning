  "Problem": "Examine the causal implications in the solution domain of the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az + Bz^2\\\\), where A and B are matrices. We will consider the effects of implementing an integral transformation defined by \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-Bs}s ds \\cdot z \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention is made at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by a new transformation \\\\( H(z) = \\\\int_0^{t_1} e^{-Cs} s ds \\cdot z \\\\) where C is another constant matrix, will the solution \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be entirely dependent on A and not influenced by B or C?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing \\\\( H(z) \\\\) as an intervention modifies the trajectory by influencing the terms involving B and potentially introducing effects involving C. This makes the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on the nature of both B and C transformations along with the influence of A.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
