  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We analyze how the impact of an integral transformation \\\\(T[u]=\\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}u(t) dt\\\\) affects the system.\n\nGiven the state \\\\(u(T)\\\\), can we specify precisely what transformations were applied (whether \\\\(T[u]\\\\), \\\\(S[u]\\\\) or both), just by knowing the state at \\\\(u(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific transformations from the endpoint \\\\(u(T)\\\\) is challenging due to the convolution-like nature of these transformations, which can create similar effects using different parameters (s and k). The integration and exponential effects overlap, making distinct identification unfeasible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
