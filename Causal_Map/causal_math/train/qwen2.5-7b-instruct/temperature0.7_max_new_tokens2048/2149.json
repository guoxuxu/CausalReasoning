  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane and governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We also explore the effect of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\gamma t}z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to an initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T be identically equivalent to the evolution of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) directly under \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\) to T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state, introducing an exponential factor influenced by \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\). This change in the initial condition alters how the system evolves under the differential equation, resulting in a trajectory that differs from that of the unmodified initial state.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of z(t) with respect to time is directly caused by iωz(t). The transformation h(z) directly causes e^(γt)z. At t=0, z0 directly causes z(t). Without further intervention, z(t) directly caused by iωz(t) from t=0 to T is not necessarily identically equivalent to h(z0) evolving under iωz(t) from t=0 to T."
