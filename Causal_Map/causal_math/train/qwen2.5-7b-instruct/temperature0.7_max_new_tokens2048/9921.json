  "Problem": "Consider a wave equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\) defined in a one-dimensional space. We examine the effects of a Fourier transform applied to u(x,0) to analyze the wave's behavior.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, 0)\\\\) of the initial wave function \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) is calculated and then the system evolves according to the wave equation, will the wave's spatial characteristics at any time t be directly predictable from \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, 0)\\\\) without any further information?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform characterizes the frequency components of the wave at t = 0, which determine the wave's evolution in time. The wave equation solution uses these initial spectral components to predict the state at any future time, considering the linear and time-invariant properties of the equation.",
