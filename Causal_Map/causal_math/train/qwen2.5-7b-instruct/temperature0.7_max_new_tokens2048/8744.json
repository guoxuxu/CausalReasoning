  "Problem": "Evaluate the effects of a Fourier transform on a causal system described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = -Ax + u(t) \\\\), where A is a constant scalar and u(t) is an external input. Assume \\\\( U(s) \\\\) is the Laplace transform of u(t) and consider the impact of transforming the initial conditions via a convolution with another function \\\\( h(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven only \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) at a certain frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) after various modifications and interventions in input and dynamics, can we precisely determine what changes were made to A and u(t)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier-transformed output at a given frequency contains limited information, primarily magnitude and phase at that frequency, but lacks detailed visibility into temporal domain events such as specific changes in A or u(t). Frequency domain data post-interventions does not uniquely specify the temporal sequence or nature of modifications in A or u(t).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "u(t) → x(t); A → dx/dt; X(ω) → U(s); U(s) → X(s); h(t) → X(ω); A → X(ω); u(t) → X(ω)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The external input u(t) and the constant scalar A directly affect the state x(t) through the differential equation. The Laplace transform of u(t) is U(s), and the Fourier transform of x(t) is X(ω). The convolution of x(t) with h(t) results in X(ω). Changes in A and u(t) influence X(ω) at a given frequency ω."
