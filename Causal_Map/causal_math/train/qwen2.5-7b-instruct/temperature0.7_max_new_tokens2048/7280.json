  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\( u_t + au_x = 0 \\) where \\( a \\) is a constant. Study the effect of a Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}[u(x,t)] \\) on the variable \\( u \\).\n\nGiven the final state \\( u(x, T) \\), can we determine precisely what transformations were used (whether \\( \\mathcal{F} \\), \\( \\mathcal{G} \\), or both), only by analyzing \\( u(x, T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The end state \\( u(x, T) \\) can potentially be produced through different combinations of transformations and their interactions. The cumulative effect of \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) and \\( \\mathcal{G} \\), alongside the natural evolution under \\( u_t + au_x = 0 \\), creates multiple potential scenarios, which makes it impossible to uniquely determine the interventions just from observing \\( u(x, T) \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The change in u over time (u_t) and the constant a directly cause changes in u. The initial state u(x,t) evolves to the final state u(x,T). The final state u(x,T) influences the determination of the transformations used."
