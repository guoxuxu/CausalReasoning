  "Problem": "Consider a function modeled by a complex variable transformation \\\\( w(z) = e^{z} \\\\) where z is a complex number. We evaluate the effects of an additional transformation defined as \\\\( g(z) = z + a \\\\), where a is a complex constant, on the analytic function w.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( w(z) \\\\) at any point if the function \\\\( g \\\\) was previously applied without knowledge of the value of \\\\( a \\\\) in \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the specific transformation \\\\( g(z) = z + a \\\\), or the value of \\\\( a \\\\), it is impossible to accurately trace back to the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The transformation could involve any shift in the complex plane, making it non-deducible from the end value alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
