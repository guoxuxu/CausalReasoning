  "Problem": "Consider the system modeled by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}x(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) satisfies the equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\), with D being a constant matrix. We analyze the effect of applying the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\) to this system and studying its evolution.\n\nIf the system starts from an initial complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and evolves according to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}x(t) \\\\) without further changes, will the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be equivalent to directly taking the Laplace transform of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) multiplied by \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The properties of the Laplace transform allow for the distribution over multiplication by exponential functions. Thus, the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) will indeed be the transform of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) adjusted by the constant \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), resulting in \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = e^{-st} \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{x(t)\\\\}(s-i\\\\omega) \\\\).",
