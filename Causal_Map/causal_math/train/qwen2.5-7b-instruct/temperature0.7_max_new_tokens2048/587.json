  "Problem": "Consider the integral transform of a given function \\( p(x) \\) defined as \\( q(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} p(x) e^{-tx} dx \\), known in mathematics as the Laplace transform in specific settings. This scenario involves comparing the original function \\( p(x) \\) and its transformation, \\( q(t) \\), and understanding the implications of transformations and their inverses on inference without and with interventions.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\( p(x) \\) to \\( p(x) + r(x) \\) where r(x) is another function, and a new transform \\( s(t) \\) is computed, does \\( s(t) \\) result solely due to the properties of \\( p(x) \\) independent of \\( r(x) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new transform \\( s(t) \\) will reflect the changes introduced by \\( r(x) \\). Since integral transforms like the Laplace transform are linear, \\( s(t) \\) will include effects of both \\( p(x) \\) and \\( r(x) \\), expressed as \\( s(t) = q(t) + \\int r(x) e^{-tx} dx \\).",
