  "Problem": "Consider a functional equation \\\\( v(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty K(x,t)u(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( K(x,t) \\\\) is a kernel function and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is an input function. The transformation applied is \\\\( w(x) = v(x) + c \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the observed output \\\\( w(x) \\\\) at x = X, can we determine the exact form of the initial function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) without knowing the constant \\\\( c \\\\) added to \\\\( v(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of a constant \\\\( c \\\\) to \\\\( v(x) \\\\) obscures the original mapping from \\\\( u(t) \\\\) to \\\\( v(x) \\\\). Without knowledge of \\\\( c \\\\), multiple possible \\\\( u(t) \\\\) could yield the same observed \\\\( w(x) \\\\), since different combinations of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\) can yield the same result.",
