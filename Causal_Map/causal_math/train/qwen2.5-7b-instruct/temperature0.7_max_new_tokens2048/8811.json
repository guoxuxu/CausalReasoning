  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transformation of a time-dependent function \\\\( u(t) \\\\), given as \\\\( U(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). We analyze the behavior of the system when subjected to different kernel transformations \\\\( h(t) \\\\) leading to a convolution integral \\\\( (u*h)(t) = \\\\int_0^t u(\\\\tau)h(t-\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) and its impact on the output used in signal processing.\n\nIf we apply an additional operation \\\\( g(t) \\\\) on \\\\( u(t) \\\\) after the convolution with \\\\( h(t) \\\\), transforming this result by Laplace, will the final transform equal the product \\\\( U(s)H(s)G(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform respects linearity and convolution operations. If \\\\( g(t) \\\\) modifies \\\\( u(t) \\\\) or the convolution result, the final Laplace transform will incorporate it as a multiplicative factor. Thus, the resulting transform is the product of the Laplace transforms of individual modified inputs, reflecting the effects of sequential transformations (causes) on the outcome.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace transform of the convolution of u(t) with h(t) is the product of their individual Laplace transforms, i.e., U(s)H(s), and applying g(t) to the convolution before taking the Laplace transform results in the product U(s)H(s)G(s)."
