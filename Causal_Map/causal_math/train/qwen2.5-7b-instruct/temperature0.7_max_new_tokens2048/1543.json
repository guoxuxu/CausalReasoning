  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) representing a circular motion in the complex plane. We then examine the impact of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) applied to this system.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\\\), an intervention \\\\( h(z) = e^{-i\\pi}z \\\\) is applied, will this affect the state at a later time \\\\( t = \\pi \\\\) compared to just evolving under \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) and not considering \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) effectively introduces a phase shift which, combined with the initial application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), alters the periodic trajectory differently compared to only evolving under \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\). This leads to a change in both the phase and position at \\\\( t = \\pi \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "h(z) → z(t=π); z(t=π/2) → z(t=π); g(z) → z(t=π); z(t=π/2) → g(z); g(z) → z(t=π)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The intervention h(z) directly affects z(t=π). The initial state z(t=π/2) influences z(t=π) through both the transformation g(z) and the evolution of z(t). The transformation g(z) also directly influences z(t=π)."
