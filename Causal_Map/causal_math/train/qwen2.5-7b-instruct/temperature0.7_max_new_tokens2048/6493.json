  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving in a potential field described by the potential function \\\\( V(x) = -\\\\alpha x^2 + \\\\beta x^4 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) are constants. Investigate the effects of perturbing the initial position of the particle using a transformation \\\\( g(x) = x + \\\\delta \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\) is a small constant, on the system's long-term behavior.\n\nIf the initial position \\\\( x_0 \\\\) of the particle is perturbed by \\\\( g(x) \\\\) to become \\\\( x_0 + \\\\delta \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under the system dynamics without further intervention, will the trajectory of the particle be the same as if it started from \\\\( x_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The perturbation alters the initial conditions. For nonlinear systems such as this, even small changes in initial conditions can lead to significant divergence in the trajectories over time, due to the sensitive dependence on initial conditions typical of systems with nonlinear dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial position x_0, when transformed by g(x) to x_0 + δ, influences the particle's trajectory through the potential function V(x), which determines the system's energy E, leading to a different trajectory compared to starting from x_0."
