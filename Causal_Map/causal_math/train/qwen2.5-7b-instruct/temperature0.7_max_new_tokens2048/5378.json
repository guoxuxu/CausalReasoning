  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x, y) \\\\) defined by the integral transformation \\\\( z(x, y) = \\\\int_{0}^{y} e^{At} x(t) dt \\\\) where A is a constant matrix and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent vector function. We assess how applying an operational matrix \\\\( H \\\\) impacts the behavior of \\\\( z \\\\) when integrated to time \\\\( y \\\\).\n\nBased solely on the output \\\\( z(x, y) \\\\), can we deduce whether the matrix \\\\( H \\\\) was applied to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) before integration?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing only the value of \\\\( z(x, y) \\\\), one cannot determine if \\\\( x(t) \\\\) was modified by \\\\( H \\\\) before integration due to the potential overlap of results from different functions \\\\( x(t) \\\\) that could yield similar or identical integrals.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of matrix H to the vector function x(t) precedes the integration process that defines z(x, y). Therefore, H → x(t) and x(t) → z(x, y)."
