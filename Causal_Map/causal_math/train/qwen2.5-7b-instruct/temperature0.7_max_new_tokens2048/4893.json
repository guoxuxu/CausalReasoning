  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( w(z) = z^2 \\\\) where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. We assess the effects of the integral transformation \\\\( T[f](z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-zt} f(t) dt \\\\), applied to a function \\\\( f(t) = t^k \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a positive integer.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T[f](z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( f(t) = t^k \\\\) without additional transformations, will \\\\( T[f](z) \\\\) for a specific \\\\( z \\\\) be a constant regardless of \\\\( k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The result of the transformation \\\\( T[f](z) = \\\\Gamma(k+1) z^{-(k+1)} \\\\) clearly depends on \\\\( k \\\\), as shifting the power of \\\\( t \\\\) in the function directly influences the outcome of the integral and hence the exponent in the resulting expression.",
