  "Problem": "Consider a Laplace transform analysis on an electrical circuit governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2V}{dt^2} + 2\\\\zeta\\\\omega\\\\frac{dV}{dt} + \\\\omega^2V = 0\\\\), where \\\\(V\\\\) is the voltage across a component, and \\\\(\\\\zeta\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) are constants related to damping and angular frequency. Analyzing the response of the system under different initial voltages is of interest, comparing it to transformed conditions using \\\\(f(V) = V + e^{\\\\alpha t}V\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the transform \\\\(f(V)\\\\) is applied to an initial voltage function \\\\(V_0(t)\\\\) and allowed to evolve under the system's differential equation with no further intervention, will the response at time \\\\(T\\\\) be the same as applying the system's differential equation directly to \\\\(V_0(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The exponential term in \\\\(f(V) = V + e^{\\\\alpha t}V\\\\) modifies the initial condition by adding a function that grows or decays exponentially (based on \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\)). This alteration changes the original system dynamics, impacting how \\\\(V(t)\\\\) evolves over time and resulting in a different response at time \\\\(T\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "V_0(t) → V(T); f(V) → V'(t); V'(t) → V(T); V_0(t) → V'(t)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial voltage V_0(t) directly causes the voltage V(T) through the system's differential equation. Applying the transform f(V) to V_0(t) results in V'(t), which also directly causes V(T) through the same differential equation. Therefore, without further intervention, the response at time T will be the same whether the system's differential equation is applied directly to V_0(t) or to V'(t)."
