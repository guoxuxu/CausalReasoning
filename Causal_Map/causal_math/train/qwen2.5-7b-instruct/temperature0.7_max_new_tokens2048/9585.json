  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex-differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + Az\\\\) where \\\\(z\\\\) is a complex function, \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant, and A is a constant matrix. We explore the impact of an integral transform \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Bs}z(s) ds \\\\), where B is a constant matrix, over different times t.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the function is allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + Az\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time T match the solution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolved without applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) transforms the state of the system by integrating it over time, which alters the trajectory from its original path. The presence of B in the integral changes the dynamics such that \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will differ due to the initial modification imparted by \\\\( f(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
