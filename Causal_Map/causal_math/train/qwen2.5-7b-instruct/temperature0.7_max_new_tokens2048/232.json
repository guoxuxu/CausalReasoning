  "Problem": "Let's consider a linear partial differential equation (PDE) of the form \\\\( u_t + Au_x = 0 \\\\), where A is a constant coefficient. We explore the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) \\\\) to this equation, and subsequently manipulating the transformed equation.\n\nCan we conclusively determine which transformations (Fourier, Laplace, or none) were used at any intermediate step before reaching the solution at time T, based solely on the knowledge of \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The solution at time T can be obtained through different sequences of transforms and interventions, depending on the handling of the transforms and boundary/initial conditions. The final state does not uniquely identify the path of transformations used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Fourier transform to the original PDE results in a transformed equation, which when inverse-transformed, gives u(x, T). Knowing u(x, T) alone does not conclusively determine whether the Fourier transform was used, Laplace transform, or no transform was applied at any intermediate step."
