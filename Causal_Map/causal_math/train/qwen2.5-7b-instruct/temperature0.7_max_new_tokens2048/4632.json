  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = (x(t), y(t)) \\\\) in the complex plane, where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts, respectively. The dynamics of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), with \\\\( M \\\\) being a complex matrix. Analyze the impact of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\), where \\\\( N \\\\) is also a complex matrix.\n\nKnowing the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine the interventions (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( j(z) \\\\), or both) used, based only on the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the complexity and non-commutative nature of the transformations involved, and the ability of different matrices to yield similar effects when exponentiated and applied to complex vectors, it is challenging to uniquely identify which interventions were used. Multiple combinations of \\\\( N \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\) with \\\\( M \\\\) can lead to the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of z(t) under the differential equation Mz → ż determines its state at time T, while the transformation e^(Nt)z → z(T) modifies z(t) to its value at time T."
