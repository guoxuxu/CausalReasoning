  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( bi \\\\) are real and imaginary components of the complex exponent respectively. The system is subject to the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{(c+di)t}z \\\\), with \\\\( c \\\\), \\\\( d \\\\) being constants. Analyze the evolution and causality of this system over time.\n\nAssuming a transformation \\\\( g'(z) = e^{(e+fi)t}z \\\\) is applied as an intervention at \\\\( t = t_1 < T \\\\), will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend only on the initial parameters \\\\( a, b \\\\) and not on \\\\( e, f \\\\) or \\\\( c, d \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional intervention with \\\\( g'(z) \\\\) significantly affects the trajectory. Now, the state at \\\\( T \\\\) is a result of the multiple exponentials influencing it over different time intervals, making the final state contingent on all parameters \\\\( a, b, c, d, e, f \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
