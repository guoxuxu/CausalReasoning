  "Problem": "Assume we have a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the complex differential equation \\\\( z'(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency. The influence of the linear transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) being another real constant and \\\\( t \\\\) denoting time, is considered.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and allowed to evolve under the original differential equation without any further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > 0 \\\\) equal the solution had \\\\( z_0 \\\\) been evolved directly under the differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) changes the initial condition to \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha \\\\cdot 0} z_0 = z_0 \\\\), but alters the type of evolution due to the multiplicative factor \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\. Therefore, the resulting function will accumulate factors from both the exponential growth caused by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and the oscillatory behavior imposed by \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\), resulting in a different trajectory from the original equation.",
