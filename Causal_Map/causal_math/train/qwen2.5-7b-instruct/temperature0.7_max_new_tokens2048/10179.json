  "Problem": "We consider the behavior of functions over complex domains and examine the impact of an integral transformation. Let \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) be defined on the complex plane minus the origin z = 0 and let an integral transformation \\\\( T(f) \\\\) be defined by \\\\( T(f) = \\\\int_{C} f(z) dz \\\\), where C is a closed contour around the origin.\n\nIf a regularization function \\\\( g(z) = z \\\\) is multiplied to \\\\( f(z) \\\\) before applying the integral transformation \\\\( T(f) \\\\), does the result of \\\\( T(fg) \\\\) remain 2\\\\pi i?",
  "Explanation": "The multiplication by \\\\( g(z) = z \\\\) changes the nature of the function from \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) to \\\\( fg(z) = 1 \\\\), a non-singular function over the complex plane, including the origin. The integral over a closed contour of a non-singular function (like a constant 1) results in zero, reflecting a significant change due to this intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function f(z) = 1/z, when integrated around a closed contour C around the origin, results in 2πi. Multiplying f(z) by g(z) = z yields fg(z), which changes the integral's value unless the multiplication cancels out the singularity at z=0, but in this case, it does not, so T(fg) does not remain 2πi."
