  "Problem": "Consider a closed-loop feedback system described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Kx + Lu \\\\), where \\\\( K \\\\) and \\\\( L \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( u \\\\) is the control input. We are examining the system's behavior under the integral transformation given by \\\\( T(x) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{(K+L)s} ds \\\\cdot x \\\\).\n\nIf intervention by transformation \\\\( S(x) = \\\\int_{0}^{t_1} e^{M s} ds \\\\cdot x \\\\) (where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant matrix) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), is the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) solely dependent on \\\\( K \\\\) and \\\\( L \\\\) but not on \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with transformation \\\\( S(x) \\\\) potentially adds an overlay of integration involving \\\\( M \\\\), affecting the trajectory and final state at time \\\\( T \\\\). Consequently, the state of the system at \\\\( T \\\\) becomes dependent on \\\\( M \\\\), in addition to \\\\( K \\\\) and \\\\( L \\\\).",
