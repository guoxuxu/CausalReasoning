  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit governed by the differential equation \\\\(L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t)\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is inductance, \\\\(R\\\\) is resistance, and \\\\(V(t)\\\\) is a time-varying voltage source. Analyze the effect of applying a linear time-invariant system transformation characterized by the impulse response function \\\\(h(t) = e^{-\\\\alpha t}\\\\) for \\\\(t \\\\geq 0\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(h(t)\\\\) is applied to the voltage source \\\\(V(t)\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\), and then the circuit is allowed to evolve under \\\\(L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t)\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(I(t)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\) be the same as if \\\\(V(t)\\\\) without transformation was directly applied under \\\\(L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(h(t)\\\\) modifies the input voltage \\\\(V(t)\\\\) to a new function, changing how the current \\\\(I(t)\\\\) evolves over time. The transformation affects the entire dynamics of the circuit by altering the input, resulting in a different current at any time \\\\(T\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "V(t) → I(t); h(t) → V'(t); V'(t) → I(t)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The original voltage source V(t) directly influences the current I(t); applying the transformation h(t) results in a new voltage source V'(t) which also directly influences I(t); therefore, the current I(t) at time T will differ if V(t) is transformed before application compared to using V(t) directly."
