  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + v\\\\cdot\\\\nabla u = 0\\\\), where \\\\(u(t,x)\\\\) represents the state of the system and \\\\(v\\\\) is a constant velocity vector. The impact of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) applied to the initial condition \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) is studied to determine its effect over time.\n\nIf at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), another transformation, such as the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\), is applied as an intervention, will the ultimate state \\\\(u(T,x)\\\\) at \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) depend only on the velocity \\\\(v\\\\) and not on the transformations applied?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform alters the system in a different manner, particularly in the complex frequency domain, which affects how the system's state evolves thereafter. The final state \\\\(u(T, x)\\\\) will then depend on both initial and intermediate transformations (Fourier and Laplace), not just on \\\\(v\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state u(T,x) at time T depends on the velocity v and the initial condition u_0(x), and is influenced by the Fourier transform applied to u_0(x); applying the Laplace transform at t_1 does not change this dependency."
