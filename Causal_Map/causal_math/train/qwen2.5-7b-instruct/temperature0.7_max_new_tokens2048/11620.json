  "Problem": "Consider a system under a linear transformation described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We investigate the effects of applying a Fourier transform defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) over the function z(t).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( F(z) \\\\), \\\\( F^{-1}(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specifically whether Fourier or inverse Fourier transforms—or both—were applied solely from the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is complex. The modifications due to transformations in and out of frequency domain can result in multiple potential histories yielding the same or indistinguishably similar end states due to the nature of these transformations obscuring or altering original function characteristics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
