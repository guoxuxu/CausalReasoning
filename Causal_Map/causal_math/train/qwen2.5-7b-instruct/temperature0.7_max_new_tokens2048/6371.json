  "Problem": "Consider the equation of a vibrating string given by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is the speed of the wave in the string and \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) represents the displacement at position \\\\( x \\\\) and time \\\\( t \\\\). An external forcing term \\\\( F(x,t) \\\\) is added to the system, resulting in a modified equation \\\\( u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx} + F(x,t) \\\\).\n\nIf a specific force pattern \\\\( F(x,t) = g(t) \\\\) is applied at some time interval and then switched off, will the string's displacement \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) solely depend on the original wave equation \\\\( u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx} \\\\) for times larger than when \\\\( g(t) \\\\) was last applied?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction and subsequent removal of the force \\\\( g(t) \\\\) impacts the initial conditions post-intervention. Therefore, the resultant trajectory of the string is influenced by the interplay of the natural dynamics and the temporary forcing, affecting the displacement at later times.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An external force F(x,t) influences the displacement u(x,t) of the string, which in turn determines the displacement u(x,T) at a later time T. Once the force is removed, the displacement evolution is governed by the original wave equation u_tt = c^2 u_xx."
