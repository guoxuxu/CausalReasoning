  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output voltage \\( V(t) \\) in an RLC circuit is governed by the differential equation \\( L \\frac{d^2V}{dt^2} + R \\frac{dV}{dt} + \\frac{1}{C} V = 0 \\), where L, R, and C are constants representing the inductance, resistance, and capacitance respectively. We examine the impact of a Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{V(t)\\} \\) applied to the voltage \\( V(t) \\) and its inverse transform.\n\nIf an intervention is applied at time \\( t_1 \\) where a sudden change in resistance \\( R \\) occurs, will the subsequent voltage \\( V(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) be solely determined by the initial RLC values?",
  "Explanation": "The sudden change in resistance \\( R \\) alters the characteristics of the governing differential equation. This intervention affects the decay rates and oscillatory behavior of \\( V(t) \\), thus the output \\( V(T) \\) will not only be dependent on the initial conditions and natural response but also on the new resistance value.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "A sudden change in resistance R at time t_1 directly causes changes in the voltage V(T) for T > t_1, which in turn is influenced by the initial values of R, L, and C."
