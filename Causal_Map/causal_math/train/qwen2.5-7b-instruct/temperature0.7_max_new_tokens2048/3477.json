  "Problem": "Consider a wave function \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t)\\\\) that is governed by the Schrodinger equation with a potential \\\\(V(x)\\\\). An integral transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(\\\\psi) = \\\\int h(x) \\\\psi(x,t) dx \\\\) is studied, where \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is a fixed function.\n\nIf \\\\( f(\\\\psi) \\\\) is computed for an initial wave function at t = 0, and then \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t)\\\\) is evolved over time t under the Schrodinger equation without further application of \\\\( f \\\\), will the computation of \\\\( f(\\\\psi) \\\\) at a later time t = T be affected by its initial calculation?",
  "Explanation": "The computation of \\\\( f(\\\\psi) \\\\) at t = 0 does not modify \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t)\\\\). Thus, the wave function evolves solely based on the dictated dynamics of the Schrodinger equation, independent of the initial calculation of \\\\( f(\\\\psi) \\\\). The changes in \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t)\\\\) over time are dictated by the potential \\\\(V(x)\\\\) and not the initial application of the transformation \\\\( f \\\\).",
