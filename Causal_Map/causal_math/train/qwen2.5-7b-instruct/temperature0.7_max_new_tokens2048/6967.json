  "Problem": "Let's examine a complex function scenario given by the equation \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), which traces a unit circle in the complex plane as a function of time t. We are interested in the effect of a transformation using another function, \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\), applied to this time-varying function.\n\nIf at some point before time T, another transformation, \\\\( k(z) = z^3 \\\\), is applied, will the path at time T solely reflect the influence of the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and not the transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( k(z) = z^3 \\\\) introduces an additional change in both magnitude and angular velocity of the complex path, making the resulting path at time T a combination of the effects of the original function and the transformations applied. The trajectory becomes a combination of these influences, reflecting cubic growth in angular displacement.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
