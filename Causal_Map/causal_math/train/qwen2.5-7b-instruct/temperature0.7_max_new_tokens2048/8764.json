  "Problem": "Consider an electrical RLC circuit where the current I(t) depends on the applied voltage V(t) through the differential equation \\\\(L\\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI + \\\\frac{1}{C} \\\\int I dt = V(t)\\\\), where L is the inductance, R is the resistance, and C is the capacitance. Analyze different scenarios when mathematical transformations are applied to the voltage by a function \\\\(g(V) = e^{st}V\\\\) representing a scaling of the voltage by an exponential function over time t, where s is a constant.\n\nGiven only the information about the current I(T) at time T, can one determine what transformations were applied to the voltage function, specifically distinguishing between \\\\(g(V)\\\\) and \\\\(h(V)\\\\), or whether both were used?",
  "Explanation": "The terminal current I(T) can potentially be achieved through different series of modifications to the voltage sourced by both \\\\(g(V)\\\\) and \\\\(h(V)\\\\). The overlap in possible dynamical pathways due to the differential nature of the system and the wide range of potential exponential interactions disguises the specific interventions applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The applied voltage V(t) directly influences the current I(t). The voltage V(t) can be transformed by functions g(V) or h(V), with g(V) scaling the voltage by an exponential factor over time, while the specific transformation applied cannot be uniquely determined from I(T) alone without additional information."
