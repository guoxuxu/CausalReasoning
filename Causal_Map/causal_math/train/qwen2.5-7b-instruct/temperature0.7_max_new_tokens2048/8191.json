  "Problem": "We study a vector field \\\\( z(t) \\\\) affected by two processes: multiplication by a complex function \\\\( h(z) = e^{iwt}z \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency, and a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) applied over time. We aim to understand how these transformations impact \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from initial time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( t = T \\\\).\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) (where \\\\( 0 < t_1 < T \\\\)), an intervention applies another complex function \\\\( j(z) = e^{-iwt}z \\\\), will the final result of \\\\( F(z(T)) \\\\) depend solely on the intervention and not on the initial application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( j(z) \\\\) partially counteracts the effect of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), but does not wholly negate its impact due to potential residual effects between time intervals. The final state \\\\( F(z(T)) \\\\) depends on both the initial and intervening transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of h(z) influences z(t), which then determines the input for F(z(T)). The intervention j(z) affects z(t1), changing its value before it is transformed by F(z(T)). The final result of F(z(T)) depends on both the initial application of h(z) and the subsequent intervention j(z), rather than solely on the intervention."
