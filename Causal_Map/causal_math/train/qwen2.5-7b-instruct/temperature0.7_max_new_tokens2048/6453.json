  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the partial differential equation \\(\\partial_t u = Lu\\), where \\(L\\) is a linear differential operator. We examine the effect of a Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) applied to the function \\(u(x, 0)\\) at \\(t = 0\\).\n\nIf \\(\\mathcal{F}(u(x, 0))\\) is computed at t = 0 and then \\(u(x, t)\\) evolves under \\(\\partial_t u = Lu\\) for time \\(t > 0\\) without further intervention, will the solution \\(u(x, t)\\) at time \\(T\\) be the same as if \\(u(x, 0)\\) was used directly without the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform changes the initial state representation to the frequency domain, which affects how the solution evolves under the differential operator \\(L\\). The inverse Fourier transform would be required to bring \\(u(x, t)\\) back to the spatial domain, making the solution intrinsically different unless \\(L\\) specifically supports an invariant transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Fourier transform to u(x, 0) and then evolving the result under the PDE leads to the same solution u(x, t) as directly using u(x, 0) and evolving it, provided no additional interventions occur."
