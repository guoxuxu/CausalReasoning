  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. We're curious about the nature of the function under the Laplace transform, defined by the integral transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\). Consider s as a complex parameter and investigate specific properties under direct transformations and interventions.\n\nGiven the result of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) \\\\), can we infer the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) directly if we assume no knowledge of the complex path or any branch cuts considered in the integration?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the chosen path or handling of branch cuts in the complex plane, it is impossible to accurately determine \\\\( f(t) = e^{t^2} \\\\) from \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) \\\\). The complex exponential raises issues related to multivalued functions and essential singularities that can obfuscate direct inference.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The complex parameter s influences the Laplace transform L(f)(s) of the function f(t) through integration, and knowing L(f)(s) allows us to understand the properties of f(t) but does not directly infer f(t) without additional information."
