  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( h(z) = e^{kz} \\\\), where k is a complex constant. We examine the implications of applying the integral transformation \\\\( H(w) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} h(z) e^{-iwz} dz \\\\), where w is a real constant representing frequency.\n\nIf an alteration or modification, represented by a differential operator \\\\( D(w) = \\\\frac{d}{dw} \\\\), is applied before transforming \\\\( h(z) \\\\) with \\\\( H(w) \\\\), will the transformation then accurately express the original h(z) without distortions?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the differential operator alters the characteristics of the resulting function by modifying frequency components differentially. Instead of simply transforming the function, it will effectively change the waveform, thereby not accurately reflecting the original function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) through \\\\( H(w) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
