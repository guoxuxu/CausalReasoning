  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear operator. We explore the influence of a transformation characterized by the function \\\\( t(x) = \\\\int e^{sx} ds \\\\) on spatial variable x, where s represents a parameter.\n\nCan we infer the original function \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing if \\\\( t(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( t(x) \\\\), it is impossible to ascertain if the initial function was modified. The transformation induced by the integral might change the initial function in a non-reversible way, especially in complex systems with non-linear operators or mixed boundary conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
