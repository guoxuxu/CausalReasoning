  "Problem": "Consider the effect of a Fourier Transform on a given function \\\\( g(t) = e^{-at^2} \\\\), where \\\\( a > 0 \\\\) is a constant. The Fourier Transform of this function is defined as \\\\( G(f) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-at^2} e^{-i2\\\\pi ft} dt \\\\). Analyze the outcomes of various implementation scenarios and their reverse causality.\n\nIf we apply a modulation \\\\( m(t) = e^{bt} \\\\) (where \\\\( b \\\\) is a constant) to \\\\( g(t) \\\\) before the Fourier Transform, will the resulting \\\\( G(f) \\\\) still correspond to the original transformation without the modulation?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing a modulation such as \\\\( m(t) \\\\) alters the time domain function to \\\\( g(t)e^{bt} \\\\), which significantly modifies its Fourier transform. The resulting Fourier Transform will reflect the combined effects of both \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and \\\\( m(t) \\\\), thus diverging from the original \\\\( G(f) \\\\) without intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function g(t) directly influences G(f) through its Fourier Transform. Applying modulation m(t) to g(t) before the Fourier Transform results in a modified G(f), indicating that g(t) indirectly influences G(f) via m(t)."
