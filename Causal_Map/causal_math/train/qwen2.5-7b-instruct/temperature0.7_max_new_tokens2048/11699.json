  "Problem": "Consider a function representing a complex variable transformation given by \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant representing angular frequency, and z is a complex variable. We are considering the evolution of this transformation over time t and its impact when combined with an integral transformation defined by \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex parameter.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is another complex constant) is applied as an intervention at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) after applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\), will the final outcome of \\\\( G(z(T)) \\\\) for T > t_1 rely solely on the integral transformation and not on the nature of \\\\( f \\\\) or \\\\( h \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces a new complex scaling on the evolving variable, which will alter both the magnitude and phase of z. This, combined with the initial rotational effect from \\\\( f(z) \\\\), means that the final result of \\\\( G(z(T)) \\\\) will be influenced by both transformations and not just the integral transformation alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Time t influences z(t). Angular frequency ω influences the transformation f(z). Complex parameter s influences the transformation G(z(t)). Time t_1 influences the application of h(z) which affects z(T). The final outcome G(z(T)) depends on z(T) but not directly on f or h."
