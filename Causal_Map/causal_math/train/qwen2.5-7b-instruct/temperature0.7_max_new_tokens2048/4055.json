  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + A \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} = 0 \\\\), where A is a constant. We explore the behavior of the system under the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t, x)\\\\} = U(s, x) \\\\) and the subsequent inversion to the time domain.\n\nIf an additional boundary condition modulated by a function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is inserted at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) during the evolution, will the solution \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\) at t > t_1 solely depend on the initial function \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) and independent of the new boundary condition \\\\( g(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Once a boundary condition is inserted as an intervention, the solution \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\) becomes dependent on this new condition. The differential equation hence integrates this boundary effect throughout the subsequent evolution of the system, modifying the profile of \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\) at any time after \\\\( t_1 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The partial derivative of u with respect to t and the second partial derivative of u with respect to x directly cause each other through the given PDE. The function g(x) influences U(s, x) through the Laplace transform, which in turn affects u(t, x)."
