  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 v = 0\\\\) in a domain \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\). Assess the effect of the boundary condition alteration defined through \\\\( v' = v + h \\\\) on the boundary \\\\(\\\\Gamma\\\\), where \\\\(h\\\\) is a known function defined on \\\\(\\\\Gamma\\\\).\n\nIf the boundary condition is modified from \\\\(v\\\\) to \\\\(v' = v + h\\\\) on \\\\(\\\\Gamma\\\\) without any intermediate changes, will the solution \\\\(v'(x)\\\\) inside \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\) solely depend on the new boundary conditions without referencing the original conditions \\\\(v\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The solution \\\\(v'(x)\\\\) in \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\) will adjust to reflect the new boundary conditions. Since Laplace's equation is linear and boundary-value problems are well-posed, the interior solution will transition to meet \\\\(v'\\\\) on \\\\(\\\\Gamma\\\\) irrespective of the original condition \\\\(v\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
