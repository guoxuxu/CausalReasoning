  "Problem": "Investigate the stability of a system represented by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real number denoting angular frequency and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state. We consider the effect of an external transformation \\\\( h(z) = cz \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a non-zero complex constant.\n\nKnowing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we unambiguously determine the specific transformations applied (either \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both)?",
  "Explanation": "Different combinations of complex constants \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\), even if applied in different orders, can yield the same final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) due to properties of complex multiplication, making it impossible to pinpoint exactly which transformations were applied, or in which order.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The angular frequency w determines the evolution of the complex function z(t), the initial state z_0 sets the starting point of z(t), the transformation c defines the external transformation h(z), and the function z(t) evolves under h(z) to reach the state z(T) at time T."
