  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. This function represents an oscillatory behavior in the complex plane. We explore the effect of a transformation \\\\( T(z) = z^n \\\\), where \\\\( n \\\\) is a positive integer, on the function's behavior.\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under its natural oscillatory behavior without further intervention, will the transformed function \\\\( T(z(t)) \\\\) at a later time t = T exhibit the same frequency of oscillation as the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation changes the fundamental frequency of the oscillation. Specifically, \\\\( T(z(t)) = T(e^{i\\omega t}) = (e^{i\\omega t})^n = e^{i n \\omega t} \\\\), so the frequency is multiplied by \\\\( n \\\\). Therefore, the frequency of oscillation in \\\\( T(z(t)) \\\\) is different from the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The angular frequency ω directly influences both z(t) and T(z(t)). Applying the transformation T with exponent n to z(t) results in T(z(t)), which evolves over time t. At time t = T, the frequency of oscillation of T(z(t)) remains the same as that of z(t) because the transformation does not alter the underlying frequency ω."
