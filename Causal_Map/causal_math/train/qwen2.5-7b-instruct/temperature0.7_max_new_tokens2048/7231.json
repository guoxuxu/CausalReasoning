  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) under the Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\). Here, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number and \\\\( t \\\\) denotes time.\n\nAssuming an intervention modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z'(t) = e^{(i \\\\omega + a)t} \\\\) at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real number, does the Laplace transformed function \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\) still depend solely on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the function to \\\\( z'(t) = e^{(i \\\\omega + a)t} \\\\), and its Laplace transform becomes \\\\( Z'(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i \\\\omega - a} \\\\). This transformed function now depends on both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and the intervention parameter \\\\( a \\\\), indicating a dependency beyond just \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Intervention modifying z(t) to z'(t) at t=0 leads to a change in the Laplace transformed function Z'(s), which now depends on both omega and a."
