  "Problem": "Given a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) a real constant. We examine the effect of applying the Fourier transform \\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf an additional function \\( g(t) = e^{i\\\\theta t} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a constant) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) as an intervention at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resultant Fourier transform for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) still reflect the same frequency spectrum as the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(t) \\\\) results in the modified function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i(\\\\omega + \\\\theta) t}z_0 \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\). The Fourier transform of this modified function centers around a new frequency \\\\( \\\\omega + \\\\theta \\\\), thus altering the original frequency spectrum which was centered around \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the function g(t) to z(t) at time t1 introduces a phase shift, which affects the frequency spectrum when the Fourier transform is applied for t > t1."
