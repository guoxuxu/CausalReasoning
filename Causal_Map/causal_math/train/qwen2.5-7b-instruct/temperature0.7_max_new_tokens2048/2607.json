  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We analyze the system's behavior under the transformation \\\\( g(x) = Mx \\\\) for a matrix M.\n\nIf a further altering transformation \\\\( h(x) = Nx \\\\) (where N is another matrix) is applied at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\< T \\\\), does the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) purely depend on D?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( h(x) = Nx \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\< T \\\\) introduces additional dynamics into the system. The final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) will also depend on how N interacts with D, in addition to any earlier effects from M. Therefore, \\\\( x(T) \\\\) will not depend solely on D.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
