  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\omega\\\\) is a fixed frequency. The effect of an integral transformation \\\\(T[f](s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt\\\\) is examined over this function, both with and without additional transformations.\n\nIf the function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) evolves over time without any transformation and then undergoes the integral transformation \\\\(T[z](s)\\\\), would the result be affected merely by the passage of time (i.e., changes in \\\\(t\\\\) independent from \\\\(s\\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\(T[z](s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} e^{i\\omega t} dt\\\\) results in \\\\(\\\\frac{1}{s - i\\omega}\\\\), which is independent of the untransformed progression of time. Therefore, time itself does not affect the result of the transformation, as it is inherently accounted for in the integrand's structure.",
