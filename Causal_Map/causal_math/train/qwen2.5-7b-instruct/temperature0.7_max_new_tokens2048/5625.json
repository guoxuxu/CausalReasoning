  "Problem": "Analyze a controlled system defined by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_{t} + cu_{x} = 0\\\\), where c is a constant speed of wave propagation. A transformation is considered, defined by \\\\( g(u) = U(x,t) \\\\) where U is an integrating factor related to u, potentially altering the system dynamics.\n\nIf a transformation \\\\( g(u) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) at t = 0 and the system is then allowed to evolve according to the given PDE without further intervention, does \\\\( U(x,T) \\\\) at t = T remain unaltered as compared to simply evolving \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) to t = T under the untransformed equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( g(u) \\\\) alters the dynamics since \\\\( U(x,t) \\\\) introduces new factors into the PDE. Depending on the nature of U relative to u, the solution at t = T would reflect these changes, leading to an altered state from what would have been achieved with the original untransformed PDE.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation g(u) results in U(x,t), which then evolves according to the PDE to become u(x,t+Δt). The initial function u(x,0) evolves to u(x,t+Δt) under the untransformed PDE. Whether U(x,T) remains unaltered compared to u(x,T) depends on the nature of g(u) and U(x,t)."
