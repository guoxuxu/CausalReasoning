  "Problem": "Evaluate the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) under the influence of Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing components of the complex signal over time t.\n\nIf an intervention is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) in the form of a Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) of a segment of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), will the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(T)) \\\\) for T > t_1 capture frequencies introduced only by the Laplace Transform and not those inherent in \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform will capture all frequencies present in the updated function post-intervention, including those inherent in the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\) along with any modifications introduced due to the Laplace Transform, due to the linearity and complete representation inherent in Fourier analysis.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The real part x(t) and imaginary part y(t) of z(t) determine its value. Applying a Laplace transform L(z(t_1)) to a segment of z(t) influences z(t), which in turn affects the Fourier transform F(z(T)) for T > t_1."
