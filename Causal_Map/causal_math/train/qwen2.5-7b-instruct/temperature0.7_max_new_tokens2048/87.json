  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the wave equation \\\\( u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is the wave speed. We investigate the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx}u(x,t)dx \\\\) on the system and manipulating the transformed function.\n\nIf the transformed function \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) \\\\) is modified at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by a function \\\\( g(k) \\\\) (for example, a filter applied in the frequency domain), will the final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) reflect only the effects of the initial conditions modified by \\\\( g(k) \\\\) and not any inherent properties of the wave equation?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( g(k) \\\\) modifies the frequency components of the wave, but the evolution of these components still depends on the wave equation itself, particularly how these components propagate and interfere according to the wave speed \\\\( c \\\\). The final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) is therefore dependent both on the intervention and the dynamics dictated by the wave equation.",
