  "Problem": "Analyze the system governed by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We examine the role of applying the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), which transforms the spatial variable to a frequency variable.\n\nIf we apply an additional operator transformation (e.g., a Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\)) at time \\\\(t_1 > 0\\\\), will the state \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) for T > t_1 only depend on the original differential operator L?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing another transformation like the Laplace transform modifies the system dynamics in a fundamentally different space (from frequency domain to complex frequency domain). This new transformation adds complexity to the system dynamics that depend on the properties of both the Fourier transform and the Laplace transform, hence the final state at time T will inherently also depend on these transformations, not solely on L.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "u(x, t) → u(x, T); L → \\(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}\\); Fourier transform (\\(\\mathcal{F}\\)) → frequency variable; Laplace transform (\\(\\mathcal{L}\\)) → transformed function",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Fourier transform converts u(x, t) to its frequency representation, while applying the Laplace transform at time t_1 > 0 converts the temporal dynamics to a frequency domain representation. The state u(x, T) for T > t_1 depends on the combined effect of the original differential operator L and the Laplace transform."
