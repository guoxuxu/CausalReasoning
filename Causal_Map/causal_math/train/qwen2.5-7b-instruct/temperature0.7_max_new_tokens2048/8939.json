  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( u_{t} + a u_{x} = 0 \\\\) where a is a constant. Let's explore the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x,t)) \\\\) on this equation over time.\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) a filtering operation given by multiplication with \\\\( e^{-b\\\\xi^2} \\\\) (where b is a constant) is applied to \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, t_1) \\\\), will the behavior of \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be independent of a?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the amplitude of frequency components differently, but due to the linear dependency of the original equation on the parameter a, the evolution character still depends on a. The decay or growth of each component in the frequency domain remains influenced by a.",
