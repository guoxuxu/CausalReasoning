  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\) where C is a constant matrix. We examine the implications of a functional transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) applied at time t, where D is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), and knowing that the system operates under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\), can we accurately trace back to determine whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "If both D and C are unknown, determining whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied initially by just observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is challenging, as \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) may configure the initial state in different possible ways. Without explicit information on matrix D, multiple configurations could theoretically result in the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
