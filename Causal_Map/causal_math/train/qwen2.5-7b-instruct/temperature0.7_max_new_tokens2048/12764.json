  "Problem": "Consider the linear transformation \\( T: \\mathbb{C}^n \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}^n \\) represented by matrix \\( M \\), and its impact on a complex function \\( z(t) \\) defined by \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}v \\), where \\( v \\) is a constant vector in \\( \\mathbb{C}^n \\) and \\( \\omega \\) a real number. We explore how the application of Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{z(t)\\} \\) and its subsequent inverse alter the original function.\n\nIf \\( T \\) is applied to vector \\( v \\) at t = 0, transforming it to \\( Mv \\), and \\( z(t) \\) is computed without further intervention, will the resulting function at any t > 0 be the same when the transformation does not apply?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\( T \\) alters the vector \\( v \\) to \\( Mv \\) resulting in a new function \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}Mv \\). This is not equal to the original \\( e^{i \\omega t}v \\) unless \\( M \\) is a scalar matrix proportional to the identity, therefore influencing how the function evolves over time.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation T applied to vector v at t=0 results in Mv, which influences z(t) = e^(iωt)v. Applying the Laplace transform L to z(t) yields Z(s), and applying the inverse Laplace transform L^(-1) to Z(s) recovers z(t) without further change, assuming no additional transformations are applied between t=0 and t>0."
