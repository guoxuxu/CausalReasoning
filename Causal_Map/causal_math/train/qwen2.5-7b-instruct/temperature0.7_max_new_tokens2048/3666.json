  "Problem": "We are studying a complex function \\\\( z = f(x+iy) \\\\) where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are real numbers, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The function \\\\( f \\\\) is defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant complex matrix. We explore how transformations such as \\\\( g(z) = z + B \\\\) (with B as a constant complex matrix) affect the output of \\\\( f \\\\).\n\nGiven the position of \\\\( f(z(t)) \\\\) at some later time \\\\( t \\\\), can we determine the specific initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) if we do not know whether transformation \\\\( g \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), it is impossible to determine if the output at \\\\( t \\\\) originated from the transformed input \\\\( z_0 + B \\\\) or the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The influence of \\\\( B \\\\) might have permanently altered the path of \\\\( f \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
