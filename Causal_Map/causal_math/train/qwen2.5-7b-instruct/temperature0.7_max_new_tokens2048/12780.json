  "Problem": "Imagine analyzing the influence on a solution space by the operator \\\\( T: V \\\\rightarrow V \\\\) in the context of linear algebra, where T is defined as \\\\( T(x) = Ax \\\\) for a matrix A and S is a linear subspace of V which is invariant under T. Consider the subsequent application of a transformation \\\\( f(x) = Bx \\\\), where B is another matrix, to an initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) in S.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is applied to vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) in S, then allowing it to evolve under T without further intervention, will the outcome at time t = T (considering the repeated action of T here as iterative applications) stay within the subspace S?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( f(x) = Bx \\\\) potentially moves the vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) out of the invariant subspace S unless B specifically maps S onto itself or into another subspace that is also invariant under T. Thus without these specific conditions, the iterative application of T on \\\\( Bx_0 \\\\) will not necessarily keep the vector within S.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation T to a vector x' in the invariant subspace S results in another vector z that remains in S, and applying f to x_0 in S produces y which also stays in S."
