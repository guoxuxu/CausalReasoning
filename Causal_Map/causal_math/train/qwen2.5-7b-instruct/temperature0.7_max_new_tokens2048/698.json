  "Problem": "Consider a continuous-time Markov chain with state transition rates described by the matrix \\\\(Q\\\\). We examine the transformation effect of the matrix exponential \\\\(P(t) = e^{Qt}\\\\) on the probability distribution vector \\\\(\\\\pi(0)\\\\) over time t.\n\nCan we deduce the original probability distribution vector \\\\(\\\\pi(0)\\\\) after observing \\\\(\\\\pi(T)\\\\) at t = T without knowing the properties of \\\\(Q\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific knowledge about the matrix \\\\(Q\\\\), one cannot accurately reverse the evolution process to recover \\\\(\\\\pi(0)\\\\) from \\\\(\\\\pi(T)\\\\). The transformation involves exponential functions of \\\\(Q\\\\) which are irreversible without prior knowledge of \\\\(Q\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The probability distribution vector π(T) at time T is influenced by the original probability distribution vector π(0) through the matrix exponential P(t) which depends on the transition rate matrix Q."
