  "Problem": "Consider an electrical RLC circuit (Resistor (R), Inductor (L), and Capacitor (C)) in series. The governing differential equation is \\\\(L \\\\frac{d^2 q}{dt^2} + R \\\\frac{dq}{dt} + \\\\frac{q}{C} = 0\\\\), describing the charge \\\\(q\\\\) on the capacitor over time. We are interested in the effects of applying a Laplace transform to this equation, denoted as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\).\n\nKnowing the transformed solution \\\\(Q(s)\\\\) in the Laplace domain, can we uniquely determine the time-domain behavior of \\\\(q(t)\\\\) without knowing the specific parameters of the RLC circuit?",
  "Explanation": "The specific time-domain behavior of \\\\(q(t)\\\\) relies critically on the parameters R, L, and C of the circuit. While the Laplace transform \\\\(Q(s)\\\\) provides a general solution, without knowing these parameters, we cannot uniquely recover the exact functional form of \\\\(q(t)\\\\) or the specific behavior of the circuit.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
