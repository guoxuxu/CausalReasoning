  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively. A transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( C \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nFrom observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we deduce the initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information regarding the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it is impossible to accurately trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) due to the potential modification caused by the exponential factor \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) which alters magnitude and phase in a non-trivial way.",
