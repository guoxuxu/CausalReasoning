  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(w) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}w(t)\\\\,dt \\\\), known as the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( w(t) \\\\). This transformation modifies how we analyze the behavior of signals and systems in engineering and physics.\n\nKnowing the final Laplace transform \\\\( z(w'') \\\\), can we precisely investigate and determine the specific transformations used (whether \\\\( h(t) \\\\), \\\\( f(t) \\\\), or both) at all times, solely based on the value of \\\\( z(w'') \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple sequences or types of transformations leading to the same function \\\\( w''(t) \\\\) might result in the same Laplace transform \\\\( z(w'') \\\\). The method does not allow for clear deducing of the sequence or nature of transformations unless additional constraints or information is provided.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
