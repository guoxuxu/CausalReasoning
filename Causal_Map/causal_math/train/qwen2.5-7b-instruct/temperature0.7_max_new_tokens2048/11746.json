  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model that describes the diffusion of a pollutant in a river, represented by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial c}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 c}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\) where c is the concentration of the pollutant and D is the diffusion coefficient.\n\nIf a clean-up effort using a chemical agent that neutralizes the pollutant is introduced at time t_1 > 0, will the concentration of the pollutant at time T be independent of the changes in diffusion coefficient D?",
  "Explanation": "The effectiveness of the clean-up intervention potentially depends on the diffusion coefficient because D influences how quickly and widely the pollutant spreads before it can be neutralized. Higher diffusion could lead to larger areas needing intervention or different dynamics in neutralization.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The diffusion coefficient D, time t, the introduction of the chemical agent at t_1, and time T all influence the concentration c of the pollutant."
