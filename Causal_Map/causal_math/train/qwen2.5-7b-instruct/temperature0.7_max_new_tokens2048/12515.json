  "Problem": "Consider the process of solving a system of linear equations encoded by matrix operations. Let \\\\( Ax = b \\\\) represent the system with matrix A and vector b. Consider the impact of pre-multiplying both sides by a matrix \\\\( M \\\\) (where M is an invertible matrix).\n\nGiven the solutions to the transformed systems \\\\( M(Ax) = Mb \\\\) and \\\\( N(Ax) = Nb \\\\), can we deduce the specific matrices M and N used, solely based on the consistency of the solution with \\\\( Ax = b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the transformations using M and N do not change the solution \\\\( x \\\\), multiple different matrices M and N can lead to the same result if they are invertible. Thus, solely from solution consistency, the specific matrices M and N cannot be uniquely determined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Pre-multiplying both sides of the equation \\(Ax = b\\) by an invertible matrix \\(M\\) results in the equation \\(M(Ax) = Mb\\), which simplifies back to \\(Ax = b\\); similarly, pre-multiplying by another invertible matrix \\(N\\) results in \\(N(Ax) = Nb\\), which also simplifies back to \\(Ax = b\\)."
