  "Problem": "Analyze a signal processing system where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed by a Fourier transform, subjected to a filter \\\\( H(s) \\\\), and then converted back using the inverse Fourier transform. Let's denote the output signal as \\\\( y(t) = \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}(H(s) \\\\mathcal{F}(x(t))) \\\\).\n\nIf another filtering process \\\\( G(s) \\\\) is applied to the signal at a certain time before applying \\\\( H(s) \\\\), will the output signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\) remain unchanged compared to a scenario with only \\\\( H(s) \\\\) applied?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing an additional filter \\\\( G(s) \\\\) modifies the frequency components of the signal before it is further processed by \\\\( H(s) \\\\). This additional transformation alters the spectrum of the signal, thus changing the resultant output signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\), dependent on both \\\\( G(s) \\\\) and \\\\( H(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
