  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex plane as \\\\( f(z) = e^{Kz} \\\\), where K is a complex constant matrix. We investigate how the function affects solutions to the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dz}w = Mw \\\\), where M is another complex constant matrix.\n\nGiven the final vector \\\\( w(Z) \\\\), can we determine which transformations were applied (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) only by knowing the value of \\\\( w(Z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complex interactions between the non-commutative properties of \\\\( e^{Kz} \\\\), \\\\( e^{Cz} \\\\), and the solution to the differential equation, multiple transformation combinations (involving K, C, or both, applied at various z values) could yield the same \\\\( w(Z) \\\\). The presence of these interactions makes it impossible to distinguish and accurately determine which transformation happened only from the final state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function f(z) = e^(Kz) and g(z) transform the initial conditions of the differential equation to produce w(Z), and knowing w(Z) alone does not uniquely determine which specific transformation(s) (f(z) or g(z)) was/were applied."
