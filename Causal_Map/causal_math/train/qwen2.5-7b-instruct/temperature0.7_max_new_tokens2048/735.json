  "Problem": "Consider the system defined by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t represents time. We study the implications of applying a transformation denoted by \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) on this system dynamics.\n\nIf, at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\< T \\\\), an intervention applying \\\\( g(z) = z^3 \\\\) is introduced, will the outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be independent of the previous transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be significantly affected by the prior transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\), as each transformation modifies the system's state in a unique way. The cubic intervention further alters trajectory by tripling the angle and affecting the amplitude, thus making the final outcome dependent not only on the original dynamics but also on all intervening transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying f(z) = z^2 or g(z) = z^3 at time t1 will both transform z into z^2 or z^3 respectively, and since z(T) depends directly on the value of z at t1 after any transformation, z(T) will depend on whether f(z) or g(z) was applied."
