  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) in a two-dimensional region. An external source modifies the boundary conditions at specific points through a function represented by \\\\(v(x, y) = e^{i\\\\omega(x+y)}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the solution \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) is observed within the region at a later time t, can we infer that \\\\(v(x, y)\\\\) was the specific function applied at the boundary?",
  "Explanation": "Observing \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) inside the region does not uniquely specify \\\\(v(x, y)\\\\) due to the potential for multiple boundary conditions leading to similar solutions within the region, compounded by the fact that the Laplace equation does not inherently encode the time or exact nature of boundary changes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
