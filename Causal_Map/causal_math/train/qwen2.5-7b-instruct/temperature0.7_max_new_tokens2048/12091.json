  "Problem": "Let's consider a function space where functions are defined as \\\\( h(x) = e^{Ax} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix and \\\\( x \\\\) is a real number. We explore the effects of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) on these functions across variable \\\\( s \\\\).\n\nCan the original configuration of \\\\( A \\\\) in \\\\( h(x) \\\\), any intervention \\\\( g(x) \\\\), or the absence thereof be precisely identified from the Laplace transform output \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the original matrix \\\\( A \\\\), or identifying the particular function \\\\( g \\\\) used, based on the Laplace transform output alone is impractical without additional constraints or information. The transformation output could potentially result from various configurations of \\\\( A \\\\) and different forms of interventions overlapping in the transform domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The original configuration of A in h(x), the presence or intervention of g(x), and the absence thereof can each influence the Laplace transform output. Specifically, A directly influences h(x) and consequently the Laplace transform output; g(x) directly influences h(x), which in turn affects the Laplace transform output."
