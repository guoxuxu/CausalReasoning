  "Problem": "Consider a function space transformation governed by integral transform \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) represents a function in time domain and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable. Analyze the effect of applying the inverse Laplace transformation on \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and compare it under different variations of function \\\\( f(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{(s-c)^2} \\\\), can we ascertain whether a modification by \\\\( g(t) = e^{ct} \\\\) was applied to some original \\\\( f(t) \\\\), solely based on the functional form of \\\\( F(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{(s-c)^2} \\\\) suggests a form like \\\\( t e^{ct} \\\\), multiple original functions \\\\( f(t) \\\\), when similarly modified by exponential terms involving different constants, could yield the same form in \\\\( F(s) \\\\). Thus, additional information about initial conditions or the nature of interventions is required.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the inverse Laplace transformation to F(s) = 1 / (s - c)^2 suggests that the original function f(t) was modified by g(t) = e^(ct), as the transformation implies a shift in the time domain."
