  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We investigate the effect of an integral transform \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} K(x, s) u(s, t) ds \\\\) on the solution u(x, t), with K being a kernel function.\n\nAfter observing the state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at time T, can we deduce the original state \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) without knowledge about whether the transform \\\\( T(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if \\\\( T(u) \\\\) was applied, and lacking details of K, the inverse problem cannot be uniquely solved as the transformation can significantly alter the initial conditions in a non-reversible manner, especially if the kernel K and operator L do not allow simple back-calculation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
