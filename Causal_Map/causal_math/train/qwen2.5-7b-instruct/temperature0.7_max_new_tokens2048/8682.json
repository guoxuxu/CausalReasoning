  "Problem": "Consider a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\{ f(x) \\\\} = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(x) e^{-i \\\\omega x} \\\\, dx \\\\) and its inverse transform applied to a signal \\\\( f(x) \\\\). This approach is used to analyze the modifications in the signal spectrum when multiplied by a Gaussian, \\\\( g(x) = e^{-ax^2} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nGiven the spectrum after transformation, can we infer whether the signal was originally multiplied by \\\\( g(x) \\\\) without any prior knowledge?",
  "Explanation": "Without prior information about the multiplication with \\\\( g(x) \\\\), the changes in the spectrum could be attributed to different causes such as environmental noise or initial signal conditions, since many modifications could yield similar spectral changes.",
