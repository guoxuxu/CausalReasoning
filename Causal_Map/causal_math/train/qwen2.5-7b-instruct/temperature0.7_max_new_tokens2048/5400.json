  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\) where P is a constant matrix. The effect of applying a transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) over time t, with Q also being a constant matrix, is investigated.\n\nKnowing the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine exactly which transformations (\\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both) were used based solely on the information of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the potential for overlapping effects from the non-commutative properties of the exponential matrices and multiple possible paths leading to the same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), it is not feasible to definitively identify what transformations were applied. The effect of one can mask or mimic the other, leading to ambiguity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z at time T is determined by the initial value of z, the differential equation governing z, and the transformation applied over time. Specifically, P influences the rate of change of z, Q defines the transformation h(z), and t progresses z from its initial state to the final state z(T)."
