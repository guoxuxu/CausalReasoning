  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) where A is a real constant and t is time. We will analyze scenarios pertaining to a Laplace transformation defined by the integral transform \\\\( L[z(t)](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex constant.\n\nIf the Laplace transform \\\\( L[z(t)](s) \\\\) is computed for \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\), will the transform result depend uniquely on the parameter A?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( e^{iAt} \\\\), given by \\\\( L[z(t)](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} e^{iAt} dt \\\\), simplifies to \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - iA} \\\\) under the conditions where Re(s) > 0. This result is uniquely determined by A, showing a direct dependency on the parameter A.",
