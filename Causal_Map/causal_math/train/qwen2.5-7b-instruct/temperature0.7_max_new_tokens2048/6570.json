  "Problem": "In a complex function framework, consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant. We examine the effects of applying a linear transformation \\\\( z \\mapsto Az \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a non-zero complex constant, and the implications of further transformations.\n\nGiven an observation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( z \\mapsto Az \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of transformation \\\\( A \\\\), the observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could originate from various initial conditions due to the scaling and phase altering properties of \\\\( A \\\\). Consequently, the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is uncertain without knowing whether \\\\( A \\\\) was involved.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
