  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) that evolves over time according to the differential equation \\\\( \\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix. We analyze the potential effects of an integral transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(z) = \\int_0^t e^{St}z(s) ds \\\\), where S is another constant complex matrix.\n\nGiven the trajectory of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) observed at time T, is it possible to deduce precisely the initial function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied from t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), which modifies the initial state and integrates the evolving function over time, it is impossible to retroactively determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) since multiple initial conditions could lead to the same observed state at T, affected by the integral operation.",
