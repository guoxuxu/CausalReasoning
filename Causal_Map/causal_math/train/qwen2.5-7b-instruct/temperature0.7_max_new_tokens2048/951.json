  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function defined as \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\) where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant and \\( z_0 \\) is the initial complex number. We consider the impact of an integral transformation \\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\alpha s}z(s) \\, ds \\) applied to \\( z \\), where \\( \\alpha \\) is a real constant.\n\nIf a new transformation \\( S(z) = \\int_0^t e^{-i\\beta s}z(s) \\, ds \\) (where \\( \\beta \\) is a real constant) is introduced at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), will the outcome at \\( T \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depend solely on \\( \\omega \\) and not on \\( \\alpha \\) or \\( \\beta \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\( S(z) \\) affects the outcome at \\( T \\) by adding a competing or modifying exponential factor. Thus, the result would not solely depend on \\( \\omega \\) but also on the interaction and integration involving \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\beta \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "T(z) → z(t); S(z) → z(t); ω → z(t); α → z(t); β → z(t)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z(t) depends on ω through the exponential term e^(iωt), and is influenced by α and β through the transformations T(z) and S(z) respectively, but the outcome of T for T > t1 does not depend solely on ω and not on α or β."
