  "Problem": "Analyze a stochastic process where \\\\( X(t) \\\\) evolves according to the stochastic differential equation \\\\( dX = AX dt + BX dW \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constant matrices, and \\\\( dW \\\\) represents the differential of a Wiener process. Consider the effect of the transformation \\\\( f(X) = e^{CX} \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( X(T) \\\\), can we definitively determine what interventions (whether \\\\( f(X) \\\\), \\\\( g(X) \\\\), or both) were used, merely by examining the value of \\\\( X(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The stochastic elements and the nonlinear transformations make it impractical to reconstruct the exact sequence or types of interventions based merely on the endpoint \\\\( X(T) \\\\). Multiple intervention strategies could lead to statistically similar conclusions at time T due to the overlapping effects of the matrices and the randomness introduced by the Wiener process.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "A, B, and W directly cause changes in X over time, which eventually lead to X(T). C directly causes the transformation f(X)."
