  "Problem": "Let's analyze a discrete system defined using the eigenvalues \\\\( \\\\lambda_i \\\\) of a matrix A. Consider a complex function, \\\\( h(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z - \\\\lambda_i} \\\\), applied to each eigenvalue and its effects on solving the integral, \\\\( \\\\int_{C} \\\\frac{f(z)}{z - \\\\lambda_i} dz \\\\) where C is a contour encompassing all eigenvalues.\n\nIf a scaling matrix S is introduced as an intervention at time t2, modifying the eigenvalues to \\\\( S\\\\lambda_iS^{-1} \\\\), does the initial set of eigenvalues \\\\( \\\\lambda_i \\\\) still influence the outcomes of the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at time t > t2?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with S simply conjugates the eigenvalues but retains their essential characteristics within the spectrum of matrix A modified by S. Consequently, the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at any later time still reflects these adjusted but essentially derived eigenvalues, hence maintaining influence from the initial \\\\( \\\\lambda_i \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
