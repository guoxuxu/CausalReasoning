  "Problem": "Consider a continuous system described by Laplace's equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) in a two-dimensional domain. We analyze the effect of an integral transform, specifically the Fourier transform, applied to the boundary conditions of the domain.\n\nIf the Fourier transform is applied to the initial boundary conditions and then the system is allowed to evolve under Laplace's equation without further intervention, will the potential function \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\) within the domain at a later time still satisfy Laplace’s equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform to the boundary conditions does not alter the form of Laplace's equation, which remains valid as a description of the potential function within the domain. The Fourier transform only changes the representation of the boundary values without affecting the harmonicity of the potential function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
