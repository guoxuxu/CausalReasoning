  "Problem": "We consider a quantum system where the wave function \\\\( \\\\psi(x, t) \\\\) evolves according to the Schrödinger equation with a potential function \\\\( V(x) \\\\). We study the effect of a measurement operator \\\\( M \\\\) applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) defined as \\\\( M \\\\psi(x, t_1) = e^{-iH\\\\tau}\\\\psi(x, t_1) \\\\) where \\\\( H \\\\) is the Hamiltonian of the system and \\\\( \\\\tau \\\\) is a measurement time interval.\n\nIf the system state \\\\( \\\\psi(x, 0) \\\\) is evolved to \\\\( t = t_1 \\\\) under the Schrödinger equation, and then allowed to continue naturally until time \\\\( t = T \\\\) without the application of \\\\( M \\\\), will the state \\\\( \\\\psi(x, T) \\\\) be the same as if the measurement operator was applied at \\\\( t_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the measurement operator \\\\( M \\\\) changes the state of the system at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by altering the phase and probabilities of different components according to the Hamiltonian. This change in state would lead to a different evolution path post-\\\\( t_1 \\\\), resulting in a different state at time \\\\( T \\\\).",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The potential function V(x) and Hamiltonian H determine the evolution of the wave function ψ(x, t). The initial state ψ(x, 0) evolves to ψ(x, t_1) under the Schrödinger equation. Applying the measurement operator M at t_1 results in a new state ψ'(x, t_1), which then evolves to ψ'(x, T) without further intervention, differing from the natural evolution of ψ(x, t_1) to ψ(x, T)."
