  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\), where D is a constant matrix. We investigate the effect of applying a transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(x) = K(t)x \\\\) over time t, where K(t) is a time-dependent matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 from the observed state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied, the modified initial condition due to K(t) could not be reversed or accurately inferred just by observing the terminal state, especially without information about the characteristics of K relative to D.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
