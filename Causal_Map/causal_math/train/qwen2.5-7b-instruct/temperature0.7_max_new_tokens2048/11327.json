  "Problem": "Consider the scenario where a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves in the complex plane under the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We study how the Fourier Transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t)) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\), affects our understanding of the system.\n\nIf an intervention alters \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by applying a phase shift \\\\( z(t) \\\\rightarrow z(t)e^{i\\\\theta} \\\\) at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the endpoint of the Fourier Transform of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention introduces a phase shift which affects the Fourier Transform output by adding a complex phase factor. The final state of the Fourier Transform will definitely depend on the value of \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) as well as \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), altering the amplitude and phase of the resulting frequency components.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "A phase shift θ applied to z(t) at time t1 changes z(t) which then influences the Fourier Transform ℱ(z(T)) of z(T) for T > t1. The value of ω affects the evolution of z(t) but does not directly influence the endpoint of ℱ(z(T)) when considering only the effect of the phase shift."
