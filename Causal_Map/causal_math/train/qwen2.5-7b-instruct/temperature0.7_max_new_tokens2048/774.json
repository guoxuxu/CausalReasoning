  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where we have a mapping \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), in which z is a complex variable, A is a real number, and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex value. The transformation applies to study the effect of rotations in the complex plane under different time transformations.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and the rotation operator \\\\( e^{iAT} \\\\), can we retrieve the exact initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing if any alteration in form occurred?",
  "Explanation": "The mapping is reversible as long as the rotation angle (AT) is known, allowing for a precise computation of \\\\( z_0 = e^{-iAT} z(T) \\\\), thus effectively retrieving the initial state from the final state under unaltered progression.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
