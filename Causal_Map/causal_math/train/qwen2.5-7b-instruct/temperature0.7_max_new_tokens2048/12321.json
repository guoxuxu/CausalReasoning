  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We introduce a transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sA}z(s) ds \\\\), where A is a constant matrix. This scenario examines the impact of this transformation on the system's behavior over time.\n\nCan we uniquely determine the initial function form or parameters \\\\( z(0) \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T without knowledge that \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing about the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), recovering the original parameters such as \\\\( z(0) \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is not feasible as the integration and matrix transformation introduce non-reversible changes to the function's state up to time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
