  "Problem": "Consider the heat equation \\\\( u_t - \\\\Delta u = 0 \\\\) in a region \\\\( \\\\Omega \\\\) and let \\\\( u(x,0) = u_0(x) \\\\) be the initial condition. We investigate the effects of applying a Fourier transform over the spatial variables, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\omega, t) \\), on the solution's behavior.\n\nKnowing the state \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at some later time T, can one distinctly ascertain whether an intervention \\\\( v(x,t) \\\\) occurred and what its form was throughout the particular interval from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T?",
  "Explanation": "The solution at time T represents an accumulation of influences from the initial state and any external interventions, without distinct markers from the intervention. Multiple potential forms of \\\\( v(x,t) \\\\) could lead to the same observed state at T due to the inherent diffusion and transformation properties of the heat equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The change in u over time (u_t) is caused by the Laplacian of u (Δu); the initial condition u_0(x) determines the initial state of u; an intervention v(x,t) can alter the state of u; and the start time t_1 influences the end time T."
