  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) passes through a series of transforms: firstly by Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), followed by a scaling function in the frequency domain \\\\( S(\\\\omega) \\\\), and then by inverse Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\). Analyze the impact of this transformation chain and its effect on the time-domain behavior of \\\\( x(t) \\\\).\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is applied to the signal after the Fourier transform but before the scaling, will the final signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\) be independent of the nature of this intervention, \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) directly affects the frequency spectrum of the signal before scaling, thus altering the final output after the inverse Fourier transform. The resultant signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\) will depend critically on the effects of \\\\( T \\\\) in the frequency domain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_map": "x(t) → F(x(t)); F(x(t)) → S(ω); S(ω) → F^(-1)(S(ω)); T(F(x(t))) → F(T(x(t))); F(T(x(t))) → S(ω); S(ω) → F^(-1)(S(ω))",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input signal x(t) undergoes a Fourier transform F to become F(x(t)), which is then scaled in the frequency domain by S(ω), resulting in S(ω). The scaled frequency domain representation is transformed back to the time domain by the inverse Fourier transform F^(-1) to produce the final signal F^(-1)(S(ω)). If an additional transformation T is applied between the Fourier transform and scaling, the final signal y(t) depends on the nature of T."
