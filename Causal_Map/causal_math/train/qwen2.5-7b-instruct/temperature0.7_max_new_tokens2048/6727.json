  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\) where \\\\( n \\\\) is a positive integer and \\\\( z \\\\) a complex number. A Fourier transform transformation \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) is applied to the transformed function, making it \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\). We will explore the implications of modifying the power \\\\( n \\\\) and the transformation's effect on \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( f(t) = t^n \\\\) to \\\\( f(t) = at^n \\\\) for some constant \\\\( a \\\\) before applying the Fourier transform, will the effect on \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) be solely determined by \\\\( n \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by scaling factor \\\\( a \\\\) affects the amplitude and potentially the spread of the transformed function. Both \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( n \\\\) influence the final form of \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\), thus the contributions are not determined by \\\\( n \\\\) alone.",
