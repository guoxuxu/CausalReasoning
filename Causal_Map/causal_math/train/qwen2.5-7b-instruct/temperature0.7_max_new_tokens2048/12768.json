  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the integral transformation \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) = t^2 \\\\) and s is a complex parameter. We explore the causal inference between varying the parameter s and its effect on the transformed function F(s).\n\nIf s is increased from a value of 1 to 2, without any intervention on the function f(t), will the transformed function \\\\( F(s) \\\\) decrease?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing s reduces the magnitude of \\\\( e^{-st} \\\\) for each t, thereby diminishing the value of the integral that defines \\\\( F(s) \\\\). Since \\\\( e^{-st} \\\\) suppresses contributions from larger t values more strongly when s increases, \\\\( F(s) \\\\) decreases.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
