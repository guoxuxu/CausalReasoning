  "Problem": "Examine a complex valued function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are governed by the system of differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), respectively. Here A and B are constant matrices. We consider the impact of the integral transform \\\\(F[z](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t)\\\\, dt\\\\), where s is a complex variable.\n\nIf the integral transform \\\\(F[z](s)\\\\) is applied to the functions \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) at \\\\(t = 0\\\\), and then the systems are allowed to evolve under their respective equations without further intervention, will \\\\(F[z](s)\\\\) at some s be the same as if the systems were directly evolved and then transformed?",
  "Explanation": "The linearity and time invariance of integral transforms and linear differential equations mean that applying the transform at the initial state (t=0) or after evolution yields the same result due to the properties of convolution in the Laplace transform domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of x(t) and y(t) over time, driven by A and B respectively, influences the value of F[z](s) through the integral transform. The initial conditions at t=0 affect the subsequent values of x(t) and y(t), which in turn shape F[z](s). Without further intervention, the direct evolution of the systems under A and B will yield different results compared to the transform applied at t=0."
