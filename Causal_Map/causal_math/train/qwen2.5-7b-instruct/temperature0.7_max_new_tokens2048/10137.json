  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit that involves a resistor (R) and an inductor (L) in series connected to an alternating current (AC) voltage source. The relationship between the current (I) and the voltage (V) across the circuit can be modeled using a differential equation \\\\( V - L\\\\frac{dI}{dt} - RI = 0 \\\\). We are also interested in the impact of a Laplace Transform on this differential equation.\n\nIf the voltage source V is suddenly switched from a constant voltage to a sinusoidal voltage at t = 0, and no further changes are made to the circuit, will the current I(t) necessarily stabilize at the same sinusoidal frequency as the voltage?",
  "Explanation": "Switching V to a sinusoidal input in a linear differential equation system leads to a steady-state response where the current I(t) must also oscillate sinusoidally at the same frequency due to the system's linearity and the sinusoidal steady-state response of linear circuits.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The voltage V and the inductance L directly cause the current I, while the resistance R and the rate of change of current dI/dt are also influenced by V. A sudden change in V to a sinusoidal waveform will cause I to oscillate with the same frequency."
