  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant, and \\( z_0 \\) is the initial complex state. We investigate the behavior under complex transformations such as \\( f(z) = e^{i\\theta}z \\), with \\( \\theta \\) being another real constant.\n\nIf at a specific time \\( t_1 \\), an intervention \\( g(z) = e^{i\\phi}z \\) (where \\( \\phi \\) is a constant) is applied, will the final state \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depend solely on \\( \\omega \\) and not on \\( \\theta \\) or \\( \\phi \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both transformations \\( f(z) \\) and \\( g(z) \\) introduce additional phase shifts \\( \\theta \\) and \\( \\phi \\) respectively, affecting the final state. The system's behavior becomes a composition of initial and interventional transformations, making \\( z(T) \\) dependent on \\( \\theta \\), \\( \\phi \\), as well as \\( \\omega \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The final state z(T) depends on ω through the initial condition z(t1) and the time interval [t1, T], but is independent of θ and φ due to the nature of the transformation applied."
