  "Problem": "Study the effect of a complex function \\\\( z \\mapsto e^{iz} \\\\) on a real variable \\\\( x \\\\) and its integration relating to the Fourier transform of a signal \\\\( s(t) \\), represented as \\\\( S(f) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} s(t) e^{-i2\\pi f t} dt. \\\\)\n\nFrom observing the altered Fourier transform \\\\( S'(f) \\\\), is it possible to confirm if the transformation \\\\( z \\mapsto e^{iz} \\\\) was applied on the input signal \\\\( s(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Knowledge of the transformed Fourier transform alone \\\\( S'(f) \\\\) without additional context does not confirm that \\\\( z \\mapsto e^{iz} \\\\) was applied, as other transformations could produce similarly altered spectral characteristics.",
