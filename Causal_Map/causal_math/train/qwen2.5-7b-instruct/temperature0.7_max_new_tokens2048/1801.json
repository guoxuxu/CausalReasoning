  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined as a complex exponential \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) which undergoes transformations under various operations mapped in a complex function space. The transformations are represented by the operators \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is defined as \\\\( Lz(t) = e^{kt}z(t) \\\\) for some real constant k, and \\\\( M \\\\) as \\\\( Mz(t) = e^{ht}z(t) \\\\) with h being another real constant.\n\nIf the operator \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and the system is allowed to evolve without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T be equivalent to the direct evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at T without the intervention of L?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( L \\\\) alters \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( e^{it} \\\\) to \\\\( e^{(i+k)t} \\\\). Hence, the trajectory changes fundamentally right from the start, leading to a different final state at time T, \\\\( e^{(i+k)T} \\\\) compared to \\\\( e^{iT} \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
