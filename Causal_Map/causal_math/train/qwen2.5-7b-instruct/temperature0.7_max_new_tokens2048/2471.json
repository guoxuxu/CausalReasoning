  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) that evolves over time following the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a complex constant matrix. Further, investigate the impact of applying the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\) at any given time t, where N is another complex constant matrix.\n\nAssuming that at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another function \\\\( k(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) (where Q is a distinct complex constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on M and not on N or Q?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( k(z) \\\\) applies a new modification via \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\), which further complicates the system’s dynamics along with the earlier application of \\\\( e^{Nt} \\\\). Thus, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on the interactions and individual effects of M, N, and Q, not just M alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The final state z(T) depends on M through its continuous evolution from t=0 to T, and is also influenced by the state z(t1) at the intervention time t1, which in turn is affected by both N and Q."
