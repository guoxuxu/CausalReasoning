  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution over a metal rod T(x,t) is governed by the heat equation \\\\(u_t = k u_{xx}\\\\), where k is the thermal diffusivity. We examine the impact of a temperature altering function \\\\(g(T) = T + e^{-\\lambda t}\\\\) applied at t = 0 and explore how this function affects the temperature evolution over time.\n\nIf \\\\(g(T)\\\\) is applied to the initial temperature distribution \\\\(T(x, 0)\\\\) and then allowed to evolve under the heat equation without further intervention, will \\\\(T(x,t)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\(T(x, 0)\\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\(g(T)\\\\) changes the initial temperature condition, introducing an exponential decay dependent on \\\\(\\lambda\\\\) and time t. Since the heat equation is sensitive to initial conditions, the resulting temperature distribution at any later time t=T will differ from the scenario where \\\\(T(x, 0)\\\\) was left to evolve under the heat equation alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of g(T) to the initial temperature T(x,0) changes the initial condition, which then evolves over time t under the influence of k (thermal diffusivity) to produce T(x,t). Without g(T), T(x,0) evolves directly under the heat equation to produce T(x,t). These two processes will yield different T(x,t) at t=T unless g(T) does not alter the initial condition."
