  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state. Investigate the system's behavior under the influence of a Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), applied and then reversed on the function.\n\nIf a function modification \\\\( h(z) \\\\), represented by another Laplace-related operation, is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the final observed state at T depend solely on the initial function application \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and the operational characteristics of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), not on \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of an intervention such as \\\\( h(z) \\\\) potentially alters the path of the function significantly. Despite the original dynamics being defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), the intervention modifies subsequent states, making \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on the nature and effect of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) as well.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state z_0 and the frequency ω determine the complex-valued function z(t). The operation h(z) applied at t_1 does not affect the final observed state z(T) at time T."
