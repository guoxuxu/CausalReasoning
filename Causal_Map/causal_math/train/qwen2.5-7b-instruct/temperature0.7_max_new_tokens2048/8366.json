  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\) where P is a constant complex matrix. The function undergoes an integral transformation defined as \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t)dt \\\\), where s is a complex variable.\n\nCan we recover the initial function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) after observing its integral transform \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(s) \\\\) without knowing the value of s?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transform \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(s) \\\\) involves an exponential function of s which obscures some information about z(t) due to the integration over all time. Without knowledge of the specific s used in the transform, the original function z(t) cannot be uniquely determined.",
