  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) subjected to a Fourier transform, which shifts the frequency domain representation. Analyze the effect of adding an exponential decay \\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\) where \\( \\alpha \\) is a positive constant.\n\nCan the original function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) be uniquely recovered from its Fourier transform after it has been modified by \\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The modification \\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\) alters the decay properties of the signal, reflected as changes in the frequency spectrum (broadened and shifted). Since Fourier transform of the modified signal does not retain unique inverse properties due to this decay factor, \\( z(t) \\) cannot be accurately recovered.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Adding an exponential decay \\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\) to the original function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) results in a modified function \\( modified_z(t) \\), which undergoes a Fourier transform to produce a transformed frequency domain representation. This transformation affects the recoverability of the original function."
