  "Problem": "Consider a continuous complex function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) governed by a differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{df}{dz} = izf(z) \\\\). We analyze the transformation of this function using a Fourier transform defined by \\\\( F(f)(s) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(z) e^{-isz} dz \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention \\\\( g(z) = z^2 f(z) \\\\) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the Fourier transform of the resultant function at a later time \\\\( t \\\\) solely depend on the original differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of multiplying by \\\\( z^2 \\\\) introduces a significant change in the behavior and the Fourier transform of the function. This polynomial modification affects both the scale and nature of the frequency components, in addition to the factors introduced by the differential equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Fourier transform of the function f(z) influences the Fourier transform of the function g(z), which is derived from f(z) through the differential equation and the intervention. The differential equation governing f(z) leads to changes in g(z) through the multiplication by \\(z^2\\), and these changes propagate to the Fourier transform of g(z)."
