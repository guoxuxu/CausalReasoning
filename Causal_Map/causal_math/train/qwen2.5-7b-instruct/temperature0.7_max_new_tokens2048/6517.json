  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az + B \\\\), where A and B are complex constants. We explore the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) influenced by an integral transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Ct'}z(t')dt' \\\\), where C is another complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied at time t = 0 to the function \\\\( z(0) \\\\), and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is evolved according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az + B \\\\) without any further intervention, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T be equivalent to its state if \\\\( f(z) \\\\) had not been applied and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was evolved normally?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the integral transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) alters the initial trajectory by integrating over a history of modified states influenced by the exponential factor \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\). Even though the function evolves under the same differential equation afterward, its initial altered state by \\\\( f \\\\) causes it to follow a different trajectory.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state z(0) directly influences the state z(t) which in turn determines the state z(T) at time T. Applying the integral transformation f(z) at t=0 modifies z(t), thus potentially changing the state z(T). Without applying f(z), z(t) evolves normally under the differential equation, leading to a different state z(T) compared to when f(z) is applied."
