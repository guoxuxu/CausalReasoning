  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{At}x \\\\) where C is a complex function of a vector \\\\( x \\\\), and A is a constant matrix. The evolution of the function over time illustrates how x migrates through the transformation dictated by \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) and complex modulation by C.\n\nIf an intervention with a new linear operator \\\\( D \\\\) applied at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) alters the dynamics to \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Az + Dz\\\\), will the system state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be independent of the function C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by the linear operator D adds to the complexity, but the system’s trajectory up to \\\\( t_1 \\\\) influenced by C still impacts the state at T. As such, \\\\( z(T) \\\\) undoubtedly depends on both C and D alongside A, due to their cumulative influence leading up to T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
