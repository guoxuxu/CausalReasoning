  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Kx\\\\), where K is a matrix. We examine the effect of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(x) = S^{-1}e^{Lt}Sx \\\\), where L is a diagonal matrix and S is an invertible matrix, over the time t.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention in the form of \\\\( h(x) = S^{-1}e^{Mt}Sx \\\\) (where M is another diagonal matrix) is applied, will the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on K and not on L or M?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(x) \\\\) introduces additional dynamic modifiers, making the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) contingent on both L and M, as well as K. The transformations via \\\\( S^{-1}e^{Lt}S \\\\) and \\\\( S^{-1}e^{Mt}S \\\\) add layers of complexity affecting the system's evolution and consequently influencing \\\\( x(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
