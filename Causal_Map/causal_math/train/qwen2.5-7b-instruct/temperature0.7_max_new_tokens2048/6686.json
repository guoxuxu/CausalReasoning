  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. We study the effect of differentiating this function and the subsequent application of a Fourier transform.\n\nIf given the Fourier transform of the differentiated function, can we determine the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any additional interventions or information?",
  "Explanation": "While we can infer the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) from the peak in the Fourier transform of the differentiated function, we cannot determine the exact form or any phase shift of the original function without knowing it was the exponential form \\\\( e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\). Multiple functions could share the same differentiated Fourier transform profile due to possible phase shifts and other transformations not influencing frequency magnitude.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The angular frequency ω determines the form of the function z(t). Differentiation of z(t) results in z'(t), and its Fourier transform corresponds to z(t) up to a scaling factor."
