  "Problem": "Consider a linear reaction-diffusion system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t = Du_{xx} + cu\\\\) on a domain [0, L] with Neumann boundary conditions, where D is a diffusion coefficient and c is a reaction term. We examine the impact of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int_{0}^{L} e^{-ikx} u(x, t) dx\\\\) applied to this system.\n\nGiven the value of \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) at time T, can we infer the initial condition \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) accurately without knowing the Fourier transform was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is invertible, and information about the initial state is preserved through the evolution under the PDE. Knowing \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\), one can apply the inverse Fourier transform and the properties of the linear PDE to reconstruct \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) precisely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "u(x, 0) → u(x, t); D → u_t; D → u_xx; c → u; u(x, t) → hat{u}(k, t); hat{u}(k, T) → u(x, t)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u(x, 0) directly influences u(x, t), the diffusion coefficient D directly affects both u_t and u_xx, the reaction term c directly impacts u, and u(x, t) is transformed into \\(\\hat{u}(k, t)\\); the value of \\(\\hat{u}(k, T)\\) indirectly provides information about u(x, t) but does not allow for accurate inference of u(x, 0) without additional information."
