  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant complex matrix. We evaluate the effect of performing a Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) given by \\\\( L\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = Z(s) \\\\), and analyze how transformations affect the function over time and complex frequency domain.\n\nAfter obtaining \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) from \\\\( L\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\), can we deduce the original differential equation parameters directly without knowing whether transformations other than \\\\( L \\\\) were applied?",
  "Explanation": "The original parameters of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) dictated by \\\\( M \\\\) are transformed into a different domain by \\\\( L \\\\). Without exact information on whether only \\\\( L \\\\) was applied, and without reverse transformations, the characteristics of \\\\( M \\\\) in the time domain can't be uniquely determined from \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The constant complex matrix M directly causes the rate of change of z(t) with respect to time; z(t) undergoes a Laplace transform to become Z(s); Z(s) is influenced by the Laplace transform of z(t); the value of M cannot be directly deduced from Z(s) without additional information."
