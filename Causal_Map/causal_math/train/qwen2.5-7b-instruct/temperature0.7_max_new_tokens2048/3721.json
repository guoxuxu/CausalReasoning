  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in the complex plane defined by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We evaluate the impact of a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) applied at t = 0, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to an initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) had been simply evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) alters the initial state from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} z_0 \\\\), impacting the entire trajectory of the solution. The subsequent evolution leads to a modified solution influenced by both \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), resulting in a state at t = T that differs from the simple evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation g(z) = e^(αt)z at t=0 changes the initial condition from z_0 to e^(α*0)z_0 = z_0, so the evolution of z(t) under dz/dt = iωz will be identical for both scenarios without further intervention."
