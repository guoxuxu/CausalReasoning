  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) applied to a periodic function \\\\( f(t) \\\\). Analyze how different types of interventions (applying a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) depending on a parameter matrix \\\\( P \\\\)) affect the transformed function \\\\( F(s) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is an undisturbed sine wave \\\\( f(t) = \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\) and transformed by \\\\( F(s) \\\\), will the Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) yield the same result in the absence of any intervention by operator \\\\( L \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "In absence of any intervention, the transformation \\\\( F(s) \\\\) applied directly to \\\\( f(t) = \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\) is straightforward and results in the well-known Laplace transform of a sine function, which is \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\omega}{s^2 + \\\\omega^2} \\\\). The absence of intervention means the input and the transformed output are directly related by this standard transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
