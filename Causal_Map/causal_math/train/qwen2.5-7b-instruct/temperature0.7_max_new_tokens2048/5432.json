  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature change \\\\( \\\\Delta T \\\\) in a body is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d\\\\Delta T}{dt} = -k\\\\Delta T \\\\), where k is a positive constant. We examine the effect of an external heating process described by \\\\( h(t) = e^{At}\\\\Delta T_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( \\\\Delta T_0 \\\\) is the initial temperature difference.\n\nGiven the final observed temperature difference \\\\( \\\\Delta T(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine which interventions were used (either \\\\( h(t) \\\\), \\\\( c(t) \\\\), or both), solely by knowing \\\\( \\\\Delta T(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( \\\\Delta T(T) \\\\) could result from varying sequences or magnitudes of the interventions due to the independent and possibly conflicting impacts of the exponential heating and cooling processes. This leads to multiple possible paths and interventions that could yield the same final temperature difference.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
