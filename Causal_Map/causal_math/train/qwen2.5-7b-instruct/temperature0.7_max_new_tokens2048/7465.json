  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, governed by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. The function is subjected to a Fourier Transform, defined by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is allowed to evolve under the differential equations without further intervention, will the Fourier Transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) be the same as if transformations on \\\\( x(t) \\\\) or \\\\( y(t) \\\\) were not applied?",
  "Explanation": "Allowing \\\\(z(t)\\\\) to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\) without intervention changes the forms of \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\), impacting the result of the Fourier Transform at any frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), due to the differential impact of A and B on their respective functions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of x(t) and y(t) under the differential equations influences z(t), which in turn determines the Fourier Transform F(z)(ω). The constants A and B governing x(t) and y(t) respectively also directly affect F(z)(ω). Therefore, if x(t) and y(t) evolve according to A and B without further intervention, the resulting Fourier Transform F(z)(ω) at frequency ω will reflect these changes."
