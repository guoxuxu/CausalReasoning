  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a control input that can be transformed using an integral transformation \\\\( u(t) = \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\\\{F(s)\\\\} \\\\), where \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is the Laplace transform of a new input function. We study how transformations of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) affect the system's behavior.\n\nGiven the end state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we ascertain exactly which transformations of the control input were applied (whether original, \\\\( G(s) \\\\), or the intervention \\\\( H(s) \\\\)), solely by observing \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Just knowing the end state does not uniquely identify which specific control transformations were applied through the system’s evolution. Multiple different sequences and types of input transformations can lead to the same or indistinguishably similar endpoint due to overlapping effects and inherent properties of linear systems.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The control input u(t) directly influences the system state x(T); the Laplace transform F(s) mediates between G(s) and H(s) and the control input u(t); G(s) and H(s) both contribute to determining F(s), which in turn affects the system state x(T)."
