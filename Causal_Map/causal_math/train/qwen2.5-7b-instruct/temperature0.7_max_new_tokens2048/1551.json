  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the temperature distribution over a rod of length L is governed by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where k is the thermal diffusivity. We explore the impact of an initial heat distribution described by \\\\( u(x, 0) = h(x) \\\\), a predefined function, and the influence of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{h}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega x}h(x) dx \\\\) on this distribution.\n\nIf a Fourier transform is applied as an intervention to modify the initial condition from \\\\( h(x) \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\hat{h}(\\\\omega) \\\\) at t = 0, will the ultimate temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) for t > 0 be affected by this transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying a Fourier transform as an intervention changes the initial condition of the system. Since the heat equation is sensitive to initial conditions, the resulting temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) will reflect the transformed initial state \\\\( \\\\hat{h}(\\\\omega) \\\\), thereby altering the system's behavior and the subsequent temperature profile.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial heat distribution h(x) directly influences the temperature distribution u(x, t) over time. Applying a Fourier transform to h(x) results in a modified initial condition h'(x), which in turn affects the temperature distribution u(x, t) for t > 0."
