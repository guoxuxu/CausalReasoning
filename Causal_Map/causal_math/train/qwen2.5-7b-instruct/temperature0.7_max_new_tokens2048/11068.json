  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the iterated integral transformation \\\\(\\mathcal{L}(f(x)) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}(\\int_0^t f(u) du) dt\\\\), where \\\\(f(x)\\\\) is a complex function. We examine the impact of modifying \\\\(f(x)\\\\) by a transformation \\\\(g(f(x)) = f(x) + ce^{dx}\\\\), where c and d are constants.\n\nCan we determine precisely which transformations (whether \\\\( g(f(x)) \\\\), \\\\( h(f(x)) \\\\), or both) were applied, based only on the final integral result \\\\( \\mathcal{L}(h(g(f(x)))) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions solely through the final result \\\\( \\mathcal{L}(h(g(f(x)))) \\\\) is challenging due to the overlapping effects of the exponential terms from both transformations. They both influence the integral result in a compound fashion, making it difficult to parse distinct contributions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying g(f(x)) and h(g(f(x))) both transform f(x) and affect the final integral result L(h(g(f(x)))), but it's unclear from the final result alone which specific transformations were applied."
