  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{At} \\) applied to a constant vector \\( v \\) in the complex plane, where \\( A \\) is a fixed complex matrix. This scenario studies the effect of the function and the impact of an applied integral transformation \\( g(z) = \\int_0^T e^{Bt}z(t)\\, dt \\), with \\( B \\) being another constant complex matrix.\n\nKnowing the transformation result \\( g(z) \\), can it be conclusively determined whether the function applied was \\( e^{At}v \\) or another function, assuming knowledge of \\( B \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Even with knowledge of \\( B \\) and the outcome \\( g(z) \\), the specific function form \\( e^{At}v \\) cannot be exclusively confirmed. Variations in \\( A \\) or the vector \\( v \\), under similar transformation properties, could yield the same \\( g(z) \\), especially without specific data on how B interacts with different potential \\( A \\) matrices.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function applied (e^(At)v) directly influences z(t), which then influences g(z). The matrix B directly influences g(z). Knowing g(z) and B allows us to trace back to z(t) but does not conclusively determine whether the original function was e^(At)v or another function."
