  "Problem": "Consider a differential equation describing heat transfer \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta u \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity and \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) is the Laplacian operator. We study the impact of applying a Fourier transform (denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\)) to the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\).\n\nGiven the temperature profile \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what transformations were used (whether \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) can potentially result from different transformation processes or be similarly affected by distinct combinations of transformations due to the nature of integral transforms influencing the solution in various and often overlapping manners.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial temperature distribution u(x, 0) directly influences the temperature profile u(x, T); applying either a Fourier transform (F) or a Laplace transform (L) to u(x, 0) can result in u(x, T), but knowing only u(x, T) is insufficient to determine precisely which transformation(s) were applied."
