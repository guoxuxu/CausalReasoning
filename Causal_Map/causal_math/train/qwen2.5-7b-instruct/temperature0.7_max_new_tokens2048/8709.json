  "Problem": "Consider a function space in which solutions to the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 f = 0 \\\\) are investigated, and let \\\\( g(x,y) = x^2 - y^2 \\\\) be a transformation applied to any function \\\\( f \\\\) in this space. Examine the impacts of applying another transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(f) = f + \\\\lambda xy \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( h(f) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( f_0(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 \\\\) and then this function is transformed by \\\\( g \\\\), will the resulting function at the end still satisfy the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 f = 0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\\\( h(f) \\\\) results in a function \\\\( f + \\\\lambda xy \\\\), which alters the harmonic nature of the function. While \\\\( x^2 + y^2 \\\\) is harmonic, the addition of \\\\( \\\\lambda xy \\\\) introduces terms that do not satisfy the Laplace equation upon transformation by \\\\( g \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation h to f_0 yields h(f_0), which is then transformed by g to produce g(h(f_0)). The resulting function g(h(f_0)) may or may not satisfy the Laplace equation ∇²f = 0."
