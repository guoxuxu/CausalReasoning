  "Problem": "Consider a complex function $z(t)$ defined by the integral transformation $z(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} e^{At} x(s) ds$, where $A$ is a constant complex matrix, and $x(t)$ is a vector function. We analyze the impact of an additional operation $f(z) = e^{Bt}z$ at time $t$, where $B$ is also a constant complex matrix.\n\nIf $f(z)$ is applied to $z(t)$ at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the transformation without further intervention, will $z(T)$ at t = T be the same as if $z(t)$ was directly calculated from $x(s)$ to t = T without applying $f(z)$?",
  "Explanation": "The application of $f(z)$ initially modifies $z(t)$ by $e^{Bt}$, which multiplies the entire integral by a complex exponential factor. This modification changes the trajectory of subsequent values, leading to different results at time T compared to direct computation from $x(t)$. The matrix exponentials do not generally commute, and their effects are not reversible or cancellable simply through the integral transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z(t) at time t is determined by the integral of x(s) from 0 to t. Applying f(z) at t=0 modifies z(t) to e^(Bt)z(t), which then evolves independently. Without applying f(z), z(T) at time T is directly calculated from x(s) to T."
