  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing a periodic signal in the complex plane. We explore the consequences of applying the Fourier transform \\\\( F \\), which converts it into its frequency domain representation.\n\nGiven that the dominant frequency in the Fourier transform is observed to be at \\\\( \\omega + \\beta \\\\), can we determine whether the signal was originally \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) and then modulated by \\\\( e^{i\\beta t} \\\\), or if the initial signal was different?",
  "Explanation": "The shift to \\\\( \\omega + \\beta \\\\) in the Fourier transform could result from various combinations of initial signals and modulations. The end frequency alone does not specify whether it originated from \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) modulated by \\\\( e^{i\\beta t} \\\\) or another configuration.",
