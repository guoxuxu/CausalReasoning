  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation of a function \\\\( f(x) = Ax \\\\), where A is a matrix applied to a vector field in \\\\( \\\\mathbb{R}^n \\\\). Let's analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{iBz} \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is the complex variable and B is another constant matrix, mapping real numbers to complex numbers.\n\nGiven the final state at \\\\( z = T \\\\) after applications of both \\\\( e^{iBz} \\\\) and a subsequent intervention \\\\( e^{iCz} \\\\), can we exactly determine the sequence or specificity of transformations applied?",
  "Explanation": "The final state at \\\\( z = T \\\\) might result from various combinations of interventions and transformations, including potential overlapping effects of B and C. The complexity and potential for different paths leading to the same endpoint render precise identification of the sequence or specific transformations challenging.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Matrix B and C both transform the complex variable z into g(z), and the value of z at time T determines the final state."
