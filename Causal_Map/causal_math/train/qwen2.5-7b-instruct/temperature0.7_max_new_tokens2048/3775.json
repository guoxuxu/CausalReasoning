  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\( U_{xx} = -\\\\lambda U \\\\) where \\\\( U(x, t) \\\\) is a function of space x and time t, and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant. Study the effects of applying a Fourier transform over space, resulting in the transformed function \\\\( \\\\hat{U}(k, t) \\\\), and analyze its behavior under the spatial transform \\\\( G(k) = e^{-\\\\alpha k^2 t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is another constant.\n\nIf at some intermediate time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the function \\\\( G(k) \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the solution \\\\( \\\\hat{U}(k, T) \\\\) at time T > t_1 be independent of the initial function \\\\( U(x, 0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( G(k) \\\\) modifies the intermediate state, adding an exponential damping based on \\\\( k \\\\), hence the ultimate solution \\\\( \\\\hat{U}(k, T) \\\\) still depends on the modified state, which in turn was dependent on the initial function. Therefore, \\\\( \\\\hat{U}(k, T) \\\\) reflects both the initial conditions and the effect of the intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The second derivative of U with respect to x (-λU) determines U, which transforms into U(k, t) via Fourier transform, then U(k, t) evolves under the intervention G(k) to become U(k, T). The application of G(k) at time t_1 influences U(k, T) but does not make it independent of the initial function U(x, 0)."
