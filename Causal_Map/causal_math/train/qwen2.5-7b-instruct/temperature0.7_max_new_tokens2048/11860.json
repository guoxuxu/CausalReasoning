  "Problem": "Consider a complex function given by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function is analyzed under the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\theta}z \\\\), with \\\\( \\theta \\\\) being a constant phase shift.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 = 1 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve according to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 = 1 \\\\) was directly evolved to T under \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition by adding a phase shift \\\\( \\theta \\\\). The evolution of this new initial condition under \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) results in a trajectory that is phase-shifted by \\\\( \\theta \\\\) compared to the unmodified trajectory, leading to \\\\( z(T) = e^{i\\omega T + i\\theta} \\\\), not \\\\( e^{i\\omega T} \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial value z_0 directly influences the state z(t) through the function z(t) = e^(iωt). Applying the transformation g(z_0) results in a new initial value that evolves to z(T) according to z(t) = e^(iωt). Without further intervention, z(T) after applying g(z_0) will not be the same as evolving z_0 directly to T under z(t)."
