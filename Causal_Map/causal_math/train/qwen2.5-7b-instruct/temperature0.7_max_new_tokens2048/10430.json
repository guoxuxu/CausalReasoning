  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t = Lu\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator. We are investigating the role of the integral transformation \\\\(T(u) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} u(t) \\, dt\\\\) applied to function \\\\(u(t)\\\\).\n\nCan we recover the original function \\\\(u(0)\\\\) uniquely from the Laplace transform \\\\(T(u)\\\\) after evolution under \\\\(u_t = Lu\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform, while invertible under ideal conditions, does not guarantee a unique inversion without additional information, particularly regarding the behavior imposed by \\\\(L\\\\) and initial/boundary conditions of \\\\(u(t)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace transform T(u) of the function u(t) depends on the linear differential operator L and the function u(t). The initial value u(0) influences the function u(t) which in turn affects its Laplace transform T(u)."
