  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dx} [u(x)] = M u(x) \\\\) where M is a linear operator. An operator transformation \\\\( T(u) = e^{Nx} u(x) \\\\) is introduced, with N being another linear operator. Analyze the influence of this transformation on the behavior of the function u(x) over the domain.\n\nIf at some point x_1, a new transformation \\\\( S(u) = e^{Kx}u(x) \\\\) (where K is a linear operator) is applied, will the system's behavior at \\\\( u(X) \\\\) for X > x_1 depend only on M and not N or K?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( S(u) \\\\) adds another layer of transformation, making the final state at \\\\( u(X) \\\\) dependent not only on M but also on N and K. The interactions between these operators can change the trajectory and endpoint significantly.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation T(u) = e^(Nx) u(x) affects the derivative of u(x), while applying S(u) = e^(Kx) u(x) modifies the value of u(x) at a future point X. The behavior of u(X) for X > x_1 depends on both M and the combined effect of N and K through their transformations."
