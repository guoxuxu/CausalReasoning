  "Problem": "Consider a function space defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\}(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\). We explore the implications of using an inverse Laplace transform \\\\( f(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{F(s)\\} \\\\) and applying a transformation \\\\( g(t) = tf(t) \\\\) in this space.\n\nGiven \\\\( G(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{g(t)\\}(s) \\) and knowing the corresponding Laplace transform property, can we uniquely reconstruct \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\\\( G(s) \\), and knowing that \\\\( G(s) = -F'(s) \\\\) by the property of the Laplace transform for \\\\( tf(t) \\\\), we can uniquely determine \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and thus \\\\( f(t) \\\\) by integration of \\\\( G(s) \\\\) and applying the inverse Laplace transform, assuming initial conditions are accounted for or zeroes.",
