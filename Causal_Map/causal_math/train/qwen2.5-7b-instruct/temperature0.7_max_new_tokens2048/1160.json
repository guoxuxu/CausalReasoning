  "Problem": "Consider a linear system characterized by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We explore how the application of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-ix\\\\xi} u(x,t) dx \\\\) affects the system.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi, T) \\\\), can we determine exactly what interventions (Fourier transform, Laplace transform, or both) were applied only by observing the function in the frequency domain at \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions based solely on the observed transformed function at T is impractical, as different combinations of transformations (pertaining to Fourier and Laplace) can lead to similar or even identical results in the frequency domain. This ambiguity prevents precise determination of the preceding interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
