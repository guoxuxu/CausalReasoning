  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant. We analyze the effect of the integral transform \\( g(z) = \\int e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt \\) where \\( s \\) is a complex number.\n\nIf \\( g(z) \\) is computed for a function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) from \\( t = 0 \\) to \\( t = \\infty \\), does this transformation preserve the frequency \\( \\omega \\) in the transformed domain?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transform \\( g(z) \\), specifically the Laplace transform in this context, converts the function into a frequency domain representation. However, the presence of \\( s \\) alters the frequency components, meaning \\( \\omega \\) is represented differently in the transform's output compared to the original domain.",
