  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. We explore the behavior of this function under the integral transformation \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_{0}^t f(s) ds \\\\).\n\nGiven the output after both transformations \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( K \\\\) at time T, is it possible to determine accurately which part of the behavior arises from \\\\( z(t) \\\\), from \\\\( T \\\\), and from \\\\( K \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The sequential application of \\\\( K \\\\) and then \\\\( T \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) creates a compounded transform whose individual components' effects are intertwined. The output reflects integrated changes not easily decomposable into contributions solely attributable to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), \\\\( T \\\\), or \\\\( K \\\\), especially without knowing the specific time of application and properties of each transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
