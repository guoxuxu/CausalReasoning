  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the Schrödinger equation with a potential function \\( V(x, t) \\), such that \\( i\\\\hbar\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\psi}{\\\\partial t} = -\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2\\\\psi}{\\\\partial x^2} + V(x,t)\\\\psi \\). We explore how applying a Fourier transform \\( \\\\mathcal{F}(\\\\psi(x, t)) \\\\) affects the wave function over time.\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), an intervention is applied changing the potential to \\( V'(x, t) \\), will the state \\( \\\\psi(x, T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depend only on the original potential \\( V(x, t) \\) and not on the Fourier transform or the new potential?",
  "Explanation": "The new potential \\( V'(x, t) \\) alters the Hamiltonian from time \\( t_1 \\) onwards, affecting how the state evolves irrespective of the earlier potential \\( V(x, t) \\) or the Fourier transform. This intervention leads to differing dynamics and resulting in a unique state \\( \\\\psi(x, T) \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
