  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), representing a complex oscillation on the unit circle in the complex plane. We analyze the impact of the Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), defined for any function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(g(t)) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}g(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nCan we uniquely identify the scaling factor \\\\( a \\\\) and the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) from the Laplace transform of the transformed \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for a known \\\\( s \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform, especially without constraining additional parameters, does not provide sufficient information to uniquely determine both the scaling factor and the frequency. Multiple combinations of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) might produce similar transformations for a given \\\\( s \\\\), making unique identification infeasible without further data.",
