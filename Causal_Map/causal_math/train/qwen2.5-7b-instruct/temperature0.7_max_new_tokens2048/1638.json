  "Problem": "Consider a system where the rate of heat transfer \\\\( Q(t) \\\\) in a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) represents the temperature distribution along the rod. A transformation \\\\( f(u) = u + h \\\\), where h is a constant heating term, is applied to the rod's temperature distribution.\n\nCan the original temperature distribution at t = 0 be uniquely determined after observing the temperature distribution at a later time t without knowing whether \\\\( f(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on whether the transformation \\\\( f(u) = u + h \\\\) was applied, the observed temperature distribution at time t could be a consequence of multiple initial distributions, affected either by the heat equation alone or modified by the constant h.",
