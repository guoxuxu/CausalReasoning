  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a vector function \\\\( z = h(x) \\\\) defined as \\\\( h(x) = \\\\int_0^T e^{At}x \\\\, dt \\\\) over a time period T, where A is a square matrix. We examine the changes induced by applying a transformation \\\\( g(x) = Dx \\\\), where D is a constant matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and allowed to evolve under the vector function \\\\( h(x) \\\\) without any further intervention, will the outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be the same as evolving \\\\( x_0 \\\\) under \\\\( h(x) \\\\) directly to T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( g(x) = Dx \\\\) before integrating alters the initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) to \\\\( Dx_0 \\\\). The integration process then accounts for this modified initial condition, changing the outcome to \\\\( \\\\int_0^T e^{At}Dx_0 \\\\, dt \\\\) which generally does not equal \\\\( \\\\int_0^T e^{At}x_0 \\\\, dt \\\\) unless D commutes with e^{At} for all t in [0, T].",
