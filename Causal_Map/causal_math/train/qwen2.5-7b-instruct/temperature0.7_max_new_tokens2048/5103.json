  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) describing heat distribution along a rod governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\) with constant diffusivity k. Investigate the implications of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} u(x, t)e^{-i\\\\omega x}dx \\\\) applied to this model.\n\nIf an intervention applies a filtering function \\\\( g(\\\\omega) \\\\) modifying \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, t) \\\\) at time t_1, will the solution at time T, \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, T) \\\\), be solely decided by the heat equation ignoring the effects of \\\\( g(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the filtering function \\\\( g(\\\\omega) \\\\) alters the spectral components of \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\), thereby changing the outcome \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, T) \\\\). Thus, \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, T) \\\\) depends not only on the heat equation but also critically on the filter applied, impacting diffusion characteristics across frequencies.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The temperature distribution u(x, t) influences its time derivative ∂u/∂t and second spatial derivative ∂²u/∂x² through the heat equation. Applying a filtering function g(ω) modifies the Fourier transform ū(ω, t) at time t_1, which then affects ū(ω, T) at time T. The solution ū(ω, T) is not solely determined by the heat equation without considering the effects of g(ω)."
