  "Problem": "Consider a two-dimensional system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{u} = M u\\\\), where M is a matrix giving the linear transformation on vector \\\\(u\\\\). We investigate the effects of applying a complex function transformation \\\\( g(u) = \\\\cos(\\\\omega t)u +\\\\sin(\\\\omega t)u \\\\), with a constant \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), over time interval t.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( h(u) = e^{Dt}u \\\\) (where D is another constant matrix) is introduced as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( u(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on M and not on \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) or D?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( u(T) \\\\) will be influenced by the initial complex function transformation \\\\( g(u) \\\\), as well as the new intervention \\\\( h(u) \\\\). The transformations introduced not only by M but also \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and D will collaboratively affect the trajectory and the final state of the system, making it dependent on all these factors.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
