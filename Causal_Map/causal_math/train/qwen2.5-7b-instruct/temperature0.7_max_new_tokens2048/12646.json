  "Problem": "Investigate the effect of impulse action in a heat equation \\\\( u_t - \\\\Delta u = 0 \\\\) on a domain \\\\( \\\\Omega \\\\), where \\\\( u_t \\\\) is the time derivative of u, and \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) is the Laplacian. The intervention is represented by applying a function \\\\( g(u) = u + h \\\\delta(x-x_0) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\), where \\\\( h \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\) is the Dirac delta function centered at \\\\( x_0 \\\\).\n\nAssuming an impulse is added at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\) and location \\\\( x_0 \\\\) as defined by \\\\( g(u) \\\\), does the final state \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) for T > \\\\( t_0 \\\\) solely depend on the form of the initial condition \\\\( u_0 \\\\) and not on \\\\( h \\\\) or \\\\( x_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "No, the impulse adds a singular source term at \\\\( t_0 \\\\) and \\\\( x_0 \\\\) which affects the solution thereafter. Consequently, the final state \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) depends on the initial state, the magnitude of the impulse \\\\( h \\\\), and its location \\\\( x_0 \\\\) as well as the properties of the diffusion defined by the Laplacian.",
