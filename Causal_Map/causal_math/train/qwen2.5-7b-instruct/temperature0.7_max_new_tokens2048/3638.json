  "Problem": "Consider a system where the position \\\\( x(t) \\\\) of a particle moving along a line is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = kx \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant coefficient. We examine the effect of the transformation \\\\( h(x) = x^2 \\\\) operated on the initial position \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and its impact over time t.\n\nGiven the position \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time T, can you deduce whether the initial position was squared before or during the evolution according to \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = kx \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional information or constraints, multiple initial conditions could lead to the same position at time \\\\( T \\\\). Differentiating whether squaring occurred before the evolution or not is impossible without further data about the specific temporal sequence of events.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial position x_0 directly influences x(T) through the differential equation, and x_0 also directly influences x^2, which is then transformed into h(x). The constant k directly influences x(T) and there are no direct causal links between x^2 and x(T) other than through x."
