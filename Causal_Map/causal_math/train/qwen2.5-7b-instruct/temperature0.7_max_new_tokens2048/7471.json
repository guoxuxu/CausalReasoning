  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing a periodic signal in the complex plane. We explore the consequences of applying the Fourier transform \\\\( F \\), which converts it into its frequency domain representation.\n\nIf during the interval of transformation, a modulation by \\\\( e^{i\\beta t} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\beta \\\\) is another constant) is introduced, will the dominant frequency component of the Fourier transform still be at \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( e^{i\\beta t} \\\\) acts as an additional periodic modulation, shifting the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) by \\\\( \\beta \\\\) due to the properties of frequency modulation in Fourier analysis, resulting in a dominant component at \\\\( \\omega + \\beta \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "introducing modulation by e^(iβt) changes the Fourier transform, which alters the dominant frequency component from ω to potentially another frequency depending on β."
