  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where we study the impact of a transformation given by \\\\( h(z) = e^{wz} \\\\) on the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{z} e^{t^{2}} dt \\\\) over a complex variable z, with w being another constant complex number.\n\nGiven an outcome of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at \\\\( z = Z \\\\), and not knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, can the exact original complex value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) be deduced?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, it is not possible to uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) because the function \\\\( e^{wz} \\\\) might have changed the argument in a non-linear and non-reversible way, affecting the outcome dynamically.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of f(z) at z=Z is influenced by the integral of e^(t^2) from 0 to z. The transformation h(z) = e^(wz) modifies f(z), and z determines the original input that led to z_0."
