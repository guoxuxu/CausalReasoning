  "Problem": "Assume a linear system described by the equation \\(\\dot{z} = Mz\\), where \\(M\\) is a linear operator. We examine the role of a transformation initiated by \\(\\Gamma(z) = Qz\\), \\(Q\\) being another linear operator, applied at an initial time \\(t = 0\\).\n\nIf \\(\\Gamma(z)\\) is applied to a vector \\(z_0\\) at \\(t = 0\\) and then allowed to evolve under \\(\\dot{z} = Mz\\) without any further intervention, will \\(z(t)\\) at \\(t = T\\) be equivalent to if \\(z_0\\) evolved directly to \\(t = T\\) under \\(\\dot{z} = Mz\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\(\\Gamma(z) = Qz\\) at \\(t = 0\\) alters the initial condition from \\(z_0\\) to \\(Qz_0\\). Since the evolution equation does not revert the effect of \\(Q\\), \\(z(t)\\) at time \\(T\\) evolves from \\(Qz_0\\) rather than from \\(z_0\\), leading to a potentially different final state depending on the properties of \\(Q\\) and \\(M\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying Γ(z) to z_0 at t=0 transforms it to z(0+), which then evolves under M to become z(T). Without applying Γ(z), z_0 directly evolves under M to become z(T) at t=T."
