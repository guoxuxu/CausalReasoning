  "Problem": "Consider a system described by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u) \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. The impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), which converts the function \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) into its frequency components \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,t) \\\\), is analyzed over time.\n\nIf \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) and then the system evolves under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u) \\\\) without intervention, will \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x,T)) \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,0) \\\\) was evolved to T under the transformed system \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\hat{u}}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\mathcal{F}(L(u)) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is a linear operator, and the evolution under the transformed system effectively corresponds to applying the operator to the evolutionary dynamics described by \\\\( L \\\\). Transforming first and then applying \\\\( L \\\\) results in the same outcome as applying \\\\( L \\\\) first and then transforming.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Fourier transform to the initial condition u(x,0) yields hat{u}(k,0), which then evolves to hat{u}(k,T) under the transformed system's dynamics. Similarly, evolving u(x,T) through the original system results in hat{u}(k,T) via the Fourier transform."
