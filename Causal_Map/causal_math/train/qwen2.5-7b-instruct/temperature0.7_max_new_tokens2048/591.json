  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), leading to a transformed function \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - iw} \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention is applied at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) in the form of multiplying \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by another exponential function \\\\( e^{iut} \\\\) where \\\\( u \\\\) is a real constant, would the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) still represent the original frequency \\\\( w \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the intervention modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( e^{i(w+u)t} \\\\). The resulting Laplace transform changes to represent the new combined frequency \\\\( w+u \\\\), thus no longer solely representing the original frequency \\\\( w \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Multiplying z(t) by e^(iut) changes z(t) but does not affect the frequency w in Z(s); t_1 only affects z(t) at that specific time without changing its frequency; w directly influences Z(s); u modifies z(t) but w remains unchanged in Z(s)"
