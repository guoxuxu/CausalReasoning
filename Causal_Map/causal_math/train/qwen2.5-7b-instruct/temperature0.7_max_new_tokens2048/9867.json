  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), evolving over time t according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\). We investigate whether the application of a Fourier transform affects the interpretation or evolution of the function.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation, specifically an inverse Fourier transform is applied as an intervention, and then the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is analyzed at a later time T, will the observation depend solely on the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of an inverse Fourier transform mid-evolution introduces a shift back to the time domain, but the previous application of the Fourier transform followed by its inverse can introduce phase shifts or other changes not accounted for solely by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\). These transformations alter how the function returns to and behaves in the time domain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Time t directly influences the function z(t); the rate of change of z(t) is directly influenced by z(t); applying an intervention (inverse Fourier transform) at time t1 leads to a transformed version of z(t) at time T; z(t) directly influences the transformed version of z(T)"
