  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t. An integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is defined such that \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{st}z(s) ds \\\\), where s is a complex parameter.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) and then is allowed to evolve under its natural dynamics without further intervention, will the end result at time \\\\( T \\\\) be the same as if it was simply evolved naturally without application of \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T \\\\) modifies the original function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) by integrating it over time multiplied by an exponential factor. This process fundamentally changes the trajectory of the function, leading to a difference in the end result at time \\\\( T \\\\) compared to natural evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation T to z_0(t) and then allowing it to evolve under natural dynamics leads to z(t), which is different from evolving z_0(t) naturally without applying T."
