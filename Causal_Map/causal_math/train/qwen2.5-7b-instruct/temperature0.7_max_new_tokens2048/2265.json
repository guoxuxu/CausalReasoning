  "Problem": "Consider a complex function given by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) where A is a constant real matrix and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We investigate how the complex transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^k \\\\), where k is a positive integer, influences z(t) over time.\n\nWhen the transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^k \\\\) is applied to an initial state \\\\( z_0 = e^{iA0} \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T = k*pi/A be the same as if no transformation was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( z^k \\\\) raises the function to the power k, which alters its phase by k times the original. Although the phase multiplied by k reduces back to its original value at T = k*pi/A, the transformation can involve a multivalued function (depending on k), causing the resultant function to potentially differ.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
