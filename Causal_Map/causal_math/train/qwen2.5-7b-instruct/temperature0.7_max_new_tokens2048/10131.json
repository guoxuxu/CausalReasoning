  "Problem": "Consider a differential operator \\\\( L[y] = \\\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} - y \\\\) operating in a complex function space. We investigate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)\\\\, dt \\\\) on functions that are solutions to the differential equation \\\\( L[y] = 0 \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention by applying another operator, say \\\\( M[y] = y + \\\\frac{dy}{dx} \\\\), is performed on \\\\( y(x) \\\\) before applying \\\\( T \\\\), will the new transformed function \\\\( T[M[y]](s) \\\\) adhere to the original transformed differential equation dictated by L?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the operator \\\\( M \\\\) changes the dynamics of the original function, which in turn alters the outcome under the transformation \\\\( T \\\\). The resulting function will not satisfy the transformed differential equation based on \\\\( L \\\\) but rather a new equation reflecting the effects of \\\\( M \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the differential operator L to y results in 0; applying the operator M to y produces M[y]; applying the integral transformation T to M[y] produces T[M[y]](s); applying L to T[M[y]](s) results in the transformed equation."
