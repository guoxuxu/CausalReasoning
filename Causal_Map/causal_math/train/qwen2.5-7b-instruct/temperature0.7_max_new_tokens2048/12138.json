  "Problem": "Consider an integral operation on the complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) within the contour integral along a closed curve \\\\( C \\\\. The transformation to be applied is \\\\( g(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) before executing the integral.\n\nIf we intervene by applying another transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{-iz} \\\\) in the middle of calculating the integral of the already transformed function \\\\( e^{iz} z^2 \\\\), will the result only be impacted by this new transformation and not the structure of \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both the initial transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( h(z) = e^{-iz} \\\\) will influence the final result of the integral, as these transformations interact with each other and the functional form of \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\). The outcome will be a combined effect of all applied operations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying g(z) = e^(iz) transforms the original function f(z) = z^2, and then applying h(z) = e^(-iz) further modifies the integrand before integration. The result of the integral is influenced by both g(z) and h(z), but primarily by h(z) due to its application after g(z)."
