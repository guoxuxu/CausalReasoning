  "Problem": "Assume a linear system of differential equations characterized by \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Mx + Nf \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( f \\\\) represents an external controlled input. The impact of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = F(s) \\\\) on the system's response is evaluated, considering different functional forms of \\\\( f \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( f(t) \\\\) at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by adding an additional function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), will the Laplace transform of the output at time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) reflect only the original system matrix \\\\( M \\\\) and not the characteristics of \\\\( N \\\\), \\\\( f \\\\), or \\\\( g \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by adding \\\\( g(t) \\\\) affects the system input, which in turn modifies the overall system response. The system's output becomes a function of the matrices \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\), as well as both inputs \\\\( f \\\\) and \\\\( g \\\\) due to their cumulative effect in the system's dynamics, distinctly visible in the Laplace transform of the output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An intervention modifying f(t) at time t1 by adding g(t) influences the system's output x(t) through M and N, but the Laplace transform X(s) of the output at time T > t1 reflects primarily the system matrix M and the transformed inputs F(s) and G(s), without directly incorporating the characteristics of N."
