  "Problem": "Examine the causal impacts within a system described by a linear partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + A \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a constant matrix. The study involves the Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(u)(s, x) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}u(t, x) dt \\\\) on the function over time.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(u)(s, x) \\\\) at a complex variable \\\\( s \\\\) and a fixed position \\\\( x \\\\), can we uniquely determine the initial condition \\\\( u(0, x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform is a bijective transformation for linear homogeneous PDEs under certain conditions such as no singularities which allow recovering \\\\( u(0, x) \\\\) from \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(u)(s, x) \\\\). This presupposes no external modifications or interventions in the mathematical model.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
