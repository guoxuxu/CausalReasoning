  "Problem": "Consider the complex function defined as \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\). Investigate the effects of a transformation by matrix \\( M \\) where \\( M \\) effects the amplitude and frequency. The transformed variable is \\( w(t) = M z(t) \\). Let's analyze using variable separation and integral transformations.\n\nIf at a random time t = t1, a new intervention by a matrix \\( N \\) is applied yielding \\( u(t) = N w(t) \\), will the result \\( u(T) \\), for T > t1, depend solely on the original \\( \\omega \\) and not on the characteristics of \\( M \\) or \\( N \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both matrices \\( M \\) and \\( N \\) influence the result due to their potential to alter amplitude, frequency, and phase. The end state \\( u(T) \\) depends on the combination of these transformations alongside \\( \\omega \\), complicating prediction and dependency on just \\( \\omega \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "A new intervention by matrix N at time t1 transforms w(t) into u(t), and the value of u(T) for T > t1 depends on w(t1) which itself is influenced by M, but not solely on the original ω."
