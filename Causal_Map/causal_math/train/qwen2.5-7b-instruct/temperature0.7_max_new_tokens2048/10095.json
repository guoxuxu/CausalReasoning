  "Problem": "Consider a heat equation \\\\(u_t = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta u\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\kappa\\\\) is the heat conductivity coefficient, and \\\\(\\\\Delta\\\\) is the Laplacian operator. Let's analyze the introduction of an external heat source \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\), which varies over time and space, via the modification of the equation to \\\\(u_t = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta u + h(x, t)\\\\).\n\nIf an intervention by changing the conductivity coefficient \\\\(\\\\kappa\\\\) to a different value \\\\(\\\\kappa'\\\\) is made at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the heat distribution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) where \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) depend solely on the new conductivity \\\\(\\\\kappa'\\\\) and ignore the previous \\\\(\\\\kappa\\\\) values and \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\) values applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transient effects and the previously applied heat source \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\) alongside changes in conductivity affect how heat spreads and accumulates, impacting the end temperature distribution not just based on the current value \\\\(\\\\kappa'\\\\) but also past influences.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
