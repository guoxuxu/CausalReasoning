  "Problem": "Consider a continuous-time system where the growth rate is governed by a differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax + R(t)\\\\), where A is a linear operator and R(t) is a time-dependent function incorporating environmental factors. We analyze the impact of a control transformation \\\\( h(x) = e^{Ct}x \\\\) applied at a deterministic time interval.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can the specific timing and nature (whether A, R(t), or \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied) of interventions be explicitly deduced from \\\\( x(T) \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is shaped by potentially complex interactions between A, R(t) and any control transformations like \\\\( h(x) \\\\). These overlapping influences contribute to indistinguishable pathways leading to the same final state, thus obscuring the ability to pinpoint specific interventions or their timings solely based on \\\\( x(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The growth rate of x is determined by A and R(t), with R(t) varying over time and h(x) transforming x over time, influenced by t."
