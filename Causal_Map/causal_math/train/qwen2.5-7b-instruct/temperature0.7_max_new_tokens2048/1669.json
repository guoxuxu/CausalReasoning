  "Problem": "Consider a system of complex functions where \\\\(z(t)\\\\) evolves over time according to \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz(t)\\\\), with M being a constant complex matrix. We analyze the change when applying a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{iNt}z \\\\), where N is another constant complex matrix and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit.\n\nIf we apply the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) to an initial complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at time t = 0 and subsequently let it evolve by \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz(t)\\\\) without any further intervention, will the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for some t = T be the same as if we had evolved \\\\( z_0 \\\\) directly under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz(t)\\\\) up to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) initially changes the state to \\\\( e^{iN0}z_0 = z_0 \\\\), but as t increases, the effect of \\\\( e^{iNt} \\\\) modifies the trajectory, leading to differing outcomes depending on the relationship and commutativity of N with M.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation g(z) to z_0 results in z'(t), which, when evolved under M, leads to z(T). Directly evolving z_0 under M leads to z(T). Therefore, the trajectory z(T) after applying g(z) and then evolving under M is equivalent to directly evolving z_0 under M."
