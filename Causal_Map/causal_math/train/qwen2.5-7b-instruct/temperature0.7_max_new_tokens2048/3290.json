  "Problem": "Analyze the interplay of linear transformations and differential operators in a vector space. Assume we have a set of equations represented by \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\) where D is a constant matrix. Then, explore the effects of applying a transformation \\\\(g(z) = Rz\\\\), where R is also a constant matrix.\n\nCan we infer the initial vector \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\(g(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without prior knowledge of the application of the transformation \\\\(g(z) = Rz\\\\), the derivation of \\\\(z_0\\\\) from \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is not straightforward. The system’s state could have been altered by R in a manner that obscures the original conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The matrix D determines the evolution of z(t) from z(0), the transformation R changes z to g(z), and g(z) influences the observed z(t)."
