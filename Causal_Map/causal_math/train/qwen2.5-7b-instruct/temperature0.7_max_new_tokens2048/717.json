  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function z defined over the complex plane as \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\) where \\\\(\\omega\\\\) is a constant real number. This function is being transformed by a linear operator \\\\(L\\\\) defined such that \\\\(L(z) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt\\\\), which resembles the Laplace transform but over a modified domain.\n\nIf initially \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\\\) is applied and transformed by \\\\(L\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(L(z)\\\\) be finite?",
  "Explanation": "The integral \\\\(L(z) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st}e^{i\\omega t} dt\\\\) does not converge unless \\\\(s > 0\\\\) and real, because the oscillatory nature of \\\\(e^{i\\omega t}\\\\) does not contribute to the decay required for convergence in the absence of a sufficiently large real component in \\\\(s\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
