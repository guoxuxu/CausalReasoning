  "Problem": "We consider a mathematical model where two complex variables, z and w, are related via the transform \\( f(z) = ze^{iw} \\) at an initial time t = 0. Over time, w evolves according to the differential equation \\( \\\\frac{dw}{dt} = Aw \\), with A being a complex constant. We examine the influence of an early intervention at a time \\( t_1 \\) defined by the function \\( g(w) = w + C \\), where C is another complex constant.\n\nGiven the observation of \\( z(t) \\) at t = T, can we deduce the original value \\( z_0 \\) and w at t = 0 without knowing whether \\( f(z) \\) or \\( g(w) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific knowledge of whether \\( f(z) \\) was initially applied and without knowledge of the value of w at t = 0 or the application of \\( g(w) \\), it is not possible to reliably trace back to \\( z_0 \\) and w since w affects z dynamically through \\( f(z) \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "z_0 directly influences z(t) through the transformation f(z). w directly influences z(t) through the same transformation f(z). t_1 indirectly influences w through the function g(w), and thus indirectly influences z(t) through f(z)."
