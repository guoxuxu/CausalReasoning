  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that solves the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where D is a diffusion coefficient. We explore the impact of applying a Fourier transform to \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx} u(x, t) dx \\\\).\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), we introduce a modification of the PDE parameters (e.g., a change in D), will the Fourier transform at time T solely depend on the new parameter settings without influence from the original settings?",
  "Explanation": "The solution at time T, and consequently its Fourier transform, will still depend on the evolution of the system from 0 to \\\\( t_1 \\\\) under the original parameter settings. Only the evolution from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T will depend on the new parameters, making the final state at T a function of both parameter regimes.",
