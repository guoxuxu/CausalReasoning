  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We also define a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another constant matrix, applied to the function z over the time period t.\n\nWhen an intervention in the form of another function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is a constant matrix) is applied at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend independently on A and B, and not be influenced by C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The sequence of transformations first through \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and later \\\\( g(z) \\\\) affects the real and imaginary components of z. Hence, the final state at T will consider the effects of A, B, C, and D collectively. Compositional impacts of these matrices determine divergent trajectories for z in the complex plane.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
