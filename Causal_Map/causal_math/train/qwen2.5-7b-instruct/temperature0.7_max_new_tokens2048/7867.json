  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in the complex plane evolves according to the equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), with A being a real constant. An external input transformation function \\\\( h(z) = ze^{iBt} \\\\), with B being another real constant, is applied at specific instances.\n\nIf an intervention using another transformation \\\\( k(z) = ze^{-iCt} \\\\) (where C is a constant) is applied at midpoint \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) only depend on the properties of A, ignoring effects from B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) using \\\\( k(z) = ze^{-iCt} \\\\) modifies the phase evolution of the system, resulting in a trajectory that is influenced by B, C, and A. The resulting state, \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is a compounded effect of all transformations applied up to T, hence not solely depending on A.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of z(t) depends on A, h(z) transforms z(t) but does not affect its fundamental evolution driven by A, and k(z) temporarily modifies z(t) at t1 but does not permanently alter its dependence on A for T > t1."
