  "Problem": "Consider a linear algebra framework analyzing the effect of matrix diagonalization on eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The system examines the matrix transformation \\\\( P^{-1}AP \\\\), where A is an initial matrix and P is the matrix formed by the eigenvectors of A.\n\nGiven a resultant matrix after applying transformations D and then \\\\( Q^{-1}DQ \\\\), can the original matrices A and P be uniquely identified just by observing the transformed matrix?",
  "Explanation": "Since any matrix diagonalizable in one basis is typically diagonalizable in many others, multiple combinations of A and P might result in the same diagonal matrix D, which when further transformed by Q does not uniquely specify A and P. Thus, knowing the final output alone is insufficient for backtracking to unique origins.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The original matrix A influences the resultant matrix D through diagonalization, and the matrix P influences D by providing its eigenvectors. The matrix D influences Q through similarity transformation, and Q influences the final matrix QDQ^-1."
