  "Problem": "Consider a mapping of functions where \\\\( g(u, x) \\\\) and \\\\( h(x, z) \\\\) are integral transforms with respective kernels \\\\( K_1 \\\\) and \\\\( K_2 \\\\. The system explores the influence of transformations \\\\( u(x) = \\\\int K_1(x, t) f(t) dt \\\\) and \\\\( z(x) = \\\\int K_2(x, s) u(s) ds \\\\), analysing dynamics between input \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and output \\\\( z(x) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is input at t = 0 and evolves to produce \\\\( u(x) \\\\) and subsequently \\\\( z(x) \\\\), will \\\\( z(x) \\\\) at a later time X depend solely on the initial \\\\( f(t) \\\\) under the transformations defined by \\\\( K_1 \\\\) and \\\\( K_2 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\( z(x) \\\\) at any position x is directly dependent on the initial input \\\\( f(t) \\\\) through the integral transformations governed by kernels \\\\( K_1 \\\\) and \\\\( K_2 \\\\. Since these transformations are specific and deterministic, the output dependency is fixed barring any changes or interventions in the transformations themselves.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
