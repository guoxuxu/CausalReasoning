  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) denotes the imaginary unit. This function is subjected to a Fourier transform, represented as \\\\( \\hat{z}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\xi t} z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is directly subjected to the Fourier transform without any modifications, will the result \\\\( \\hat{z}(\\xi) \\\\) be a delta function centered at \\\\( \\xi = \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) is indeed a delta function \\\\( \\delta(\\xi - \\omega) \\\\). This indicates that the transform acts as an identity over the frequency component \\\\( \\omega \\\\), perfectly capturing the unique frequency present in \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The function z(t) is transformed into hat{z}(ξ) through the Fourier transform process, with ω influencing z(t) and ξ determining the center of the resulting delta function."
