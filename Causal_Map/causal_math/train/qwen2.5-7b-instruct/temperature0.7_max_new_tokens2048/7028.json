  "Problem": "Consider the control of a heat equation \\\\( u_t = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta u \\\\) on a domain, where \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is a thermal diffusivity constant and \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) denotes the Laplacian. An intervention involves changing boundary conditions at a specific time using a function \\\\( h(t,x) = e^{\\\\lambda t}g(x) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is a spatial function.\n\nCan the precise nature of interventions (whether \\\\( h(t,x) \\\\), \\\\( k(x) \\\\), or both) be determined from the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at a fixed time T?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple sequences or types of interventions could yield the same temperature profile at time T, especially due to the superposition principle and the linearity of the heat equation. The overlapping effects of various boundary manipulations make it challenging to pinpoint exactly what interventions were performed.",
