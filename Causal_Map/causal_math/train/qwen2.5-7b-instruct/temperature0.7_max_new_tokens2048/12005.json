  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation \\\\( T: f(x) \\\\mapsto \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number. The causal relationship of this transformation in signal processing contexts (Laplace Transform) is studied.\n\nCan we revert accurately to the original function \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} \\\\) after applying the Laplace Transform and then performing the inverse Laplace Transform without knowing the value of \\\\( s \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Laplace Transform can indeed revert \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) back to \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) accurately given that the correct range of \\\\( s \\\\) is chosen making Re(s) greater than \\\\( a \\\\) to ensure convergence, emphasizing the bijectiveness of the Laplace Transform on this class of functions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
