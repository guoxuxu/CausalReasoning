  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We explore the effects of applying an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z)(t) = \\int_0^t e^{-i\\omega s} z(s) \\, ds \\\\) over time t.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) at t = T, can we determine precisely which frequencies (original or intervened) were used only by examining the value of \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed function \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) at t = T contains integrals of the function over different intervals potentially subjected to different frequencies. Decoupling these frequencies just from the end value without additional information about when changes occurred or their nature is inherently ambiguous due to overlapping contributions of different frequencies to the integral.",
