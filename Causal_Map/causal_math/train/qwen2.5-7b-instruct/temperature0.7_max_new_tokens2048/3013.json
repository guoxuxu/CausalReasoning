  "Problem": "Consider a time-varying complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number. We look at the effects of applying a Fourier transformation defined by the function \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is calculated for \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), and then the result is analyzed without further transformation, will \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) be equal to a delta function centered at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) directly results in a delta function concentrated at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). This is due to the property of the Fourier transform in transforming pure exponential functions into delta functions, reflecting the frequency of the oscillation.",
