  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = u(x(t), y(t)) \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) is a complex function, and both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are functions of time described by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. The interaction between \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) via \\\\( u \\\\) influences the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nAssuming an intervention using another function \\\\( v \\\\), transforming \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\; (0 < t_1 < T) \\\\), will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) demonstrate effects based solely on the new function matrix characteristics and not on the initial interaction matrix of \\\\( u \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention by \\\\( v \\\\) interacts with the already modified state trajectories imparted by \\\\( u \\\\). As such, \\\\( z(T) \\\\)'s final state will depend on how both \\\\( u \\\\) and \\\\( v \\\\) have altered the dynamics of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\), including their interaction.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
