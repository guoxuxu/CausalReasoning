  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{Dt}x \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( x \\\\) is an input vector. The evolution over time is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Az + B \\\\), with \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) also being constant matrices.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention by a function \\\\( f(z) = E^{Ft}z \\\\) (where \\\\( E \\\\) and \\\\( F \\\\) are constant matrices) is applied, will the system's state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( D, C, E, \\\\) or \\\\( F \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention introduces another layer of transformation that affects the system's trajectory. Thus, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on all involved matrices (\\\\( A, D, C, E, \\\\) and \\\\( F \\\\)). These transformations can interact in complex ways, each significantly impacting the system's behavior and final state.",
