  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We investigate the effect of an integral transform \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} K(x, s) u(s, t) ds \\\\) on the solution u(x, t), with K being a kernel function.\n\nCan we infer precisely what transformations (\\\\( T(u) \\\\), \\\\( R(u) \\\\), or both) were applied, based solely on the final observed state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the potential for various transformations to productively interact and produce similar outcomes (due to overlapping effects of K, H, and L), it is not feasible to uniquely discern which transformations were employed based solely on the endpoint \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\). The overlapping influence of different kernels and their interaction with L complicates the backward tracing.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
