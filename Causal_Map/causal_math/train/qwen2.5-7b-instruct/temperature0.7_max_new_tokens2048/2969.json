  "Problem": "Evaluate the causal influence under a system governed by a Laplace transform of the function \\\\( f(t) = t^2 \\\\). Suppose this system evolves through different transformations and interventions represented by high-order derivatives in the spectral domain, specifically considering how various filters influence the signal.\n\nIf the order of derivative applied to \\\\( F(s) \\\\), the Laplace transform of \\\\( f(t) \\), increases, does this exclusively determine the acceleration of growth in the system's output?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the derivative order applied to \\\\( F(s) \\\\) indeed modifies the spectral components, emphasizing higher frequency behaviors; however, these changes depend critically on the system's response characteristics and initial conditions, not solely on the derivative order.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "F(s) → f(t); n → d^nF(s)/ds^n; d^nF(s)/ds^n → d^(n+1)f(t)/dt^(n+1); d^nf(t)/dt^n → acceleration_of_growth",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace transform F(s) of the function f(t) = t^2, when subjected to higher-order derivatives, causes an increase in the rate of change of f(t), which determines the acceleration of growth in the system's output."
