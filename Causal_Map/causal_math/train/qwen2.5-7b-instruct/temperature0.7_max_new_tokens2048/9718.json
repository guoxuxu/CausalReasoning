  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}z_0 \\\\) is used to describe the time evolution of a system in the complex plane, where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real number and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex value.\n\nGiven \\\\( z(T) \\\\), and knowing it evolved under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}z_0 \\\\), can we determine whether \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "If only the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and the transformation \\\\( e^{iwt} \\\\) are known, it is not possible to conclusively determine if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was squared, since multiple initial conditions can evolve into the same endpoint. The squaring could lead to multiple potential initial conditions or trajectories.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial complex value z_0 directly influences z(t) through the transformation equation. The angular frequency w directly influences z(t) through the same equation. z(t) directly influences z(T) as it represents the state at time T. z_0 directly influences h(z) through the function h(z) = z^2. h(z) indirectly influences h(z(T)) as h(z(T)) is the result of applying h(z) to z(T)."
