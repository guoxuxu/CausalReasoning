  "Problem": "Consider a complex system modeled by the equation \\\\( z'(t) = Mz(t) \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a square matrix. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Ns} z(s) ds \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( N \\\\) is another square matrix.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we definitively trace back the original function before the integral transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) obscures original properties of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), particularly due to the integral nature which mixes the function's values over an interval. With only the resulting \\\\( z(T) \\\\), the exact pre-transformation state of the function is untraceable without additional information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The derivative of z with respect to time t is caused by M, which is a square matrix. The exponential of Ns causes the transformation of z(s). This transformation, when integrated from 0 to t, results in T(z). The value of t determines the time T."
