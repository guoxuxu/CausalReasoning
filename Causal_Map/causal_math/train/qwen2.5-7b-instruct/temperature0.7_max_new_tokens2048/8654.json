  "Problem": "Consider an electrical RLC circuit with resistors, capacitors, and inductors described by the differential equation \\\\(V(t) = L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI + \\\\frac{1}{C} \\\\int I dt\\\\), where L is the inductance, R is the resistance, C is the capacitance, I is the current, and V(t) is the input voltage at time t.\n\nGiven the current waveform \\\\(I(t)\\\\) at t = T, can you determine if the applied voltage \\\\(V(t)\\\\) was sinusoidal from t = 0 to T without intervening?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of reactive components (L and C) affects the phase and amplitude of the current relative to the voltage. Without knowing the exact parameters of L and C or their effects on the system over time, inferring the precise form of \\\\(V(t)\\\\) from \\\\(I(t)\\\\) is not feasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Inductance L, resistance R, capacitance C, and current I(t) each contribute to the applied voltage V(t) through the differential and integral relationships in the RLC circuit equation."
