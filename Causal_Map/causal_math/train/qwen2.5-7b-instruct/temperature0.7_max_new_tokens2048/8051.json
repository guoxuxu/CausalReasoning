  "Problem": "Consider a system with a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}y(t) \\\\) where \\\\( y(t) \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = My\\\\), and M is a constant matrix. We study the effect of a transformation \\\\( h(y) = e^{Dt}y \\\\) applied at different instances, where D is another constant matrix.\n\nIf a different function \\\\( k(y) = e^{Ft}y \\\\) (where F is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the state of \\\\( y(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 exclusively reflect changes due to F and not D?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( k(y) = e^{Ft}y \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces an additional factor influencing the trajectory of the system. The final state, \\\\( y(T) \\\\), hinges on the effects of both D and F on the system; thus, it reflects influences from both transformations, compounding their effects on the system evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
