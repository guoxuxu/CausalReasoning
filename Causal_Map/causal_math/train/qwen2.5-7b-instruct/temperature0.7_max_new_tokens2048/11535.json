  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in complex domain as \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) and a mapping function given by \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\). We explore the impact of their composition \\\\( h(z) = g(f(z)) \\\\) and transformations related to the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\), where C is a contour in the complex plane.\n\nIf an intervention alters \\\\( f(z) \\\\) to \\\\( f(z) + k \\\\), where k is a constant complex number, and we evaluate \\\\( \\\\int_C f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\), will the effect on the integral value depend only on the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Adding a constant k to the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) changes the integrand to \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{z} + k \\\\). The integral of k over any closed contour C in complex analysis is zero due to Cauchy's theorem. However, the presence of k could influence the evaluation process or interpretations, and the integral still fundamentally depends on the contour and the nature of the original function.",
