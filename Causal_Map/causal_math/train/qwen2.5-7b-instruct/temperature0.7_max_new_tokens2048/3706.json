  "Problem": "Examine the effect of a Laplace transform on a continuous function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) that is subjected to the operator \\\\( L[g(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}g(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number. Analyze scenarios where an additional transformation \\\\( h(t) = t^2 g(t) \\\\) is applied.\n\nFrom observing \\\\( G(s) \\\\) after applying \\\\( L[g(t)] \\\\), can we determine if \\\\( h(t) = t^2 g(t) \\\\) was initially applied to \\\\( g(t) \\\\) without knowing the transformation explicitly?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( L \\\\) computes the Laplace transform of the input function as it is provided, without previous knowledge about whether or not \\\\( h(t) \\\\) was applied, we cannot deduce its application merely from the output \\\\( G(s) \\\\). The functional modification by \\\\( t^2 \\\\) is lost unless explicitly known.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Laplace transform to g(t) results in G(s), and applying the Laplace transform to h(t) = t^2 * g(t) results in H(s), where H(s) is related to G(s) through the property of Laplace transforms."
