  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear operator. We investigate the effects of applying a Fourier transform, denoted as \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t))\\\\), on this system.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) exactly after observing \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) at time T without knowing the action of operator L?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific knowledge of how the operator L transforms under the Fourier transform (i.e., what \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(L)\\\\) is), we cannot uniquely determine \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) from \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\). Knowledge of L is crucial for accurately tracing back from \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) to \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u(x, 0) evolves over time to become u(x, t), which is then transformed by the linear operator L to produce the system's dynamics. Observing the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) at time T allows us to infer the original function u(x, 0) if the operator L is known."
