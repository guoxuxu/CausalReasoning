  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) passes through a series of transforms: firstly by Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), followed by a scaling function in the frequency domain \\\\( S(\\\\omega) \\\\), and then by inverse Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\). Analyze the impact of this transformation chain and its effect on the time-domain behavior of \\\\( x(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\), is it possible to determine the original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without additional information about \\\\( S(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without detailed knowledge of the scaling function \\\\( S(\\\\omega) \\\\), the effect of scaling on the Fourier transform cannot be undone reliably. This makes it ambiguous in reconstructing the original signal exactly from \\\\( y(t) \\\\) alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The original signal x(t) is transformed by the Fourier transform to the frequency domain, modified by the scaling function S(ω), and then inverse-transformed back to the time domain to produce y(t). The original signal x(t) → y(t) through the Fourier transform and inverse Fourier transform, while the scaling function S(ω) → y(t) in the frequency domain."
