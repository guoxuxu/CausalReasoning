  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\), where \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) are real functions of time \\( t \\) and \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit. The function is subjected to the Fourier transformation defined by \\( F(z(t)) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty z(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt \\), where \\( \\omega \\) represents angular frequency.\n\nIf a specific \\( z(t) \\) function, say \\( z(t) = e^t \\), is transformed using the Fourier transform, will \\( F(z(t)) \\) at \\( \\omega = 1 \\) be same for any \\( t \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\( e^t \\) for \\( \\omega = 1 \\) is a standard result that does not depend on the specific instance of time \\( t \\). It treats the function globally over the entire time domain rather than at specific instances, resulting in a consistent transform output for any \\( t \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of \\( z(t) \\) at any time \\( t \\\\) determines the Fourier transform \\( F(z(t)) \\\\) at angular frequency \\( \\\\omega \\\\), and specifically, at \\( \\\\omega = 1 \\\\), the value of \\( F(z(t)) \\\\) will vary with \\( t \\\\) because \\( z(t) = e^t \\\\) is time-dependent."
