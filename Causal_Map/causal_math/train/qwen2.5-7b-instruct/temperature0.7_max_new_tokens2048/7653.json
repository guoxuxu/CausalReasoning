  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( g(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\) defined over complex numbers, and its transformation over time t using \\\\( T(p(z)) = \\\\int_0^t e^{z^2} dz \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T(p(z)) \\\\) is applied at \\( z_0 \\) without any further modification, does the value of \\ T(p(z_0)) \\) at \\( t = T \\) change significantly from \\( g(z_0) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation involves integrating the exponential of the square of z, significantly altering the behavior and magnitude of the function compared to the initial function \\\\( g(z_0) = e^{z_0^2} \\). The integral accumulates and magnifies changes, leading to a different function value.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of g(z_0) at t=0 influences T(p(z_0)) at t=T, but T(p(z_0)) at t=T does not significantly change from g(z_0) at t=0 due to the integral transformation."
