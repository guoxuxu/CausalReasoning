  "Problem": "Consider a function defined as \\\\(z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\omega s} x(s) \\, ds\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) represents the input signal and \\\\(e^{i\\omega s}\\\\) is a complex exponential function used for frequency analysis. The transformation aims to filter or modify the frequency components of \\\\(x(t)\\\\).\n\nBased on the observed spectrum of \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we uniquely determine both the original frequency of \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and the intervention frequency \\\\(\\eta\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the nature of frequency transformation and superposition in the spectrum, observing \\\\(z(T)\\\\)'s spectrum alone does not uniquely determine both frequencies. The observed frequencies could arise from multiple combinations of base and intervention frequencies, resulting in inherent ambiguity without additional information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
