  "Problem": "Analyze a Fourier Transform scenario where a function \\\\( f(x) = e^{-x^2} \\\\) is transformed into its Fourier counterpart \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) and affected by a convolution with a Gaussian kernel \\\\( g(x) = e^{-a x^2} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nAfter observing the final state by either method described above, can we accurately determine whether the convolution was performed in the frequency domain or the spatial domain?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the convolution theorem and the reversible properties of the Fourier transform, the end result of the convolution does not retain information about the domain in which the convolution was performed. Both methods are mathematically equivalent and lead to indistinguishable outcomes.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The function f(x) transforms into F(ω) via Fourier transform; f(x) also affects g(x); F(ω) convolves with G(ω) to produce F(ω) * G(ω); this convolution results in f_conv(x); g(x) transforms into G(ω) via Fourier transform; the convolution F(ω) * G(ω) in the frequency domain produces f_conv(x) in the spatial domain."
