  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. The system undergoes a Fourier transformation \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) dt \\\\), which modifies its spectral components.\n\nGiven \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at a frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), is it possible to exactly recover \\\\( z(0) \\\\), the original state at t = 0, without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "While the inverse Fourier transform can theoretically recover \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( F(z) \\\\), perfect reconstruction of \\\\( z(0) \\\\) from a single frequency component \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is not feasible without the complete spectrum. Individual frequency components do not contain all necessary information due to the frequency-domain transformation.",
