  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\mathcal{L}u\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) is a function of both space and time, and \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) is a linear differential operator. We explore the effect of applying a Fourier transform, denoted by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), on the system and querying causality with and without intervention.\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\(u(0, x)\\\\) undergoes a Fourier transform into \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(0, k)\\\\), and then is evolved according to the differential operator without any further intervention, will the transformed solution \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(t, k)\\\\) at time t obey the transformed version of the partial differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying a Fourier transform to the initial condition and evolving it under the differential operator behaves predictably, with the transformed system obeying the Fourier-transformed differential equation due to the linearity and time-invariance of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\). The Fourier transform merely changes the domain from spatial to frequency without altering the intrinsic causal relationships ruled by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u(0, x) directly influences u(t, x) through the evolution governed by the differential operator L. Applying the Fourier transform to the initial condition u(0, x) results in \\tilde{u}(0, k), which then evolves under the transformed operator to produce \\tilde{u}(t, k). The operator L acting on u in the spatial domain corresponds to a multiplication by k in the frequency domain, thus \\mathcal{L}u transforms to a multiplication by k on \\tilde{u}."
