  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), and let's introduce an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-i\\\\omega s} f(s) \\\\, ds \\\\). We explore how this transformation affects the function over time through different causal pathways and interventions.\n\nIf \\\\( T \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\leq 0 \\\\) and then the system evolves without further intervention, will the transformed function at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was transformed at t = T directly?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) applied initially changes the trajectory of the function. Because \\\\( T \\\\) depends on the integral up to that time, the resulting function at any time t will reflect the accumulated history of the transformation, which is different from directly applying \\\\( T \\\\) at t = T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "If z(t) is less than or equal to zero, applying transformation T at time t results in T[z](t), which then evolves to T[z](T) without further intervention. Directly applying transformation T to z(t) at time T results in T[f](T). The transformed function at t=T depends on whether the transformation is applied at t or directly at T."
