  "Problem": "Evaluate how the Laplace Transform impacts the causality between a pair of functions \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\), where \\( v(t) = t^2 \\) and \\( u(t) \\) is its derivative using the relation \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f'(t)\\} = sF(s) - f(0) \\), where \\( F(s) \\) is the Laplace Transform of \\( f(t) \\).\n\nIf \\( v(t) = t^2 \\) and its derivative \\( u(t) \\) is computed and then transformed using the Laplace Transform, will \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\} \\) accurately represent the derivative of \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{v(t)\\} \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The derivative \\( u(t) \\) of \\( v(t) \\) is \\( 2t \\). Using the Laplace relation, we find \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\} = \\mathcal{L}\\{2t\\} = 2/s^2 \\), which is indeed the result of differentiating \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{t^2\\} = 2/s^3 \\) by \\( s \\) after applying the operator.",
