  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\) where s is a complex number. Analyze the causality and effects of modifying the function by a multiplicative factor \\\\( h(t) = e^{kt} \\\\), where k is a constant.\n\nHaving the transformed result \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), can we accurately deduce whether the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was modified by \\\\( h(t) = e^{kt} \\\\) before applying the integral transform?",
  "Explanation": "The result \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) might appear similarly for different original functions under transformations, and without additional information about the pre-transform function modification or specifics of k, it is not possible to definitively infer the use of \\\\( h(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Modifying the function z(t) by multiplying it with h(t) = e^(kt) directly changes the resulting transformed function Z(s). The transformation Z(s) contains information about z(t) including its modification by h(t), but does not directly reveal if such a modification occurred without additional context."
