  "Problem": "Examine the implications of the integral transformation \\\\( I[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) \\\\,dt \\\\) on a function \\\\( f(t) = t^n \\\\), where \\\\( n \\\\) is a positive integer, when a multiplier transformation \\\\( g(t) = t^m \\\\) is also applied either before or after \\\\( I[f] \\\\), with \\\\( m \\\\) also being a positive integer.\n\nAfter applying \\\\( I[f] \\\\) to a function \\\\( t^n \\\\) and then observing its outcome multplied by \\\\( t^m \\\\), is it possible to definitively determine whether the multiplier \\\\( t^m \\\\) was applied before or after the transformation without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit details on the sequence of operations, one cannot distinguish if \\\\( t^m \\\\) was applied pre or post-integral transformation. The integrals of \\\\( t^n \\\\) and \\\\( t^{n+m} \\\\) are mathematically distinct, but their outcomes do not inherently reveal the order of operations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
