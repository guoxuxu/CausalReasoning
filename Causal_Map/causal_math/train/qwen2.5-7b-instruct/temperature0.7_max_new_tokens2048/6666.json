  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices defining separate dynamical systems for the real and imaginary parts, respectively. We examine the effect of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another constant matrix, on the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nCan we recover the initial complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) precisely at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing if \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the initial transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, it's impossible to ascertain the original state because the transformation \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) could have altered both the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z_0 \\\\), thereby obscuring its true starting conditions.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial complex vector z_0 directly causes z(t) at t=0; x(t) and y(t) directly cause z(t); the constant matrix C directly causes e^(Ct); e^(Ct) directly causes z(T); and observing z(t) at t=T allows us to infer z_0 if f(z) was not applied."
