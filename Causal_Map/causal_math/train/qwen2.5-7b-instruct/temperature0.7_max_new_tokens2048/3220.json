  "Problem": "Consider a scenario involving the continuous mapping of a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\), where a is a real constant, and z represents a complex variable. This function is then subjected to a transformation via a linear operator T that acts as an integral transformation, defined by \\\\( T(f) = \\int_{c-i\\infty}^{c+i\\infty} e^{st} f(1-s) ds \\\\), where c and s are complex variables and t is a real parameter.\n\nCan we determine explicitly which interventions (either \\\\( g(f) \\\\), T, or both) were applied just by analyzing the function at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Given the overlapping influence of the exponential operations in both the original transformation and the intervention, and the complex nature of the integral transformation, it is not possible to uniquely pinpoint which operations were applied solely by observing the final state at t = T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
