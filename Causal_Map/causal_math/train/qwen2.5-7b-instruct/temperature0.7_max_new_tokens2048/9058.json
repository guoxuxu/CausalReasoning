  "Problem": "Consider the equation \\\\( z(t) = C \\\\int_0^t \\\\exp(A(s-t))B u(s) \\\\, ds \\\\), where A, B, and C are constant matrices and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a control input. We study the effect of the transformation \\\\( w(t) = Dz(t) \\\\) where D is a transformation matrix.\n\nGiven \\\\( w(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\), can we reconstruct \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) without knowing D?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing D, the operation to derive \\\\( z(0) \\\\) from \\\\( w(T) \\\\) is underdetermined because matrix D could be non-invertible, or there could be multiple solutions satisfying the equation for different D matrices.",
