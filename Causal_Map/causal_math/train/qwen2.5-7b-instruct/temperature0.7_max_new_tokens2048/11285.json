  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex plane as \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\), where z is a complex variable. We analyze the effect of complex conjugation on this function and any potential impacts on integral transformations of the resulting function over time t.\n\nIf the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is transformed by applying the complex conjugate to z, denoted as \\\\( z^* \\\\), and then the Fourier transform is applied, will the resulting function's Fourier transform at t = T be the same as the Fourier transform of the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the complex conjugate alters the function to \\\\( f(z^*) = e^{-iz} \\\\). The Fourier transform of this negated imaginary exponential differs from that of the original function due to the reversal of the sign in the exponent, which fundamentally changes the frequency components.",
