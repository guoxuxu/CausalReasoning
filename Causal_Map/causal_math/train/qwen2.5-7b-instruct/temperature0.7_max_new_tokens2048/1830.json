  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\), where D is a constant matrix. We explore the effect of applying a transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(x) = Mx \\\\), where M is a matrix providing a linear transformation.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowledge of initial transformations, can we infer the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) accurately?",
  "Explanation": "Without entire visibility about the applications of initial transformations such as \\\\( g(x) = Mx \\\\), the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) is generally not retrievable from \\\\( x(t) \\\\) due to potential alterations imposed by M, leading to multiple possible initial vectors that satisfy \\\\( x(t) = e^{Dt}Mx_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "D drives the evolution of x(t), and M transforms x(t) while x(t) at time T depends on the initial vector x_0."
