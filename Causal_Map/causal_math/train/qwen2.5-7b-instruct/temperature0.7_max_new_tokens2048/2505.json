  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\nabla^2 u\\\\), where D is a diffusion coefficient. We study the influence of applying a Fourier transform, denoted as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), to the initial condition \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) of the system.\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) is subjected to a Fourier transform to become \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u(x,0))\\\\) and then allowed to evolve under the PDE without additional transformations, will the state of the system \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) at time T be solely determined by the modified initial condition?",
  "Explanation": "Transforming the initial condition via Fourier transform alters the mode amplitudes and may shift the phase of components, directly setting a new base state for the solution of the PDE. The system's evolution will follow from this modified state, meaning its state at any time T is determined by this transformed initial condition.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u(x,0) influences the state u(x,t) through the evolution governed by the PDE, and applying the Fourier transform F to u(x,0) results in a new initial condition F(u(x,0)), which then evolves to u(x,T) under the same PDE."
