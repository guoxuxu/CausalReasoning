  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, governed by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. The function is subjected to a Fourier Transform, defined by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt\\\\).\n\nIf an intervention is made at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by applying a scaling factor \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) while keeping \\\\( y(t) \\\\) unchanged, will the resultant Fourier Transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) depend solely on the original matrices A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention alters \\\\( x(t) \\\\) selectively, thereby affecting the entire form of \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), and consequently the Fourier Transform. The changes induced by the scaling factor \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) means that the resultant frequency behavior is not solely governed by A and B.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
