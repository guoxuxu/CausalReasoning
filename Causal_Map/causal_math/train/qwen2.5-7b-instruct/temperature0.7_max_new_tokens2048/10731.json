  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving over time according to a linear transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix. We analyze the effect of an applied linear transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) at time \\\\( t \\\\), with \\\\( B \\\\) being another complex matrix.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) (where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( B \\\\) or \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces additional modifications through \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\), making the outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent not only on \\\\( A \\\\) but also on \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\). Each matrix impacts the system's evolution, influencing the path and final state of the system.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
