  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), noted as \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ g(t) \\\\} \\\\). We examine how convolution with another function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), whose Laplace transform is \\\\( H(s) \\\\), affects the system over time.\n\nGiven \\\\( F(s) \\\\) at some future time T, can we determine exactly the original functions \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\) if \\\\( F(s) = G(s)H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The factorization of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) into \\\\( G(s) \\\\) and \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is generally not unique unless additional information about \\\\( g(t) \\\\) or \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is given. Multiple pairs of functions could potentially yield the same product, hence the original functions cannot be uniquely determined from \\\\( F(s) \\\\) alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
