  "Problem": "Analyze the system governed by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We examine the role of applying the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), which transforms the spatial variable to a frequency variable.\n\nCan we deduce the initial function \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) from the state \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) at some time T > 0 without knowledge of the intervening Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "Given the invertibility of the Fourier transform and its preservation of information in a linear PDE setting, the evolution can be reversed using the inverse Fourier transform after applying the inverse of the linear operator \\\\( \\\\tilde{L} \\\\). Thus, even if the transform was initially unknown, it does not alter the backward traceability in the context of this linear PDE system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state of u(x, T) influences the initial function u(x, 0), and the Fourier transform of u(x, T) provides information about u(x, 0)."
