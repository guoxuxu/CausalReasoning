  "Problem": "Consider a system of complex functions where \\\\(z(t) = exp(i \\\\omega t)\\\\) with \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) being a real constant. We are examining how applying the Laplace transform affects the behavior of \\\\(z\\\\) over time and how interventions through different parameters might impact the eventual outcome.\n\nIf a modification by an exponential damping \\\\(g(t) = exp(-\\\\alpha t)\\\\) (where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a positive real constant) is applied at \\\\(t_1\\\\), does the end behavior of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at T > t_1 depend solely on \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) not on \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(g(t)\\\\) changes the system dynamics by introducing an attenuation factor, thus the final state at any T > t_1 will depend significantly on both \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\), due to their combined effect on the system’s output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
