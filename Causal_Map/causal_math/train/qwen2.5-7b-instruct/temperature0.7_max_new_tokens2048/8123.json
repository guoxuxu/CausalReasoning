  "Problem": "Assume that we have a system modeled by the equation \\\\( z(t + 1) = Mz(t) \\\\), where M is a linear operator represented by a matrix. We consider the modification caused by a transformation \\\\( h(z) = N^t z \\\\), where N is also a matrix representation of a linear operator.\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), a new function \\\\( i(z) = P^t z \\\\) (where P is another matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the system state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend only on M and not on N or P?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( i(z) \\\\) introduces additional dynamics to the system, thereby making the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on M as well as the transformations N and P. The effects are cumulative and dependent on the interaction between these matrices.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
