  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z = f(x) \\) defined in the complex plane, where \\( f(x) = \\int_0^x e^{t^2} dt \\). We are interested in the mappings done by \\( \\phi(z) = z^2 \\) and explore how these transformations affect \\( z \\) as \\( x \\) varies along the real axis.\n\nIf at a given \\( x = x_2 \\), a new function \\( \\psi(z) = z + c \\) (where \\( c \\) is a constant complex number) is applied as intervention, will the final \\( z(x_3) \\) for \\( x_3 > x_2 \\) depend only on the outcomes of \\( f(x) \\) and not on \\( \\phi \\) or \\( \\psi \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( \\psi(z) \\) alters the trajectory by adding the constant \\( c \\), which means the final state \\( z(x_3) \\) depends on \\( c \\) as well as the previous transformations \\( \\phi \\) and the integral transformation \\( f(x) \\). Thus, \\( z(x_3) \\) depends on all applied transformations, showing dependency beyond just \\( f(x) \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
