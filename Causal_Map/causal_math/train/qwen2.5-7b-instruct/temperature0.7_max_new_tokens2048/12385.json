  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We investigate the response of the system to an input transformation \\\\(h(u) = u \\\\cdot e^{Dt}\\\\) over time t, where D is a constant operator.\n\nCan the original state \\\\(u_0\\\\) at t = 0 be precisely determined from observing \\\\(u(t)\\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\(h(u)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without confirmation of the application of \\\\(h(u)\\\\), and given that the transformation modifies the initial state in a possibly non-reversible way depending on D and L, the original state \\\\(u_0\\\\) cannot be determined unambiguously from \\\\(u(T)\\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state u_0 directly influences the state u(t) at any time t. Applying the transformation h(u) indirectly affects u(t) through its influence on u."
