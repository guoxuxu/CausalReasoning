  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) in the complex plane, transforming its domain using a Möbius transformation given by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\frac{az + b}{cz + d} \\\\), where \\\\( a, b, c, \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\) are complex constants with \\\\( ad - bc \\\\neq 0 \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain point, an additional Möbius transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\frac{pz + q}{rz + s} \\\\) (where \\\\( p, q, r, \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\) are complex constants, \\\\( ps - qr \\\\neq 0 \\\\)) is applied as an intervention, will the outcome of \\\\( f \\\\) applied after \\\\( h(g(z)) \\\\) only depend on the transformations \\\\( h \\\\) and \\\\( g \\\\) and not on their order?",
  "Explanation": "Since Möbius transformations do not generally commute, the order of applying \\\\( h \\\\) and \\\\( g \\\\) affects the result. Thus, the outcome will depend on both the specific transformations and their sequence, altering how \\\\( f \\\\) maps the final value.",
