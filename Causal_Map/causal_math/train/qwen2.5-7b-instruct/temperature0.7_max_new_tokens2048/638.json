  "Problem": "Consider a fluid dynamics system where the velocity field is described by \\\\( v(x, t) \\\\) and evolves according to the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial v}{\\\\partial t} = -\\\\nabla p + \\\\nu \\\\nabla^2 v \\\\), where \\\\( p \\\\) is the pressure field and \\\\( \\\\nu \\\\) is the viscosity. We examine the effect of an applied external force \\\\( F(x, t) \\\\) represented by \\\\( F(x, t) = e^{Mt}x \\\\), where M is a constant matrix.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( v(x, T) \\\\) at t = T, can we determine if the external force \\\\( F(x, t) \\\\) was originally applied at t = 0 without further data?",
  "Explanation": "Without comprehensive information on the evolution history of the velocity field \\\\( v(x,t) \\\\), and lacking knowledge about the presence of \\\\( F(x, t) \\\\) or its properties, it's impossible to accurately deduce the original conditions, due to potential similarities with other forcing functions or natural system variations.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The external force F(x, t) influences the velocity field v(x, t) over time, which in turn determines v(x, T). Pressure p and viscosity ν also directly cause changes in the velocity field v(x, t)."
