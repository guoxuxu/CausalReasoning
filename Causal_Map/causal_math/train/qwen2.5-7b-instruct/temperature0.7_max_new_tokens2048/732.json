  "Problem": "Consider a controlled system described by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L u \\\\) where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear operator. Analyze the effect of applying a Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) on the system, with respect to the control variable \\\\( s \\\\).\n\nGiven the final Laplace transformed state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(s) \\\\), can we ascertain the exact nature of the intervention (change of operator from \\\\( L \\\\) to \\\\( L' \\\\)) purely based on the value of \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(s) \\\\) at some later time?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(s) \\\\) might meet different potential intervention pathways, and without additional information about the nature and timing of the change from \\\\( L \\\\) to \\\\( L' \\\\), or the details around system’s responses to these operators, several plausible interventions could result in similar or indistinguishable transformed states.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying a Laplace transform converts the state u(t) of the system under operator L to its frequency domain representation \\u0305u(s), while a change in the operator from L to L' changes the state to u'(t), which also transforms to \\u0305u(s). Thus, u(t) → \\u0305u(s) and u'(t) → \\u0305u(s), but the exact nature of the intervention from L to L' cannot be solely determined by \\u0305u(s) without additional information."
