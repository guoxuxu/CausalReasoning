  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear operator. We explore the impact of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) which converts function u(x, t) into its frequency components U(k, t).\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\), can we unequivocally determine the presence and effects of the intervention operator \\\\(M\\\\) just from this final state?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple interventions with different characteristics (different forms of \\\\(M\\\\) or timing \\\\(t_1\\\\)) might lead to the same or indistinguishably similar final states due to the complex interactions and reversibility issues in the frequency and spatial domains, making it impossible to uniquely identify the specific intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The final state u(x, T) influences the initial state u(x, t); the operator L affects the time derivative of u(x, t); M modifies L; u(x, t) transforms via the Fourier transform into U(k, t); and the Fourier transform converts u(x, t) into U(k, t)."
