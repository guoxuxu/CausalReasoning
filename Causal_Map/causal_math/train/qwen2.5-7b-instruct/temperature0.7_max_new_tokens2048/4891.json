  "Problem": "We consider a dual-space system where two functions are defined: \\\\( f(x) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} x(t) \\, dt \\\\) (Laplace Transform) and \\\\( g(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-2\\pi i t x} \\, dt \\\\) (Fourier Transform). Let \\\\( x(t) \\\\) represent an input signal evolving over time.\n\nAssuming an intervention using \\\\( g(x) \\\\) (Fourier Transform) at time t = t1 on the signal obtained from \\\\( f(x) \\\\), does the resulting function entirely reflect the properties and behavior of the original function \\\\( x(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform alters the domain and characteristics of the signal. When applied after a Laplace Transform, the combination can lead to a function that represents frequency components but ignores other aspects like amplitude decay, thereby not entirely reflecting the original function's properties.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
