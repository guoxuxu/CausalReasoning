  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit modeled by a set of linear differential equations with characteristics matrix \\\\(M\\\\). An input voltage \\\\(V(t)\\\\) is applied, modeled by the function \\\\(V(t) = e^{St}V_0\\\\), where \\\\(S\\\\) is a constant matrix. The response of the circuit, represented by the output current \\\\(I(t)\\\\), is initially determined by the impulse response matrix \\\\(H\\\\).\n\nAssuming an intervention occurs at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) with a new input voltage function modification\\\\(e^{Ut}V_1\\\\) (where \\\\(U\\\\) is another constant matrix), will the final output current \\\\(I(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 solely depend on matrix \\\\(M\\\\) and ignore the effects of \\\\(S\\\\) and \\\\(U\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(e^{Ut}V_1\\\\) introduces additional modifying factors, meaning the final output current \\\\(I(T)\\\\) depends on \\\\(M\\\\), \\\\(S\\\\), and \\\\(U\\\\). Each matrix interacts differently with the system dynamics, implying that the output will reflect these combined influences.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input voltage V(t) and the characteristics matrix M directly influence the output current I(t). The matrices S and U do not directly cause changes in I(t) after the intervention at t_1."
