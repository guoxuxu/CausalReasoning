  "Problem": "In a control system, consider a scalar linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = p z \\\\), where \\\\( p \\\\) is a constant parameter. The function \\\\( h(z) = \\\\sin(qz) \\\\) is applied, transforming the state, where \\\\( q \\\\) is another constant parameter.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we unequivocally determine the initial state \\\\( z(0) \\\\), especially whether it was transformed by \\\\( h(z) \\\\), based only on observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the non-linear transformation by \\\\( h(z) \\\\), reversing the evolution from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) to \\\\( z(0) \\\\) is not straightforward. Multiple initial conditions could lead to the same state at T, obscuring whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied initially.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The parameter p influences the state z(T) through the differential equation. The initial state z(0) directly causes z(T). The parameter q influences z(T) via the transformation h(z). The transformation h(z) affects z(T)."
