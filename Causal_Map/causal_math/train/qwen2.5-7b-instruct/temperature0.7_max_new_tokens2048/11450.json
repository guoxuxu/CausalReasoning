  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex value. We're interested in observing the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nAfter observing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we infer the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), the observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) does not provide clear information to uniquely backtrack to \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The effect of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) might alter both the magnitude and phase making it impossible to determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) precisely.",
