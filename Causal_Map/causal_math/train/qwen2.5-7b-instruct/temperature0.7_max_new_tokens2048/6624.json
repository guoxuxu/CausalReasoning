  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u) \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a differential operator. We evaluate the impact of an initial condition transformation described by \\\\( g(u) = \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}(e^{kt}\\\\mathcal{F}(u)) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is the Fourier transform and k is a constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( u(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what transformations were used (whether \\\\( g(u) \\\\), \\\\( h(u) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( u(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple transformations affecting the frequency domain in similar ways can lead to indistinguishable final states. Without additional information, the unique identification of specific transformations applied at different times is not feasible due to conflicting effects on different frequency components.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
