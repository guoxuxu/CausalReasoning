  "Problem": "Consider a system of differential equations defined by \\(\\dot{z} = Cz\\), where \\(z \\in \\mathbb{C}^n\\) and \\(C\\) is a complex matrix. We explore the effect of a Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\}\\) applied at a certain time.\n\nKnowing \\(z(T)\\) after it has evolved from a Fourier transformed state \\(\\mathcal{F}\\{z_0\\}\\), can we unambiguously reconstruct the original state \\(z_0\\) at \\(t = 0\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The effect of the Fourier transformation on \\(z_0\\), coupled with the dynamical evolution under \\(\\dot{z} = Cz\\) leads to complexities that prevent a unique reconstruction of \\(z_0\\) from \\(z(T)\\). Changes induced by the Fourier transform can mask or alter information about the original state \\(z_0\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
