  "Problem": "Consider a functional transformation governed by Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{f(x)\\\\}(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(x)e^{-ikx} dx \\\\). We study the effect of applying a function \\\\( g(x) = x \\\\cdot f(x) \\\\), which is the multiplication of f(x) by x, and its impact over the transformed function.\n\nIf a differential operation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dx} \\\\) is applied as an intervention after \\\\( g(x) = x \\\\cdot f(x) \\\\), does the resulting Fourier Transform solely depend on \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{f(x)\\\\}(k) \\\\) or does the effect of multiplication by x still influence the outcome?",
  "Explanation": "The additional differential operation will produce a complex modification of the Fourier Transform. While \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{f(x)\\\\}(k) \\\\) would guide the final outcome, the initial multiplication by x and subsequent differentiation would significantly alter the resulting Fourier spectrum, maintaining the influence of both operations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Multiplying f(x) by x to get g(x) influences the Fourier Transform, and applying the differential operator d/dx to g(x) further transforms its Fourier Transform, which depends on both the original Fourier Transform of f(x) and the effect of multiplication by x."
