  "Problem": "Evaluate the causal relationships in a complex plane system where the system response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is governed by the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(h(t)) = H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s^2 + bs + c} \\\\). We examine the system's behavior under modifications through convolution with a function \\\\( g(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nDoes applying the convolution \\\\( h(t) * g(t) \\\\) and then observing the evolution of the system’s Laplace Transform significantly alter the characteristics of the original \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) with \\\\( g(t) \\\\) translates to a multiplication in the Laplace domain, resulting in \\\\( H(s-a) \\\\). This forms a new system transform with shifted poles, thus fundamentally changing the system's frequency response and stability characteristics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The constants a and b directly influence H(s), while c also directly influences H(s). H(s) determines h(t), and g(t) convolved with h(t) produces a new system response h(t)*g(t), which has a new Laplace Transform new_H(s)."
