  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit where the input voltage \\( V(t) \\) is transformed by a Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) resulting in \\( V(s) \\). The transformed system is characterized by the impulse response function \\( H(s) = \\frac{1}{s + R} \\), where \\( R \\) is a resistance in the circuit. The transformation represents an operation over the input voltage.\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), a new component is added to the circuit thereby modifying \\( H(s) \\) to \\( H'(s) = \\frac{1}{(s+C)(s+R)} \\) (where \\( C \\) is an additional circuit element) as an intervention, will the new output \\( V_{out}(s) \\) for \\( s = R \\) depend solely on \\( R \\) and not on \\( C \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the new component \\( C \\) modifies the impulse response to \\( H'(s) \\). Consequently, the output voltage \\( V_{out}(s) \\) at \\( s = R \\) is a result of the interaction between the original impulse function \\( H(s) \\) and the new component \\( H'(s) \\), thus dependent on both \\( R \\) and \\( C \\), not just \\( R \\).",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input voltage V(t) transforms into V(s) via the Laplace Transform; V(s) and H(s) determine V_out(s); adding a component C modifies H(s) to H'(s); R and C affect H'(s), but V_out(s) at s = R depends primarily on R."
