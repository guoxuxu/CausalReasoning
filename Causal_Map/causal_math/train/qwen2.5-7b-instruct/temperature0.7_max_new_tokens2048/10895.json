  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{ f(t) \\} = F(s) \\) applied on a function F(s), and its subsequent inverse Laplace transformation to retrieve g(t). Analyze the influence of a linear differential operator \\( D \\), where \\( Dg(t) = g'(t) + ag(t) \\) (a is a constant), on the transformed function and its retrieval.\n\nIf an intervention with another differential operator \\( E \\), where \\( Eg(t) = g''(t) + bg(t) \\) (b is a constant), is applied during the process, does the end function \\( h(t) \\) only depend on the original function \\( f(t) \\) and not on the characteristics of \\( D \\) or \\( E \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( E \\) introduces additional changes based on second-order derivatives and scaling by b, affecting the final output \\( h(t) \\). Together with \\( D \\), both transformations significantly alter the function within the Laplace domain, impacting the final inverse transform results beyond just the influence of \\( f(t) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The differential operator D influences g(t) by changing its first derivative and value, while E influences g(t) by changing its second derivative and value. The Laplace transform of g(t) results in G(s), which then undergoes further transformation resulting in H(s). The final function h(t) depends on the transformations applied to g(t) through D and E."
