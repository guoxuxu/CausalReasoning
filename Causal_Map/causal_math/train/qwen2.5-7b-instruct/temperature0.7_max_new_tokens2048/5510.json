  "Problem": "Evaluate the causal relationships in a complex plane system where the system response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is governed by the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(h(t)) = H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s^2 + bs + c} \\\\). We examine the system's behavior under modifications through convolution with a function \\\\( g(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nCan the original system response \\\\( H(s) \\\\) be accurately deduced by analyzing the transform \\\\( H(s-a) \\\\) without knowing the specific function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) used for convolution?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of \\\\( a \\\\) from the function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), it is impossible to correctly revert \\\\( H(s-a) \\\\) back to \\\\( H(s) \\\\) because the shift amount \\\\( a \\\\) is unknown; hence determining the characteristics of the original system function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) becomes infeasible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
