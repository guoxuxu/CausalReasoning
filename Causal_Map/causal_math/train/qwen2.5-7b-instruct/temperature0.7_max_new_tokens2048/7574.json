  "Problem": "Assume a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), with P being a constant complex number. Consider the Beta transformation defined as \\\\( h(z) = z \\\\cdot e^{Qt} \\\\), where Q is another constant complex number.\n\nAfter observing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine the exact original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces an ambiguity in retracing the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\). Without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, the multiplication by \\\\( e^{QT} \\\\) can significantly alter the initial condition in such a way that it becomes non-recoverable simply by observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z at time T (z(T)) depends on the initial value of z (z(t)), the rate of change of z (dz/dt), and the transformation h(z). The application of h(z) modifies z over time."
