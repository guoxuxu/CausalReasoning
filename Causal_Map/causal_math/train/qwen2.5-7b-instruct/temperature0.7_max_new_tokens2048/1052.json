  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = D\\\\nabla^2 z \\\\), where D is the diffusion constant. Consider the effect of applying a transformation using a Laplace transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\), which alters the initial condition by a function \\\\( h(s) \\\\) in the transform space.\n\nGiven the function's state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it feasible to determine exactly which transformations (\\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\) or both) were applied during the evolution solely based on the end behavior of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to multiple possible combinations of transformations (original and inverse) that could lead to the same state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), and the intrinsic characteristics of transforms affecting the diffusion behavior differently, it is impractical to ascertain the precious transformations just from the final state without additional context or data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "D → ∂z/∂t; ∇²z → ∂z/∂t; z(t) → z(T); z(t) → h(s); h(s) → z(T); z(T) → feasibility_of_determination",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The diffusion constant D affects the rate of change of z with respect to time (∂z/∂t), and the Laplacian of z (∇²z) also affects ∂z/∂t. The initial condition z(t) transforms to h(s) via the Laplace transform, and this transformed condition influences z(T). Given z(T), it may be possible to infer the applied transformations (the Laplace or inverse Laplace transform or both) that led to this end behavior."
