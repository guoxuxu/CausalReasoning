  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit where the output voltage \\\\( V(t) \\\\) across a capacitor depends on the input current \\\\( I(t) \\\\). The relationship between input and output is governed by the differential equation \\\\( V'(t) = \\\\frac{1}{C}I(t) - \\\\frac{1}{RC}V(t) \\\\), where R is the resistance, and C is the capacitance. We examine scenarios where a Laplace transform operation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( I(t) \\\\) to analyze the system.\n\nIf the input current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) is transformed by a Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(I)(s) \\\\) to analyze the system, and then \\\\( V(t) \\\\) evolves according to the original differential equation without further intervention, will the in-circuit behavior of \\\\( V(t) \\\\) match the analysis?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the Laplace transform to the input current for analysis does not alter the physical current entering the circuit. Thus, real-time behavior of \\\\( V(t) \\\\) will not be affected by this mathematical operation, but the analytical solutions might differ if used to predict physical responses without considering inverse transformations or initial conditions correctly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input current I(t) directly influences the rate of change of output voltage V'(t) and also directly affects V(t) through the differential equation. The capacitance C and resistance R both directly affect V(t). Applying the Laplace transform to I(t) allows for the analysis of V(t) in the frequency domain, but the in-circuit behavior of V(t) will match the analysis if the system's initial conditions and parameters are consistent."
