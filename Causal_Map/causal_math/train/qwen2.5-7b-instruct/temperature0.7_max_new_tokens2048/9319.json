  "Problem": "Consider a linear system of equations represented by \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), where A is a constant matrix and b is a vector. We explore the influence of a transformation defined by the function \\\\(f(x) = Mx\\\\), where M is an invertible matrix, on the solution x.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), a new function \\\\(g(x) = Nx\\\\) (where N is another invertible matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\(x(T)\\\\) for T > \\\\(t_1\\\\) still satisfy \\\\(Ax = b\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since N is invertible and the original equation is \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), applying N to any valid solution at any point in time retains its validity as a solution. Even with the intervention, the fundamental nature of the matrix equation \\\\(Ax = b\\\\) means any transformed solution via invertible matrices remains a solution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of f(x) and g(x) transforms x, with A mapping x to Ax and b being equal to Ax. An intervention at t1 with g(x) changes x but the endpoint x(T) must still satisfy Ax = b if no other transformations intervene."
