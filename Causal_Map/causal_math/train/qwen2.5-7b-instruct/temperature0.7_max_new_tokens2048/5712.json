  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution in a material is modeled by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k \\\\Delta u \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal conductivity and \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) is the Laplacian operator. We investigate the effect of an external heat source, which is modeled as \\\\( h(x, t) \\\\), added to specific points in the material at time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nKnowing the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we accurately identify the specific interventions made (either \\\\( h(x, t) \\\\) or \\\\( j(x, t) \\\\) or both) throughout the evolution of the system?",
  "Explanation": "Given the end-state temperature distribution, multiple combinations of heat sources and their intensities might yield similar distributions due to superposition and diffusion effects. It is therefore impossible to deduce from \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) alone whether \\\\( h(x, t) \\\\), \\\\( j(x, t) \\\\), or both were applied, and in what manner.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
