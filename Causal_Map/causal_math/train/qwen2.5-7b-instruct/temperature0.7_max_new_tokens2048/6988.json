  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical setup where an initial complex function \\\\( z(s) \\\\) undergoes a series of transformations defined by the Laplace Transform followed by an Inverse Laplace Transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\) respectively. The transformations affect the function over the complex plane based on transformation parameters.\n\nCan the precise nature of the intervention (specifically the parameter \\\\( a \\\\) in \\\\( z^*(s) = e^{at} \\\\)) be determined merely by analyzing the final output of \\\\( z(s) \\\\) after all transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the precise value of \\\\( a \\\\) or even confirming its usage simply based on the final function form can be challenging without additional information. The effects on \\\\( z(s) \\\\) due to the exponential term might mimic or overlap with other potential transformations, making it difficult to pinpoint \\\\( a \\\\) exclusively.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The parameter a influences z*(s), which in turn affects z(s), and ultimately impacts the final output."
