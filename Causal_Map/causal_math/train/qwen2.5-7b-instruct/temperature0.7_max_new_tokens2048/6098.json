  "Problem": "Consider the solution to the Laplace equation in a rectangular domain, governed by \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 f = 0\\\\). We examine the effect of applying a Fourier transform to the boundary conditions of the domain. Let the boundary conditions change from function \\\\(g(x, y)\\\\) to \\\\(h(x, y) = g(x, y) + e^{kx}\\\\), where `k` is a constant.\n\nCan the original boundary condition \\\\(g(x, y)\\\\) be precisely determined by observing the solution inside the domain, when the known boundary condition used was \\\\(h(x, y)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Observing the interior solution only provides information that matches the effect of the applied boundary condition \\\\(h(x, y)\\\\). Without additional interventions or inverse transformations, the original boundary function \\\\(g(x, y)\\\\) cannot be uniquely isolated or deduced from the modified solution as the added \\\\(e^{kx}\\\\) component blends indistinguishably into the overall solution.",
