  "Problem": "Let's consider the probability density function \\( p(z) \\) that describes the distribution of a random variable \\( Z \\) undergoing the Fourier Transform \\( \\hat{p}(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty p(z)e^{-i\\omega z} dz \\). We investigate how transformations in the time domain and frequency domain affect this PDF.\n\nIf \\( p(z) \\) is modified to \\( q(z) = p(z - a) \\) for a shift \\( a \\), and then undergoes a Fourier Transform, will \\( \\hat{q}(\\omega) \\) at frequency \\( \\omega \\) be the same as \\( \\hat{p}(\\omega) \\) without the shift?",
  "Explanation": "The shift transformation \\( q(z) = p(z - a) \\) in the time domain corresponds to a phase shift in the frequency domain. Specifically, \\( \\hat{q}(\\omega) = e^{-i\\omega a} \\hat{p}(\\omega) \\), which means the Fourier Transform is multiplied by a phase factor that depends on \\( a \\) and \\( \\omega \\), altering the original transform \\( \\hat{p}(\\omega) \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Shifting the probability density function p(z) by a results in a new function q(z) which, when transformed, yields a shifted Fourier transform hat{q}(ω) that is equivalent to hat{p}(ω) shifted by -a."
