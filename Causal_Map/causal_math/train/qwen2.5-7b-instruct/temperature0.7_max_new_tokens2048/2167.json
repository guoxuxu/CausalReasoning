  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iωt} \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( ω \\\\) is a constant real number. The transformation applied on this function is given by \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\), where n is a fixed positive integer. We investigate the impact of this transformation on the function's behavior.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^m \\\\) (where m is another positive integer) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on ω and not on n or m?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) further alters the function's form, specifically changing the effective power to \\\\( nm \\\\). Consequently, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will not only depend on ω but also on the interplay and cumulative effect of both n and m.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z(T) depends on ω and T, but not directly on n or m. Applying transformations f(z) and g(z) at different times introduces intermediate states z(T_1) that are influenced by n and m, respectively, but the final state z(T) for T > T_1 is determined solely by the initial condition z(t_1) and the frequency ω."
