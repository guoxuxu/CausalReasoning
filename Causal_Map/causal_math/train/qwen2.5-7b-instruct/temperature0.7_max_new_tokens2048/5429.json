  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature change \\\\( \\\\Delta T \\\\) in a body is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d\\\\Delta T}{dt} = -k\\\\Delta T \\\\), where k is a positive constant. We examine the effect of an external heating process described by \\\\( h(t) = e^{At}\\\\Delta T_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( \\\\Delta T_0 \\\\) is the initial temperature difference.\n\nIf the external heating process \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is applied initially and then the system is allowed to evolve under the natural cooling process without further intervention, will the temperature difference \\\\( \\\\Delta T(t) \\\\) at time t = T be equivalent to just cooling the body from \\\\( \\\\Delta T_0 \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\frac{d\\\\Delta T}{dt} = -k\\\\Delta T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The external heating process modifies the initial state by increasing the temperature exponentially at the start, hence changing the trajectory of \\\\( \\\\Delta T(t) \\\\) over time. The effect of \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) essentially re-scales the initial condition, resulting in a different temperature at time T compared to natural cooling only.",
