  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( z'(t) = iz(t) \\\\). This differential equation describes a rotation in the complex plane. The function transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\), where k is a real constant, is analyzed over time t.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention functional transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{-kt}z \\\\) (where k is the same real constant) is applied, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on i and not on k?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) = e^{-kt}z \\\\) counteracts the initial transformation, potentially nullifying it. The effect at time T therefore still depends on the values of k applied initially and during the intervention, affecting both the magnitude and phase of \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
