  "Problem": "Explore the relationships in a mathematical model where the periodic function \\\\( x(t) = cos(\\\\omega t) \\\\) is transformed using a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\), defined by the integral transform \\\\( L\\\\{x(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}x(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are constants.\n\nGiven the transformed output, can you uniquely determine the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of the original function \\\\( cos(\\\\omega t) \\\\) without knowing the value of \\\\( s \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transform output depends on both the decay factor \\\\( s \\\\) and the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Without the specific value of \\\\( s \\\\), the exact frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) cannot be isolated since multiple combinations of \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) could produce similar transform characteristics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The cosine function x(t) is transformed into L{x(t)} by the linear operator L, which depends on the constant s. The frequency ω of x(t) influences the form of x(t) but does not directly affect the transformation result L{x(t)} without knowledge of s."
