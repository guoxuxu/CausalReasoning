  "Problem": "Consider the equation \\\\( u(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-zt} x(t) dt \\\\), which is a Laplace transform of a function \\\\( x(t) \\\\). Explore how modifying the original function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) affects the transform, and consider the impacts of two types of modifications: multiplication by a scalar function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and addition of another function \\\\( w(t) \\\\).\n\nIf an external function \\\\( w(t) \\\\) is added to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at a specific time to modify it into \\\\( y(t) = x(t) + w(t) \\\\), and this scenario is analyzed through its Laplace transform, does \\\\( u_y(z) \\\\) (the transform of \\\\( y(t) \\\\)) equal the sum of the transforms of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) \\\\) (i.e., \\\\( u_x(z) + u_w(z) \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "The linearity property of the Laplace transform implies that the transform of a sum is the sum of the transforms. Therefore, the modification of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) by adding \\\\( w(t) \\\\) results in a transform that is exactly the sum of their individual transforms.",
