  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution in a rod over time is modeled by the heat equation \\\\(u_t = k u_{xx}\\\\), where \\\\(u_t\\\\) is the time derivative of temperature, \\\\(u_{xx}\\\\) is the second spatial derivative, and \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We explore the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) to the initial temperature distribution, particularly how this transform impacts the system dynamics.\n\nIf, at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an inverse Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\\\) is applied as an intervention and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\(u_t = k u_{xx}\\\\), will the temperature profile at \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the original Fourier transform or also on the inverse applied?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\\\) modifies the state of the system again, possibly restoring or altering details of the original spatial temperature distribution. This makes the final state \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) dependent not only on the original Fourier transform but also significantly on the inverse transform process applied mid-evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial temperature distribution directly influences the temperature profile. Applying a Fourier transform to the initial temperature distribution results in a transformed temperature distribution. An inverse Fourier transform further modifies the transformed temperature distribution, which then influences the temperature profile."
