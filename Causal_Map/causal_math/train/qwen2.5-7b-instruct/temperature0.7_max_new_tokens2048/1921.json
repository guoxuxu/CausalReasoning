  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real number, representing angular frequency. The impact of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) dt \\\\) is analyzed over the interval [0, T].\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is initially set and evolves naturally according to its defining equation up to time T, will \\\\( T(z) \\\\) be zero for any T if no external modification is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), we find that \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-i\\\\omega t}e^{i\\\\omega t} dt = \\\\int_0^T dt = T \\\\). This clearly shows that the integral transformation does not inherently lead to zero; however, due to the periodic nature and the orthogonality of the exponential functions over the interval, the result actually evaluates to 0 only in specific cases like \\\\(\\\\omega T = 2\\\\pi k\\\\) for integer k.",
