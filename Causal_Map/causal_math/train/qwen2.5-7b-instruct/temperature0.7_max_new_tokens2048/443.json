  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. Investigate the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) \\\\) and then studying its behavior under this transformation.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new operator \\\\( M \\\\) is applied as an intervention in the frequency domain, will the endpoint \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( L \\\\) and not on the Fourier transform or \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a new operator \\\\( M \\\\) as an intervention in the frequency domain affects how the transformed state evolves. Thus, the endpoint \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,T) \\\\) will be dependent on both the initial Fourier transform, the nature of \\\\( L \\\\), and the intervention by \\\\( M \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The change over time of u is caused by L; u transforms to F(u) via Fourier transform; applying M in the frequency domain changes F(u) to F(u)_T; F(u) directly influences F(u)_T."
