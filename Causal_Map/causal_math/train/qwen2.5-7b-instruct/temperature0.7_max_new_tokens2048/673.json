  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_t + vu_x = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( v \\\\) is a velocity constant. We are analyzing the effect of applying a Fourier transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} u(x,t) e^{-ikx} dx \\\\), on the solution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,0) \\\\) undergoes a time evolution according to the corresponding transformed equation without intervention, will the solution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at time T be identical to if \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) was evolved for time T under the original PDE?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform and its inverse are linear operations that preserve the structure of solutions through the convolution theorem. The evolution under the transformed equation \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,t) = \\\\hat{u}(k,0)e^{-ikvt} \\\\) directly corresponds to the characteristic lines of the original PDE, thus replicating the exact dynamic when transformed back.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "u(x,t) → u(x,T); hat{u}(k,0) → hat{u}(k,t); v → u(x,t); t → u(x,t); hat{u}(k,t) → u(x,t)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Fourier transform to the initial condition u(x,0) results in hat{u}(k,0), which evolves over time according to the transformed equation. This evolution of hat{u}(k,t) inversely transforms back to u(x,t) that evolves under the original PDE from u(x,0) over the same time period, thus u(x,T) derived from both methods should be identical."
