  "Problem": "Consider a controlled linear dynamical system defined by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx + Cu\\\\), where D is a matrix defining the system dynamics, C is the control matrix, and u is a control input function. To analyze the impact, we introduce an external transformation function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Mx} \\\\), where M is also a constant matrix that modifies the state x.\n\nIf an intermediate control change \\\\( u(t_1) \\\\) is applied at t = t_1, then another transformation \\\\( j(x) = e^{Nx} \\\\) (where N is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be solely determined by D and not influenced by M or N?",
  "Explanation": "The system's final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is influenced by the initial exponential transformation due to M, the dynamics matrix D, the control matrix C through changes in u, and the subsequent transformation due to N. Each of these components, especially the exponential transformations, contribute to the system's evolution and lead to a state at T that reflects this compounded influence.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
