  "Problem": "Imagine a function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the partial differential equation \\( \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t} + P(D)z = 0 \\), where \\( P(D) \\) is a linear differential operator. We study the effect of the Fourier transformation \\( \\mathcal{F}(z(t)) \\), which transforms \\( z(t) \\) into the frequency domain.\n\nIf \\( \\mathcal{F}(z(t)) \\) is computed at an initial time \\( t = 0 \\) and then \\( z(t) \\) is evolved based on its governing equation until \\( t = T \\), will the spectral distribution \\( \\mathcal{F}(z(T)) \\) be the same as if \\( z(t) \\) was directly evolved to \\( t = T \\) and then transformed?",
  "Explanation": "The linearity and time-invariance of the linear differential operator \\( P(D) \\) ensure that the Fourier transform of the solution at any time \\( t \\) can be derived directly from the Fourier transformed initial condition. The temporal evolution of \\( z(t) \\) and its subsequent transformation will yield the same result due to the compatibility of the Fourier transformation with linear time-invariant systems.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of z(t) according to its partial differential equation leads to changes in its state from t=0 to t=T, which in turn affects its Fourier transform. Directly evolving z(t) to t=T and then applying the Fourier transform yields the same spectral distribution as transforming z(t) at t=0 and then evolving it to t=T."
