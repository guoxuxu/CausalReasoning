  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( f(z) = e^z \\\\) and its related complex function transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\sin(z) \\\\). We examine the impact of these transformations on the integration path in the complex plane.\n\nIf we intervene by applying another transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\log(z) \\\\) mid-way during the integration of \\\\( g(f(z)) \\\\), will the outcome of the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C g(f(h(z))) dz \\\\) depend solely on \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and not on \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) = \\\\log(z) \\\\) introduces additional complexity to the integration process, affecting the resultant value of the integral. Each transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\) can alter the trajectory and the final outcome of the integral, making it dependent on all applied functions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation h(z) influences g(f(h(z))), which in turn depends on f(z). The outcome of the integral depends on f(z) through g(f(h(z))), but also indirectly on h(z) and g(z)."
