  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) mapping from the complex numbers to complex numbers. Let's evaluate transformations induced by this function in the context of signal processing, particularly using the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) of a function \\\\( g(t) = t \\\\), and apply \\\\( f \\\\) to the Laplace transformed function.\n\nKnowing the final output of a sequence of transformations and interventions, can we accurately conclude whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) or another transformation was applied after observing \\\\( f \\\\) was used on the end result?",
  "Explanation": "The final transformation result can be achieved through various paths of applying \\\\( f \\\\), \\\\( h \\\\), or other functions. The non-linearity and independence in function applications mean that the exact intervention sequence cannot be uniquely determined from the final output alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input signal g(t) is transformed into its Laplace domain representation L(g)(s), then this Laplace transform is squared by the function f(z) = z^2 resulting in f(L(g))(z), which can be further transformed by h(z) or another transformation."
