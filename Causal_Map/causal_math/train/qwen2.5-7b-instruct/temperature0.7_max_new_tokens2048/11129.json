  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function represents propagation in time under a harmonic oscillator dynamic with a certain frequency. We introduce an integral transform \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{i \\\\alpha s} z(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is another real constant.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) operates under the given dynamics without further intervention, will applying the transform \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) at \\( t = T \\) yield the same result as if no integral transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "When \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) is applied, it fundamentally changes the nature of the function into a cumulative integral mode which encapsulates the history of the function from 0 to T rather than just being a point evaluation at T. This integration process inherently yields different results from the original function at any t.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
