  "Problem": "Suppose we are examining a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s)\\\\), where \\\\(F(s)\\\\) potentially depends on parameter \\\\(a\\\\). We evaluate the system's behavior changes under the modification of \\\\(f(t)\\\\) by a function \\\\(g(t) = e^{at}f(t)\\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{g(t)\\\\} = F(s-a)\\\\), can we infer the original function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) accurately without knowledge of the modification by \\\\(g(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the modification by \\\\(g(t)\\\\), one cannot reliably deduce \\\\(f(t)\\\\) from \\\\(F(s-a)\\\\) alone as the shift induced by \\\\(a\\\\) is unknown, and could represent a myriad of possible functions and modifications.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function f(t) transforms to F(s) through the Laplace transform, and g(t) which is e^(at)f(t) transforms to F(s-a); knowing g(t) allows us to infer modifications to f(t) in the frequency domain."
