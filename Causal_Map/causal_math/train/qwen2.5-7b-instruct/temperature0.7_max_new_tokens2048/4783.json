  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z \\\\), respectively. The evolution of this function over time is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a constant complex-valued matrix. Study the influence of a transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\), where \\\\( Q \\\\) is a complex matrix.\n\nIf a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\) (where \\\\( R \\\\) is another constant complex matrix) is applied at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 still depend solely on \\\\( P \\\\) and not on \\\\( Q \\\\) or \\\\( R \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intermediate application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) shifts the trajectory of \\\\( z \\\\) again and makes the resulting state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on all three parameters: \\\\( P \\\\), \\\\( Q \\\\), and \\\\( R \\\\. This introduces additional complexity due to possible non-commutativity and differing effects of the transformations imposed by \\\\( Q \\\\) and \\\\( R \\\\) with \\\\( P \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
