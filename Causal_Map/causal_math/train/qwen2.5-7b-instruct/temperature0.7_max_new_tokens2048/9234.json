  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We examine the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) \\\\) applied to the function u(t, x) and investigate its evolution.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( u(t_0, x) \\\\) at time t = 0 after observing \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(t, x)) \\\\) at t = T, considering no knowledge of intermediate transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is invertible, and the linear evolution under \\\\(L\\\\) preserves the ability to reconstruct the original state from its transformed evolved state, allowing backward calculation to \\\\( u(t_0, x) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
