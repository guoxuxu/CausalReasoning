  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit consisting of an inductor and a resistor in series, subjected to an alternating current (AC) voltage source. The mathematical model is governed by the differential equation \\\\(L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t)\\\\), where L is the inductance, R is the resistance, and V(t) is a sinusoidal source voltage. To investigate the response, we apply a Laplace transform on the system.\n\nIf the input voltage \\\\(V(t)\\\\) is altered to a different sinusoidal function at time t = 0, then left without further changes, will the transformed current \\\\(I(s)\\\\) in the s-domain be identical to its original state before the change?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the input voltage alters the system's driving function, thus affecting the circuit's response as represented in the transformed domain. This leads to a different Laplace transform of the current, reflecting changes in amplitude and phase shift dependent on the new parameters of the voltage source.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
