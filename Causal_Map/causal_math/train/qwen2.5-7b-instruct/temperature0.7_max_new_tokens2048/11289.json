  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\), where C is a constant matrix. We're evaluating the effect of an integral transformation defined by the operator \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Dt}s ds \\\\) applied to a function z(t), where D is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) modifies the state by integrating an exponential transformation over time, which alters not only the scale but potentially the direction of the vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\). This results in a modified trajectory under the system \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\), making \\\\( z(T) \\\\) different than if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) had evolved without the transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the integral transformation T to z_0 at t=0 and allowing it to evolve under Cz results in the same z(t) at t=T as directly evolving z_0 under Cz from t=0 to t=T."
