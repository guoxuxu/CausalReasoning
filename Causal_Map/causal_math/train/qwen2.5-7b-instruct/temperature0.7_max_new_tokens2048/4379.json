  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(w) \\\\) which maps complex numbers under the transformation \\\\(z(w) = e^{iw}\\\\). We study its effects on waves modeled by the integral transformation \\\\(x(t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\pi}^{\\\\pi} z(w)e^{iwt} dw\\\\).\n\nIf during the wave propagation, an intervention in the form of an additional transformation \\\\(y(w) = e^{-iw^2}\\\\) is applied, does the alteration depend solely on the original transformation \\\\(z(w)\\\\) and not on the new transformation \\\\(y(w)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new transformation \\\\(y(w) = e^{-iw^2}\\\\) applied during the propagation introduces additional modifications to the frequency components. This results in an overall effect that is a product of both the original phase shift and the new phase modifications, leading to a wave form at time T that depends on both transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
