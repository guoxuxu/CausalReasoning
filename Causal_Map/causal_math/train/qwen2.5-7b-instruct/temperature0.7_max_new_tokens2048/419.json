  "Problem": "Let's examine the role of a control function \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) in determining the solution to the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + x\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0\\\\) under different scenarios.\n\nIf during the evolution an intervention modifies the PDE to \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + (x + 1)\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0\\\\) halfway through the time interval, will \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) solely depend on the initial condition \\\\( \\\\sin(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the characteristics of the PDE, introducing a different velocity field for the second half of the propagation. This shift alters the path the function takes and results in a final state being influenced by both the initial conditions and the nature of the intervening equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "u(x, t) → u(x, T); sin(x) → u(x, T); u(x, t) → u(x, T) when modified PDE applies",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The control function u(x, t) influences u(x, T). The initial condition sin(x) determines u(x, T) initially. When the PDE is modified halfway, u(x, T) depends on the control function u(x, t) under the new PDE."
