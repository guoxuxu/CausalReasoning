  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( h(z) = e^{kz} \\\\), where k is a complex constant. We examine the implications of applying the integral transformation \\\\( H(w) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} h(z) e^{-iwz} dz \\\\), where w is a real constant representing frequency.\n\nCan one confidently deduce the exact value of k by solely analyzing \\\\( H(w) \\\\) without additional information or context?",
  "Explanation": "The analysis of \\\\( H(w) \\\\) alone generally yields the magnitude and phase alterations induced by the exponentials but isolating the precise value of k, which might contain both real and imaginary parts, requires explicit knowledge of h(z)'s behavior or the setting (e.g., boundary conditions) under which h(z) operates.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
