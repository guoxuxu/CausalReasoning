  "Problem": "Consider the transfer function of a linear system represented by \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s^2 + as + b} \\\\), where a and b are constants. We investigate the system's response to complex inputs and the effect of a convolution operation with another function \\\\( G(s) \\\\).\n\nAfter observing an output that results from a convoluted input transformation with \\\\( G(s) \\\\), can we conclusively trace back to the original input waveform?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the original waveform from the output after convolution with \\\\( G(s) \\\\) is complex, as multiple different inputs might yield the same or a similar convolved response due to properties of convolution and the loss of specific wave characteristics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
