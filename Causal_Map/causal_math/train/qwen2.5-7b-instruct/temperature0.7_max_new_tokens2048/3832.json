  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\) of a function \\\\(f(t)\\\\), particularly under the influence of a derivative operation, defined by \\\\( g(t) = d^n(t) / dt^n \\\\) where n is a positive integer.\n\nKnowing the resultant \\\\",
  "Explanation": "The operations involved in transforming \\\\(f(t)\\\\) to the Laplace domain can overlap in effect and do not necessarily leave distinguishable signatures to indicate sequence, especially without explicit knowledge of how each operation was designed (e.g., limits of integration or orders of derivatives). Resultantly, the sequence of operations cannot be explicitly discerned from the final transform alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace transform of the nth derivative of a function g(t) directly influences its Laplace transform F(s), and similarly, the Laplace transform of a function f(t) directly determines its Laplace transform F(s)."
