  "Problem": "Consider a quantum mechanics problem where a wave function \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t)\\\\) evolves according to the Schrödinger equation with potential \\\\(V(x)\\\\). We examine the situation where an operator \\\\(\\\\hat{O}\\\\) acts on \\\\(\\\\psi(x, 0)\\\\) before evolution.\n\nGiven the wave function at a later time \\\\(\\\\psi'(x, T)\\\\), can we accurately infer whether the operator \\\\(\\\\hat{O}\\\\) was applied at \\\\(t = 0\\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The wave function at time \\\\(T\\\\), \\\\(\\\\psi'(x, T)\\\\), could result from different initial wave functions or operators due to the nature of quantum evolution. Without more context, especially regarding \\\\(\\\\hat{O}\\\\) and \\\\(V(x)\\\\), it's not possible to conclusively determine if \\\\(\\\\hat{O}\\\\) was applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial wave function ψ(x, 0) influences the wave function at later time ψ'(x, T) through the Schrödinger equation, and the operator \\(\\hat{O}\\) modifies the initial wave function ψ(x, 0). The potential V(x) also affects the wave function ψ(x, t) over time."
