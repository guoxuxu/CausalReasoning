  "Problem": "Investigate a complex function scenario, where the complex function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is defined by a Fourier transform of another function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), specifically \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} g(t) e^{-izt} dt \\\\). We examine the implications of changing the original function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) to \\\\( g(t) + \\\\delta(t) \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\) represents a delta function.\n\nGiven the Fourier transform \\\\( h(z) \\\\), can we determine if \\\\( g(t) \\\\) was modified by \\\\( \\\\delta(t) \\\\) or not?",
  "Explanation": "Although the Fourier transform of \\\\( \\\\delta(t) \\\\) modifies \\\\( h(z) \\\\) uniformly across frequencies, without specific information about the original \\\\( g(t) \\\\) or baseline measurements of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), we cannot uniquely determine whether the modification occurred.",

List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
