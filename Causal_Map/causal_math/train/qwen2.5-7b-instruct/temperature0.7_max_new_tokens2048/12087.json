  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution in a rod over time t is modeled by the heat equation \\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\), where k is the thermal diffusivity constant. We analyze the impact of applying a time-dependent heat source \\( S(x,t) = h(t) \\cdot \\cos(\\omega x) \\) along the rod.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\( u(x,T) \\) at t = 10, can we determine precisely whether the change in thermal diffusivity at t = 5 was the only intervention applied, based on the observed temperature distribution?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple interventions could potentially lead to the same observed temperature distribution at T = 10, such as different combinations of heat source functions or changes in thermal diffusivity at different times. The final temperature distribution alone does not uniquely identify the events or conditions leading up to it due to the variability and complexities in the heat transfer processes.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "A time-dependent heat source S(x,t) directly influences the temperature distribution u(x,t); the rate of change of temperature with respect to time u_t depends on the temperature distribution u(x,t); the thermal diffusivity k directly influences the rate of change of temperature with respect to time u_t."
