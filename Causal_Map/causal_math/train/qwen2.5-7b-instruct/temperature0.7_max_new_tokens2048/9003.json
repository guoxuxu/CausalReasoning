  "Problem": "Investigate a system governed by the complex function \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( z \\\\) represents the complex variable. Determine how transformations by function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bz} \\\\) at specific instances influence the behavior of \\\\( w(z) \\\\) over the complex plane.\n\nIf an intervention \\\\( h(z) = e^{Cz} \\\\) is applied at a point \\\\( z_2 \\\\), will the final form of \\\\( w(z) \\\\) at a later point \\\\( z_3 \\\\) be dependant solely on matrix A and not on B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and the initial transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) contribute additional dynamics to the function, leading to \\\\( e^{Bz_2}e^{C(z_3-z_2)}e^{Az_3} \\\\). As such, the outcome at \\\\( z_3 \\\\) depends on all matrices A, B, and C, and their interactions over the complex plane.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation by function w(z) determines its final form at z3, which can be influenced by previous transformations from g(z) and h(z). An intervention h(z) at z2 affects w(z) at z3, alongside the original influence of A."
