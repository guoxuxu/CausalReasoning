  "Problem": "Consider a physical system governed by the Laplace transform of a function f(t), given by F(s) = \\\\(\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt\\\\). The behavior of the system is also influenced by a Fourier transform transformation, defined by G(ω) = \\\\(\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-iωt}f(t) dt\\\\).\n\nGiven the resulting function after Fourier transformation G(ω), can we determine precisely what interventions or transformations (initial Laplace transform, filtering operation) were applied, solely based on the knowledge of G(ω)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of initial conditions and interventions may result in similar or identical Fourier transform outcomes due to the overlapping effects of time-scaling, frequency shifting, and other transformation properties. Consequently, it is impractical to uniquely ascertain the sequence or types of interventions exclusively from G(ω).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Fourier transform G(ω) and the Laplace transform F(s) both depend on the original function f(t), indicating that knowing G(ω) alone does not allow us to precisely determine the original f(t) or the specific transformations applied, as there could be multiple functions with the same Fourier transform. Similarly, F(s) also depends on f(t) but is applicable for t ≥ 0."
