  "Problem": "The scenario involves the eigenvalue problem in the evolution of a system under transformation. Given a complex function defined as \\\\( f(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\) where \\\\( z \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\) and \\\\( A \\\\) is a real matrix, we examine its effects on the dynamics modeled by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention using a second function \\\\( g(z) = e^{iCz} \\\\) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), is the state at time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) solely dictated by the matrix \\\\( A \\\\), independent of \\\\( A, C \\\\) in the functions \\\\( f \\\\) and \\\\( g \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{iCz} \\\\) introduces additional complexity, making the final state dependent on both the original matrix \\\\( A \\\\) and the new matrix \\\\( C \\\\). These transformations can interact in complex ways, potentially leading to various trajectories and outcomes at time \\\\( T \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state at time T is influenced by matrix A and affected by the intervention via function g(z), but the state at T is primarily dictated by matrix A."
