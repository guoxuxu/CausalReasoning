  "Problem": "Consider a control system where temperature regulation is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dT}{dt} = -k(T - T_{env}) \\\\), where \\\\( T \\\\) is the temperature, \\\\( T_{env} \\\\) is the environmental temperature, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a positive constant. We study the effect of a sudden shift in \\\\( T_{env} \\\\) modeled by the function \\\\( T_{env}(t) = T_{base} + H(t)S \\\\), where \\\\( H(t) \\\\) is the Heaviside step function, and \\\\( S \\\\) is a constant shift.\n\nGiven the observed equilibrium temperature \\\\( T_{eq} \\\\) at a long time after the temperature change, can we deduce the original environmental temperature \\\\( T_{base} \\\\) without knowing \\\\( S \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The relation between the original and altered environmental temperatures involves the shift \\\\( S \\\\), which needs to be known to accurately trace back to \\\\( T_{base} \\\\). Otherwise, multiple possible values for \\\\( T_{base} \\\\) could result in the same equilibrium temperature.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The environmental temperature T_env directly influences the system temperature T, and the base environmental temperature T_base directly influences the environmental temperature T_env through a shift S."
