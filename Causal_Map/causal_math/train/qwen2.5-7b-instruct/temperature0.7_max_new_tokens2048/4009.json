  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\(\\dot{x} = Dx\\), where \\(D\\) is a diagonalizable matrix. We investigate the effect of applying a transformation \\( h(x) = S^{-1}e^{Mt}Sx \\) where \\(M\\) is also a diagonalizable matrix and \\(S\\) is the matrix that diagonalizes \\(D\\).\n\nIf \\( h(x) \\) is applied to a vector \\( x_0 \\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\(\\dot{x} = Dx\\) without further intervention, will \\( x(t) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( x_0 \\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\(\\dot{x} = Dx\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( h(x) \\) modifies the initial condition \\( x_0 \\) to \\( S^{-1}e^{Mt}Sx_0 \\). Given \\( x(t) = e^{Dt}x_0 \\), when transformed by \\( h(x) \\), it becomes \\( x(t) = e^{Dt}S^{-1}e^{Mt}Sx_0 \\). \\( e^{Mt} \\) and \\( e^{Dt} \\) might not commute, resulting in a different final state \\( x(t) \\) for the same \\( t \\) value.",
