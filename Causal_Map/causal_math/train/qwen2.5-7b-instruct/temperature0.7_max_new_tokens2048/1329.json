  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We evaluate the effect of transformation by another function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) on the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 = e^{i0} = 1 \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) without further intervention, will the function value at time \\\\( t = \\\\pi \\\\) be the same as the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) transforms \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( f(z_0) = 1^2 = 1 \\\\). While the initial conditions remain the same, the square transformation could modify future states if applied differently; however, in this specific case where the initial condition and transformation align, the trajectories will coincidentally be the same because of the specific values of \\\\( z \\\\) and \\\\( f \\\\). This is more happenstance than a rule, as altering \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in any way generally changes the trajectory.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial position z(0) → z_0 influences the trajectory z_0 → z(t), which then determines the state z(t) → z(π) without transformation. Applying the transformation f(z) to z_0 results in a new state z_0 → transformed_z(π), whereas the original trajectory without transformation is described by z(t) → untransformed_trajectory."
