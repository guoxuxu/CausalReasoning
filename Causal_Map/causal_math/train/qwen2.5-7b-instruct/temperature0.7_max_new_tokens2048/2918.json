  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Az + B\\\\sin(\\\\omega t)z \\\\), where A and B are constants, and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the frequency of an oscillating term. We explore the influence of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) over time t, where C is also a constant.\n\nConsidering \\\\( z(t) \\\\) observed at t = T, can the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) be accurately inferred if it is unknown whether transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Lacking information on whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was involved, it is impossible to determine with certainty the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The (non-linear) influence of \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) on the system’s evolution obscures backwards calculation of initial conditions without this critical information.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z at time t (z(t)) directly influences its value at time T (z(T)). The parameter A directly causes changes in z(t). The parameter B and the frequency ω also directly cause changes in z(t). The constant C influences the transformation f(z), which in turn affects the value of z at future times (z(t+Δt))."
