  "Problem": "Consider a complex function mapping from the real numbers to the complex plane described by \\\\( z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are real numbers, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The function is subjected to a Laplace transform, which alters its behavior in the complex domain.\n\nIf an additional exponential factor, say \\\\( e^{ct} \\\\) where \\\\( c \\\\) is a real number, is applied at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) (as an intervention), will the transformed function's behavior still be accurately predicted by solely using the original parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the exponential factor \\\\( e^{ct} \\\\) modifies the original function to \\\\( e^{(a+c+bi)t} \\\\), which changes the outcome of the Laplace transform. This results in a shift in the complex plane frequency domain that the original parameters alone cannot predict.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z(t) is directly influenced by both a and b through the expression e^((a+bi)t), and the application of an additional exponential factor e^(ct) at t=0 modifies z(t)."
