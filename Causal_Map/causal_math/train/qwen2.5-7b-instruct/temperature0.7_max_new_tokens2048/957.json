  "Problem": "Consider a system represented by the stochastic process \\\\( X(t) \\\\) driven by the differential equation \\\\( dX = AX dt + BdW \\\\), where \\\\( W(t) \\\\) is a standard Brownian motion and A, B are matrices. Let's analyze the influence of a deterministic control policy \\\\( u(t) = Ce^{Dt}X(t) \\\\), where C and D are constant matrices integrated over a time interval.\n\nIf the initial state \\\\( X(0) = x_0 \\\\) is subject to evolution by \\\\( dX \\\\) without any control policy \\\\( u(t) \\\\) applied, will the expected state of the system \\\\( E[X(t)] \\\\) at time t merely depend on the matrix \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The expected state \\\\( E[X(t)] \\\\) primarily evolves according to the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) applied to \\\\( x_0 \\\\), as the expectation of the stochastic integral term involving \\\\( B \\\\) is zero. Thus, without intervention, the state depends directly on \\\\( A \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
