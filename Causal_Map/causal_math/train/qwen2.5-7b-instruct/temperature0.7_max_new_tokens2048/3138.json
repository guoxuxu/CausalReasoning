  "Problem": "Suppose we have a complex function \\\\( z = g(w) = e^{i\\\\omega t}w \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. This function is used to modify the initial conditions of a particle's state in a quantum system described by \\\\( \\psi(t) = U(t)\\psi_0 \\\\), where \\\\( U(t) \\\\) is a unitary time evolution operator.\n\nCan we determine the original state \\\\( \\psi_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( \\psi(T) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( g(w) \\\\) was applied at the outset?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of the phase factor by \\\\( g(w) = e^{i\\\\omega t}w \\\\) at the initial time could result in multiple potential initial states depending on the value of \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and the specific time of observation T. Determining \\\\( \\psi_0 \\\\) uniquely without knowing the phase manipulation is therefore impossible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Observing \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\) allows us to infer \\\\( \\\\psi_0 \\\\) through the inverse of the time evolution operator \\\\( U(T) \\\\).
