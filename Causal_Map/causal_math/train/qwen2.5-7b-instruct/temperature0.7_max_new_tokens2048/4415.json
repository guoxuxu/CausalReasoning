  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a differential operator. We investigate the role of a Fourier transform, defined by \\\\(F(u)(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx} u(x, t) dx\\\\), applied to the function u(x, t).\n\nIf at some time \\\\(t_1\\\\), an intervention via an inverse Fourier transform \\\\(F^{-1}(v)(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{ikx} v(k, t) dk\\\\) is applied, would the resulting state \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) for T > t_1 still retain the influence of the initial Fourier transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The subsequent application of an inverse Fourier transform does not negate the effects of the initial Fourier transform. Both transformations and the system's evolution under differential operator L combine, causing the final state at T to reflect modifications from both the initial Fourier action and the intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Fourier transform F to u results in a transformed function, and applying the inverse Fourier transform F^{-1} to this transformed function returns to the original function u. Therefore, the inverse Fourier transform retains the influence of the initial Fourier transform on the function u."
