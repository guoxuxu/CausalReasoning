  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear operator. We examine the effect of the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t)) \\\\) applied to the solution \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\) where x is a spatial variable.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) \\\\) (Fourier transform) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( u(T, x) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on L and not on the effects of the Laplace Transform?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the Fourier Transform introduces another layer of complexity, altering the state's spectral properties further. This means the final state \\\\( u(T, x) \\\\) relies on the compound effects of multiple transformations (Laplace and Fourier), affecting how the solution to the initial differential equation evolves.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Laplace Transform does not affect the dependence of the endpoint u(T, x) on the linear operator L. The Laplace Transform L directly influences u(t, x), and the Fourier transform at t_1 influences u(t_1, x), but u(T, x) for T > t_1 depends solely on L."
