  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) evolving over time \\( t \\) with \\( \\omega \\) a real constant. An operation \\( \\mathcal{T} \\) transforms \\( z(t) \\) into \\( z'(t) = \\mathcal{T}(z(t)) = z(t) + ce^{dt} \\) where \\( c \\) and \\( d \\) are complex constants.\n\nIf the function is further modified at time \\( t_1 < T \\) by another transformation \\( \\mathcal{U}(z) = e^{at}z \\), with \\( a \\) a constant, will the system at \\( T \\) reflect changes due solely to \\( \\omega \\) independent of \\( a \\), \\( c \\), and \\( d \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\( \\mathcal{U}(z) \\) means that \\( z'(t) \\) is now influenced by additional exponential scaling from \\( e^{at} \\), making the final state \\( z'(T) \\) dependent on \\( \\omega, a, c, \\) and \\( d \\). The effect at \\( T \\) clearly depends on all parameters, not just on \\( \\omega \\).",
