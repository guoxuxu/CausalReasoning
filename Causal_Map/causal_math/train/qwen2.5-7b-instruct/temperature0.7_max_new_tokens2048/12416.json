  "Problem": "Consider a system where the position of a particle is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -kx\\\\) with a given constant k. The influence of an external transformation defined by \\\\( h(x) = Ce^{Dt}x \\\\), where C and D are constants, is considered over time t.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied to a position \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -kx\\\\) without further intervention, will the position \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was just evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -kx\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) changes the initial condition by scaling and potentially shifting the phase of the position due to the exponential factor \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\). This alteration affects the trajectory and hence the position at any later time T will not be the same as evolving without the transformation.",
