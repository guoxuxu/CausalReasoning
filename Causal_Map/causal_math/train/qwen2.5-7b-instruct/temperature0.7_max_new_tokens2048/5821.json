  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{tA}x\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a diagonalizable matrix with complex eigenvalues and \\\\(x\\\\) is an initial complex vector. We investigate the effect of applying a linear transformation \\\\(T(z) = Uz\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\), where \\\\(U\\\\) is a unitary matrix.\n\nIf \\\\(T(z)\\\\) is applied initially to \\\\(x\\\\) so that the initial condition becomes \\\\(z_0 = Ux\\\\), then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Az\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\) equal \\\\(e^{TA}x\\\\) when calculated without the application of \\\\(T\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(T(z) = Uz\\\\) changes the initial state, which affects the entire evolution of the system under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Az\\\\). Since \\\\(U\\\\) is unitary, it preserves the norm but can modify eigenvector directions, thus leading to a different endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) compared to just evolving \\\\(x\\\\) under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Az\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the linear transformation T with unitary matrix U to the initial condition x results in z_0, which then evolves over time t under the dynamics defined by A to become z(T). The transformation T does not directly affect the evolution governed by A, so z(T) will be equivalent to e^(TA)x."
