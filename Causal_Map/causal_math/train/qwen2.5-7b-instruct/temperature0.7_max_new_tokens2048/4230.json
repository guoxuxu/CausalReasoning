  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\( u_t = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. The effect of a transformation given by \\\\( F(u) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(x,t)\\\\} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) denotes the Laplace transform with respect to time t) is studied.\n\nGiven the Laplace transformed function \\\\( F(u)(x, s) \\\\), can one precisely recover the initial function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) without knowing how the system evolved afterwards?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform \\\\( F(u)(x, s) \\\\) encodes the initial conditions and the subsequent evolution in a collapsed s-domain representation. Depending on L, certain information about the initial conditions might be irretrievably blended with the effects of the operator, which could make it challenging to uniquely determine \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace transform of the function F(u)(x, s) directly influences the recovery of the initial function u(x, 0), and the linear differential operator L directly causes the change in the function over time u_t."
