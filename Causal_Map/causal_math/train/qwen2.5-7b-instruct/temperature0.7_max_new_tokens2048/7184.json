  "Problem": "Assume we have a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the complex differential equation \\\\( z'(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency. The influence of the linear transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) being another real constant and \\\\( t \\\\) denoting time, is considered.\n\nKnowing only the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and the initial differential equation, can we determine exactly which transformations (i.e., \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were applied, and at what times?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping effects of exponential growth or decay and complex plane rotation can mask each other, making it computationally challenging to backtrack and determine the precise nature and timing of transformations based on the final state alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of z(t) over time is directly influenced by iω, which in turn causes changes in z(t). Additionally, the transformation e^(αt) directly affects z(t)."
