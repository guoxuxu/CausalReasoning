  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{iAt}\\\\) where \\\\(A\\\\) is a real constant matrix and \\\\(i\\\\) represents the imaginary unit. We analyze the integration transformation applied to this function over a period \\\\(T\\\\), defined by the integral \\\\( F(t) = \\\\int_0^T e^{iAt} dt \\\\).\n\nIf the function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is integrated from 0 to \\\\(T\\\\) without any functional modification, does this integration, \\\\( F(T) \\\\), represent the behavior of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) throughout the interval purely based on \\\\(A\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integration of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) from 0 to \\\\(T\\\\) inherently captures the cumulative effect of the exponential function governed by matrix \\\\(A\\\\), representing the aggregate effect of the function over the interval.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
