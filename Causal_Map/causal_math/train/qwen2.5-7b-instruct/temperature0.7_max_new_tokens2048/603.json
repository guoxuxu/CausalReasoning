  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function z defined over the complex plane, given by \\\\( z(w) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{aw^2 + bw} dw \\\\) where a and b are constants. We are interested in the causal influence of changes in parameters a and b, or transformations on w, on the resulting function values computed by z.\n\nIf at some intermediate time t1, a transformation on the variable w, defined as \\\\( w' = cw \\\\) for a constant c, is applied, will the resultant z(w) at time T be independent of the transformation applied at t1?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( w' = cw \\\\) affects the entire integration process by modifying the variable of integration. This scaling changes the nature of z(w) since the exponential terms inside the integral react sensitively to changes in w. Thus, z(w) at T depends on both the parameters a, b and the intermediate transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
