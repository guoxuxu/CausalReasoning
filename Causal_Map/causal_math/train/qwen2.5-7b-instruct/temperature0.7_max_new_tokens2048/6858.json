  "Problem": "Consider a function space transformation governed by integral transform \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) represents a function in time domain and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable. Analyze the effect of applying the inverse Laplace transformation on \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and compare it under different variations of function \\\\( f(t) \\\\).\n\nKnowing the transformed function \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s^2} \\\\), can we uniquely infer the original function \\\\( f(t) = t \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( t \\\\) is \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s^2} \\\\). If we observe \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s^2} \\\\), we can uniquely determine the original function as \\\\( f(t) = t \\\\) due to the uniqueness of the Laplace transform for causal systems.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
