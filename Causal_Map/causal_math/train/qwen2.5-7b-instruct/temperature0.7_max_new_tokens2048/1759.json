  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number. We examine the effect of a Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) on this function.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied as an intervention, and no further interventions are applied, will the transformed Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\tilde{z}(s) \\\\) depend solely on \\\\( i \\\\omega \\\\) and not on the nature of the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) alters the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in such a way that its subsequent evolution and its Laplace transform will depend on the nature of \\\\( f \\\\) and not just on \\\\( i \\\\omega \\\\), thereby affecting the outcomes and characteristics of \\\\( \\\\tilde{z}(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "i ω → dz/dt; f(z) = z^2 → z(t); z(t) → z^2; z^2 → Laplace transform; i ω → Laplace transform",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of \\( i\\\\omega \\) directly influences the rate of change of \\( z(t) \\), which through the transformation \\( f(z) = z^2 \\) affects the function \\( z(t) \\). The Laplace transform of \\( z(t) \\) depends on \\( i\\\\omega \\) but not on the specific intervention of squaring the function."
