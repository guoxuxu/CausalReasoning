  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\omega\\\\) is a fixed frequency. The effect of an integral transformation \\\\(T[f](s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt\\\\) is examined over this function, both with and without additional transformations.\n\nIf we apply a damping factor by transforming \\\\(z(t)\\\\) to \\\\(z(t)e^{-\\gamma t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\gamma >0\\\\) is a damping coefficient, and then compute \\\\(T[z](s)\\\\), will the transformation result depend only on the added \\\\(\\gamma\\\\) and not on \\\\(s\\\\) or \\\\(\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new transformation \\\\(T[z](s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} e^{i\\omega t} e^{-\\gamma t} dt = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-(s+\\gamma)t} e^{i\\omega t} dt = \\frac{1}{s+\\gamma - i\\omega}\\\\) shows that the result depends on \\\\(\\gamma\\\\), as well as \\\\(s\\\\) and \\\\(\\omega\\\\). Thus, all three parameters shape the transformation outcome.",
