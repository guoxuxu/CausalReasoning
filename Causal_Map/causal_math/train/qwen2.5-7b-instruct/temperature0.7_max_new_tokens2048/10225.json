  "Problem": "Consider a system influenced by the heat equation in a rod, described by \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\) where \\\\( u \\\\) represents the temperature, \\\\( t \\\\) is time, and \\\\( x \\\\) is the position along the rod. Analyze the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) with respect to \\\\( x \\\\) to the equation and the inverse transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\) after a specific time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf a Fourier transform of the initial condition \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) is taken at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\) without further intervention, will the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) be the same as if the initial condition was directly evolved?",
  "Explanation": "Taking the Fourier transform of the initial condition does not change the system's behavior under the heat equation. The transform and inverse transform act as mathematical tools without influencing the physical propagation process of heat in the rod.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial temperature distribution u(x,0) directly causes the temperature distribution u(x,t) at any later time t. Taking the Fourier transform of u(x,0) results in U(k,0), which then evolves over time to U(k,t). The inverse Fourier transform of U(k,t) leads back to u(x,t) at any time t. Thus, evolving the initial condition u(x,0) directly under the heat equation yields the same result as taking its Fourier transform, evolving it in the frequency domain, and then transforming back."
