  "Problem": "Consider a system managed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are solutions to coupled differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = ax - by \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = bx + ay \\\\), with constants a and b. We examine the effect of the Laplace transform on this system and how interventions using transformations affect the final results.\n\nCan we uniquely determine the original function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing its Laplace transform at a later time s = T without direct initial knowledge of \\\\( z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution of the complex function in the Laplace domain involves both initial conditions and the parameters a and b, thus observing its state at s = T doesn't uniquely dictate the initial function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without additional data on system dynamics and starting state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The constants a and b directly influence x(t) and y(t); x(t) and y(t) jointly determine z(t); z(t) at time t influences its Laplace transform at s=T; the Laplace transform at s=T can be used to estimate z_0."
