  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\). We examine the effect of a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) applied to the variable z in the complex plane over time t, where i is the imaginary unit.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{-iz} \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the output of \\\\( f \\\\) at T > t_1 depend only on the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and not on the transformations applied?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the state further, interacting complexly with \\\\( g(z) \\\\). For example, applying \\\\( h \\\\) after \\\\( g \\\\) could partially or fully undo or amplify the effect of \\\\( g \\\\), and the result of \\\\( f \\\\) will encompass effects of both transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation g(z) and h(z) both influence f(z). At time t_1, applying h(z) will change the value of z, which in turn affects f(z). The output of f(z) at T > t_1 depends on the cumulative effect of g(z) and h(z) on z."
