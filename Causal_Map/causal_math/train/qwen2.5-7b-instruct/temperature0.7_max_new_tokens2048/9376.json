  "Problem": "Consider a complex integral transformation of a function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) defined as \\\\( G(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}g(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable and the integral transformation is the Laplace Transform. We study the effect of a linear differential operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) applied to \\\\( g(t) \\\\) defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}g = \\\\frac{d^2g}{dt^2} - 2\\\\frac{dg}{dt} + g \\\\).\n\nGiven the Laplace Transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\) of the intervened function, can we unequivocally identify the sequence or types of operations applied (i.e., \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), \\\\( \\\\mathcal{M} \\\\), or both) just by examining \\\\( G(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the transformations’ properties and the potential for overlapping effects in the s-domain (non-uniqueness of differential operator effects), it's challenging to precisely decode from \\\\( G(s) \\\\) which operations were applied and in what sequence. The resultant Transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\) could fit multiple operational histories.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
