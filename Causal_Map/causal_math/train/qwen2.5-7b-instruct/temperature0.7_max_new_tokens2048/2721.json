  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency, and a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\\\( M \\\\). The system's evolution is examined under the impact of this transformation over time t.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( M \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the matrix \\\\( M \\\\) alters the initial conditions of the system, potentially changing the trajectory. Since \\\\( M \\\\) could introduce a phase and magnitude alteration, the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will differ unless \\\\( M \\\\) is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
