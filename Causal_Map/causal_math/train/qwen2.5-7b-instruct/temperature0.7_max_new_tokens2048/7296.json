  "Problem": "Consider a partial differential equation (PDE) given by \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator on function \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\). To analyze the system's behavior, we explore the effect of applying Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) to \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\), particularly focusing on the transformation over time.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}[u](k, T)\\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), \\\\(\\\\mathcal{G}\\\\), or both), solely based on the value of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}[u](k, T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations and their effects in the Fourier and spatial domain can overlap in ways that make it impossible to distinctly identify which interventions were applied just by observing the endpoint in the Fourier domain. Different combinations of operations and interventions could potentially result in the same or indistinguishably similar outcomes.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function u(x, t) changes over time due to the action of the linear differential operator L(u). Applying the Fourier transform F to u(x, t) results in F[u](k, T), which represents the transformed function at a specific endpoint."
