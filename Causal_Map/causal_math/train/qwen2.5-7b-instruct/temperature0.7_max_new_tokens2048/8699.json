  "Problem": "Consider a dynamic study involving a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) where A is a complex constant, applied to a complex variable z. We define a transformation using the inverse Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\) on this function and analyze various cases of causal inference.\n\nSuppose at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an adjustment or intervention is applied directly modifying \\\\( z \\\\) such that the new value becomes \\\\( z' = z + B \\\\) with B as another complex constant; will \\\\( y(t) \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) be dependent only on A and not on B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the function to \\\\( f(z') = e^{A(z + B)} = e^{AB}e^{Az} \\\\), thus altering not only the scale but potentially the growth rate and phase due to e^{AB}. Consequently, the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) now depends on both A and B.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Adjusting z to z' through addition of B directly influences y(t) in the time domain via the inverse Laplace transform, but the effect of B on y(t) is mediated by A. Therefore, y(t) depends on both A and the transformed z (which includes the impact of B)."
