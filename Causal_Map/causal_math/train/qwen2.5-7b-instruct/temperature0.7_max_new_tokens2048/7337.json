  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex number. We explore the impact of an integral transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(s-t)N}z(s) ds \\\\), where N is also a constant complex number.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( z_0(s) \\\\) on the interval [0, t] and left to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\) without further intervention, will the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T conform exactly to the evolution of \\\\( z_0(s) \\\\) directly under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\) for t > 0?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) alters the trajectory of the function from its original path by integrating modified versions of the past state influenced by N, thus affecting the future evolution of the function under M differently than if it had evolved solely under the original equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
