  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit governed by the differential equation \\\\( L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = E(t) \\\\), where L is inductance, R is resistance and E(t) represents a time-dependent electromotive force. Further, suppose that an operator \\\\( T \\\\) defined by multiplying the current amplitude by a scalar \\\\( k \\\\) is applied, and we explore how this affects the response of the system over time t.\n\nGiven the current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we infer the exact initial current \\\\( I_0 \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( T \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the operator \\\\( T \\\\) was applied (i.e., the modification by \\\\( k \\\\)), it is impossible to uniquely determine the initial current \\\\( I_0 \\\\). The current at any time could have been altered by the scalar multiplication, making exact back-calculation to \\\\( I_0 \\\\) uncertain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The electromotive force E(t), inductance L, and resistance R directly cause the current I(t). The operator T applied at time T causes a change in the current amplitude, which in turn affects the current I(T). The current I(t) at any time t leads to the current I(T) at time T."
