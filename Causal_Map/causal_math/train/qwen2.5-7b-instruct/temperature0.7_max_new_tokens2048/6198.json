  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u) \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. To analyze causal effect and intervention, we study the system's behavior under a transformation defined by \\\\( T(u) = e^{Mt}u \\\\), where M is a linear operator.\n\nCan we accurately determine the initial condition \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T, if we do not know whether \\\\( T(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Observing \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T does not allow us to accurately trace back to \\\\( u_0 \\\\) unless we know whether the transformation \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\) was applied. The transformation could have modified the initial state in a complex way, especially if the operators M and L interact in a non-trivial manner.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
