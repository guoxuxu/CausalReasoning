  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iAz + B \\\\cos(t)z \\\\), where A and B are constant real numbers. The study involves a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{-Ct}z \\\\) applied to \\\\( z \\\\), where C is also a constant real number.\n\nIf a new operation \\\\( k(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (D being another constant) is applied at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention, would the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T > t_1 rely only on the variable A, disregarding the impacts of B, C, and D?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( k(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) introduces additional complexity, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent not just on A but also on B, C, and D. Each of the terms contributes through their own exponential influence on the system's dynamics, impacting the ultimate path and final state at \\\\( T \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
