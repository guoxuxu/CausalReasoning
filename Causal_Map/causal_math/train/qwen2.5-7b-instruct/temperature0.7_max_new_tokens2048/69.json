  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow problem represented by the velocity field \\\\( \\\\vec{v}(x, y) \\\\) and governed by the Navier-Stokes equations. To analyze the system behavior, a transformation \\\\( g(\\\\vec{v}) = \\\\vec{v} + \\\\nabla \\\\phi \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) is a scalar potential function.\n\nIf \\\\( g(\\\\vec{v}) \\\\) is applied initially to the system, and then the system is allowed to evolve following the Navier-Stokes equations without further intervention, will \\\\( \\\\vec{v}(x, y, t) \\\\) at t = T exhibit the same behavior as if \\\\( \\\\vec{v} \\\\) was evolved directly under the Navier-Stokes equations?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of \\\\( \\\\nabla \\\\phi \\\\) modifies the initial velocity field, potentially altering both pressure and velocity distributions in the fluid. This change affects the evolution of the flow, leading to different flow characteristics at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation g(\\vec{v}) modifies the initial velocity field \\vec{v}(x, y), which then evolves over time according to the Navier-Stokes equations to produce \\vec{v}(x, y, t) at time t, leading to \\vec{v}(x, y, T) at time T. This differs from evolving the original \\vec{v} directly under the Navier-Stokes equations."
