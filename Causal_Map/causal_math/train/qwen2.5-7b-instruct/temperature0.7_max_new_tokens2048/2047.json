  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation given by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a Hermitian matrix and \\\\( x_0 \\\\) is a fixed complex vector. The transformation evolves a quantum state in time t in a closed system.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a perturbative Hamiltonian \\\\( H' \\\\) described by the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{iH't} \\\\) acts on the system, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be unaffected by \\\\( H' \\\\) at time T > t_1?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by a perturbative Hamiltonian \\\\( H' \\\\) introduces a new transformation factor, modifying the system's trajectory from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T. This changes the resultant state due to the new exponential operator acting on the state, manifesting in a changed evolution that differs from the original unperturbed path.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state at time t1, influenced by the perturbative Hamiltonian H', leads to a state at time T; the original evolution from z(t1) to z(T) is affected by the additional action of H' if T > t1."
