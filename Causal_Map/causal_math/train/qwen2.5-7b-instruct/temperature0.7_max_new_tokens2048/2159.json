  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) subjected to a Fourier transform, which shifts the frequency domain representation. Analyze the effect of adding an exponential decay \\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\) where \\( \\alpha \\) is a positive constant.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\( z(t) \\) by a different exponential decay \\( e^{-\\beta t} \\) (where \\( \\beta \\neq \\alpha \\)) at time \\( t_1 \\), will the final Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) for \\( t \\to \\infty \\) be independent of the initial \\( \\alpha \\)-decay?",
  "Explanation": "The final Fourier transform will exhibit characteristics influenced by both exponential decays \\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\) and \\( e^{-\\beta t} \\). The effects of these alterations do not cancel out but rather accumulate, leading to compounded shifts and broadening in the frequency spectrum.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of alpha influences the type of decay applied to z(t), and similarly, beta influences the type of decay applied after the intervention. The type of decay affects the final Fourier transform of z(t) as t approaches infinity, so alpha and beta both contribute to the final Fourier transform independently."
