  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\), where z is a complex variable and A is a constant matrix. The function acts on an initial complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and the system evolves under the transformation \\\\( z(t) = f(t)z_0 \\\\)\n\nIf \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at time t = 0 and allowed to evolve without further intervention, will the vector \\\\( z(T) \\\\), at time T, be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was evolved to time T under \\\\( z(t) = f(t)z_0 \\\\) starting from t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Since the function \\\\( f(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) describes the evolution of the system over time by its very definition, the application of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) at time t = 0 and allowing it to evolve naturally without intervention will indeed result in \\\\( z(T) \\\\) being exactly as it is defined by the transformation \\\\( z(t) = f(t)z_0 \\\\). The evolution is deterministic and solely dependent on \\\\( f(t) \\\\).",
