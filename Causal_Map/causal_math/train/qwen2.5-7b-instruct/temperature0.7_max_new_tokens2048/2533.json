  "Problem": "Consider complex function \\\\(g(z) = e^{\\lambda z}\\\\) where \\\\(z\\\\) represents complex numbers and \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) is a complex constant. We examine how integral transformations, specifically Laplace Transform, modify this function and impact the final output when the independent variable \\\\(z\\\\)'s real part changes.\n\nIf \\\\(g(z)\\\\) is subject to a Laplace Transform without other interventions, will the transformed function \\\\(G(s)\\\\) have its poles determined solely by \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) and Independent of the imaginary part of \\\\(z\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform of \\\\(g(z)\\\\) will be \\\\(G(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-\\\\lambda}\\\\), whose poles are exclusively dependent on \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) and not influenced by the imaginary component of \\\\(z\\\\), highlighting that the function's essential characteristics in the s-domain depend solely on \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
