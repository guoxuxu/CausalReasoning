  "Problem": "In this scenario, we consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), where \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). This scenario investigates how the causal relationship between functions and their transforms behaves with or without interventions in the form of function modification.\n\nIf a constant \\\\( c \\\\) is added to the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to form a new function \\\\( g(t) = f(t) + c \\\\), will the Laplace transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\) of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) at \\\\( s \\\\) be equivalent to the Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) plus \\\\( \\\\frac{c}{s} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "According to the linearity property of the Laplace transform, \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t) + c\\\\}(s) = F(s) + \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{c\\\\}(s) = F(s) + \\\\frac{c}{s} \\\\). Thus, adding a constant to the function forwards its effect linearly to the transform.",
