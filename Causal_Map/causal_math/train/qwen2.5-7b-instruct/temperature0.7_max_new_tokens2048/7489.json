  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a diagonalizable matrix. We introduce an operator transformation \\\\( F(x) = Ax \\\\), where A is another matrix, and analyze its effect on the system over a period of time t.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( F(x) \\\\) is applied to an initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at time t = 0 and the system is then allowed to evolve according to \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\) without any further intervention, will the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at time t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( F(x) = Ax \\\\) changes the initial conditions of the system by transforming \\\\( x_0 \\\\) into \\\\( Ax_0 \\\\). The evolution from \\\\( Ax_0 \\\\) under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\) generally differs from that of \\\\( x_0 \\\\) unless A commutes with the exponential of M, that is, unless \\\\( AM = MA \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "F(x_0) → x(t); x_0 → x(t); Mx → x(t+dt)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation F(x_0) results in a new state x(t), which is different from directly evolving the initial state x_0 under the dynamics Mx. The state x(t) changes continuously according to Mx over time dt."
