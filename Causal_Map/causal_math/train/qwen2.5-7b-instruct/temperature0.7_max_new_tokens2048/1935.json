  "Problem": "Consider a dynamical system where the stock price follows a stochastic differential equation \\\\( dS = S(\\\\mu dt + \\\\sigma dW) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\) is the drift rate, \\\\( \\\\sigma \\\\) the volatility, and \\\\( dW \\\\) a Brownian motion increment. We apply a Fourier transform \\\\( F(f) \\\\) to transform the probability density function of the stock price.\n\nSuppose an additional operation \\\\( e^\\\\{-\\\\lambda^2 t\\\\} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a parameter, is applied at time t = t1 as an intervention in the frequency domain, will the modified characteristic function at t = T depend primarily on the stochastic dynamics \\\\( dS \\\\) without significant influence from the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the operation \\\\( e^\\\\{-\\\\lambda^2 t\\\\} \\\\) modifies the characteristic function further by damping certain frequencies. This change affects the probability distribution over time, rendering the endpoint characteristics at T dependent not just on the natural stochastic dynamics but also significantly influenced by the specific nature of the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "dS → F(f); dS → modified characteristic function; F(f) → modified characteristic function",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The stochastic dynamics dS influences the Fourier transform F(f), which in turn affects the modified characteristic function. The intervention e^{-λ²t} primarily modifies the characteristic function through its effect on F(f)."
