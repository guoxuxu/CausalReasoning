  "Problem": "Consider a stochastic process where the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) evolves according to the stochastic differential equation \\\\( dx = Ax \\\\, dt + B \\\\, dW \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are matrices and \\\\( dW \\\\) refers to a Wiener process increment. An operator \\\\( T_t \\\\) defined by the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) where \\\\( C \\\\) is constant is considered as a transformation.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T_t(x) \\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and the process evolves under the given stochastic differential equation, will the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) be identical to the evolution that starts from \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without applying \\\\( T_t \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the transformation \\\\( T_t(x) = e^{Ct}x \\\\) to the initial state modifies the starting point of the stochastic process. As a result, the influence of the transformation matrix exponential along with the stochastic nature of the evolution makes the final state different from what it would be starting directly from \\\\( x_0 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state x(t) evolves over time t to become x(T). Applying the transformation T_t to the initial condition x_0 results in a new initial condition x'(0), which then evolves to x'(T) under the same stochastic differential equation."
