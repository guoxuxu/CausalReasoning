  "Problem": "Consider the effect of a Fourier Transform on a given function \\\\( g(t) = e^{-at^2} \\\\), where \\\\( a > 0 \\\\) is a constant. The Fourier Transform of this function is defined as \\\\( G(f) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-at^2} e^{-i2\\\\pi ft} dt \\\\). Analyze the outcomes of various implementation scenarios and their reverse causality.\n\nGiven \\\\( G(f) \\\\) after the application of an unknown modulating function \\\\( m(t) = e^{ct} \\\\), can we deduce both the original function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and the constant \\\\( c \\\\) solely from \\\\( G(f) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting Fourier Transform \\\\( G(f) \\\\) is a convolution of effects caused by both the Gaussian function and the exponential modulation. Without knowledge of the specific modulation applied, multiple functions \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and constants \\\\( c \\\\) could correspond to the same \\\\( G(f) \\\\), preventing unique determination of the underlying components.",
