  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency. We evaluate how the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant, affects the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is another constant) is applied, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 solely depend on the original equation's frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be affected by the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) as well as by the scaling factors introduced by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\). Each exponential transformation modifies the magnitude of the complex number, potentially in a compounded manner, thus impacting the resultant state at time T.",
