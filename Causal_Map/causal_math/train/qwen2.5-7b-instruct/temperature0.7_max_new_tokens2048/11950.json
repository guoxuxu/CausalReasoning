  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit modeled by a complex function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is the complex frequency, representing the circuit's impedance. An integral transformation, specifically the Laplace Transform, is used to analyze the circuit's behavior in response to various input signals represented as functions of \\\\( s \\\\).\n\nIf at a specific frequency \\\\( s_1 \\\\), a filtering operation characterized by \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is introduced as an intervention, will the final output \\\\( Y(T) \\\\) be independent of the original impedance \\\\( Z(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final output will still depend on the original impedance \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) along with the new filter characteristic \\\\( F(s) \\\\). The output becomes a function of both factors since the filter modifies the signal in addition to the inherent impedance, resulting in \\\\( Y(s) = Z(s) F(s) X(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
