  "Problem": "Consider the laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) of a differentiable function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), where \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). We examine the effects of introducing a derivative operation into the transform defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f'(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( f(t) \\\\) at a certain instance say \\\\( t_0 \\\\) with \\\\( h(t) \\\\), will the laplace transform of the derivative, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f'(t) + h(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), depend only on the original \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and not on the nature of \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The laplace transform of the modified derivative incorporates changes due to \\\\( h(t) \\\\), effectively altering what would have been the output solely from \\\\( F'(s) = sF(s) - f(0) \\\\) to something involving the Laplace transform of \\\\( h(t) \\\\), making it dependent on the nature of \\\\( h(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace transform of the derivative of a function plus another function depends on the Laplace transform of the original function and the Laplace transform of the additional function."
