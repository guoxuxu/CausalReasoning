  "Problem": "Consider a stochastic process governed by the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a differential operator. We are interested in the behavior under the transformation \\\\( G(u) = \\\\int e^{-tx} u(x) \\\\, dx \\\\), which integrates along the spatial variable x with a decay term dependent on time t.\n\nCan we fully reconstruct the original function \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) from the observed \\\\( u(T, x) \\\\) at time T after application of \\\\( G(u) \\\\) without prior knowledge of the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( G(u) \\\\) involves an integral transformation with a time-dependent decay factor, it results in loss of information about the initial spatial distribution. Without knowledge of how \\\\( G(u) \\\\) was applied, it is generally impossible to exactly recover \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) from \\\\( u(T, x) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of G(u) transforms the initial function u_0(x) into u(T, x) at time T, and this transformation allows us to observe u(T, x) which is influenced by the original function u_0(x)."
