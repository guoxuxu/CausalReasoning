  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), a basic wave equation where \\\\(c\\\\) is the velocity of wave propagation. We investigate how the application of the Laplace transform \\\\(L\\\\) affects the solution \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\), specifically when considering boundary conditions and time transformations.\n\nIf a Laplace transform \\\\(L\\\\) is applied to the differential equation at t = 0, and the system evolves under its natural laws without any further transformations, will the transformed solution \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(x,s)\\\\) via \\\\(L\\\\) provide a correct representation at t = T without reverting the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation of the PDE into the Laplace space modifies the form of the PDE, often simplifying or altering the dependency on time. Without the inverse transformation, the behavior at any specific time \\\\(t = T\\\\) cannot be directly observed in the Laplace space since it includes the entire function over time, not at a specific point.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Laplace transform L to the wave equation at t=0 yields the transformed solution \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(x,s)\\\\), which represents the solution u(x,t) for t=T without reverting the transformation."
