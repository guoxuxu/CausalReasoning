  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = z_0 e^{iwt} \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant, under various conditions where the function is transformed by \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) over time t.\n\nIf a new function \\\\( g(z) = z + 1 \\\\) is applied at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( w \\\\) and not on previous transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) = z + 1 \\\\) alters the trajectory by introducing an additive shift, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on the earlier transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) as well. The sequence of transformations affects the path taken by the system, modifying the endpoint output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z at time t (z(t)) causally influences the value of z at a later time t+Δt (z(t+Δt)), which in turn is transformed by f(z) to z^2. Applying g(z) at time t_1 changes z(t_1) to z(t_1)+1, but whether z(T) for T > t_1 depends only on w and not on previous transformations is contingent upon the specific conditions and sequence of interventions."
