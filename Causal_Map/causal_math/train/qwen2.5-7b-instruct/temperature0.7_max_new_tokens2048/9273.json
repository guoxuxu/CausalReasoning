  "Problem": "Imagine a system modeled by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is a complex function of time. We evaluate the impact of applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to z(0) at t = 0, then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, will z(T) at T = t be identical to if z(0) was evolved to T = t under the original equation?",
  "Explanation": "The implementation of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) transforms the initial condition by scaling it, which modifies the trajectory governed by the differential equation. The presence of \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) scales the amplitude, changing the solution to \\\\( z(t) = z(0)e^{(i\\\\omega + \\\\alpha)t} \\\\) instead of \\\\( z(t) = z(0)e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), which differs unless \\\\( \\\\alpha = 0 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of t directly causes changes in z through the evolution of z from z(0) under the differential equation, while the transformation f(z) introduces an additional scaling factor that depends on α but does not alter the fundamental relationship between t and z governed by the differential equation."
