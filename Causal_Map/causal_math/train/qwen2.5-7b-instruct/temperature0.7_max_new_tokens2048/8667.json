  "Problem": "In this scenario, we consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz \\\\), where the initial condition is \\\\( z(0) = z_0 \\\\). We explore transformations using the integral operator \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{s^2} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf at a particular time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function operation \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_0^{t_1} \\\\cos(s) z(s) ds \\\\) is applied, will the outcome at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced only by the original system dynamics and not by the initial transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The subsequent application of \\\\( G(z) \\\\) imposes another layer of transformation, altering the exact path and behaviour of the function beyond the initial transformation and system's natural dynamics. Thus, the final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be shaped by the original transformation, the system dynamics, and this subsequent intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z(t) at any time t is directly influenced by its initial condition z(0) through the differential equation. The function G(z) at time t_1 depends on z(s) from 0 to t_1. z(t) influences G(z) and ultimately z(T) for T > t_1, but G(z) does not directly influence z(T) beyond its own computation."
