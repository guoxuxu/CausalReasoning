  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), evolving over time t. Analyze the effect of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{at}z \\\\), where a is a complex constant, on the function.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 = e^{i0} = 1 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve according to \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at t = 0 changes the initial condition to \\\\( e^{a*0} \\\\times 1 = 1 \\\\), but as t progresses, the factor \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) will modify the trajectory from the standard \\\\( e^{it} \\\\). Therefore, the new trajectory is determined by \\\\( e^{(a+i)t} \\\\), which deviates from the original \\\\( e^{it} \\\\) unless a is purely imaginary and equals zero.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Time t directly causes z(t) and g(z). The constant a directly causes g(z). The initial value z_0 at t=0 directly causes z(t) at any later time T. Therefore, applying g(z) to z_0 at t=0 and then allowing it to evolve under z(t) is equivalent to directly evolving z_0 under z(t) from t=0 to T."
