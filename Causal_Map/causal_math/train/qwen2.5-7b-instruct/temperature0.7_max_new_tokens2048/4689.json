  "Problem": "Consider a heat transfer system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t = a^2u_{xx}\\\\) (typical heat equation) in a rod, where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant diffusivity property of the rod. We analyze the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(F(u(x,t)) = \\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, t)\\\\) and then solving the equation in the transform domain.\n\nIf we apply the Fourier transform to the initial condition \\\\(u_0(x) = u(x, 0)\\\\) and solve the transformed equation without further intervention, will the inverse Fourier transform of \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, t)\\\\) at t = T match the solution obtained by directly solving the PDE for \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Solving the heat equation via its Fourier transform and then applying the inverse transform computes the same solution as solving the original PDE directly due to the linearity and transformational properties of the Fourier transform. The transforms do not alter the fundamental properties of the solution.",
