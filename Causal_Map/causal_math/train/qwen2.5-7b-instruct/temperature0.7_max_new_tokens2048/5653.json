  "Problem": "Analyze the input-output relationship in a linear time-invariant (LTI) system characterized by the system function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s^2 + as + b} \\\\), where a and b are constants. Evaluate the impact of applying a Laplace transform, which translates the impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) into the frequency domain operation.\n\nIf the input \\\\( x(t) \\\\) to the system is a unit step function, and the system is left to process this input without additional modification, will the Laplace transform of the output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) be the product of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and the transform of \\\\( x(t) \\\\), i.e., \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Yes, in LTI systems, the output in the frequency domain is the product of the input's transform and the system function. Given that the Laplace transform of a unit step function is \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s} \\\\), the output transform \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) is indeed \\\\( H(s) \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{s} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "When the input x(t) is a unit step function, its Laplace transform X(s) is 1/s; multiplying X(s) by the system function H(s) results in the Laplace transform Y(s) of the output."
