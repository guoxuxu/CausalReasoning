  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(u(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-zt} f(t) dt\\\\) where z is a complex variable and f(t) represents a real-valued function of t. This integral transform is fundamental in solving differential equations and analyzing signal systems.\n\nIf the function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) is modified to \\\\(f(t) + h(t)\\\\) at t = 0, where \\\\(h(t)\\\\) is another function, and the integral transformation is applied to the new function without further intervention, will the resulting function \\\\(u(z)\\\\) be the same as if only \\\\(f(t)\\\\) was transformed?",
  "Explanation": "The modification of \\\\(f(t)\\\\) by adding \\\\(h(t)\\\\) changes the integrand in the defined transformation, leading to a different result for \\\\(u(z)\\\\). Since the transform is a linear operator, \\\\(u(z)\\\\) for \\\\(f(t) + h(t)\\\\) will be \\\\(u(z) + v(z)\\\\), where \\\\(v(z)\\\\) is the transformation of \\\\(h(t)\\\\).",
