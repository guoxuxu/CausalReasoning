  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) described by the complex differential equation \\\\( z'(t) = iz(t) \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The impact of an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is considered.\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( z(0) = 1 \\\\) is evolved according to the differential equation without further intervention by the transformation T, will \\\\( T[z](s) \\\\) be equivalent to the transformation applied initially at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the differential equation is linear and the transformation T is a linear operator, applying the transformation at any point during the evolution under the differential equation will yield the same result as applying it initially, due to the time-invariance property.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
