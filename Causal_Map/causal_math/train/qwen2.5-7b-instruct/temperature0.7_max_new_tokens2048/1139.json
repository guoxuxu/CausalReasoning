  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = e^{ix} \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We study the Fourier transform of this function determined by \\\\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z\\}(k) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{ix} e^{-ikx} dx \\).\n\nIf an additional transformation, say multiplication by \\\\( e^{-ix} \\\\\\), is applied before taking the Fourier transform, will the transform still show a delta function at \\\\( k = 1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of multiplying by \\\\( e^{-ix} \\\\) before the Fourier transform effectively neutralizes the exponential term, resulting in the integrand becoming unity across all x. The Fourier transform of a constant function (like 1) distributes across all frequencies, thus not producing a delta function at \\\\( k = 1 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Multiplying z(x) by e^(-ix) transforms it to z(x) * e^(-ix), which then has a Fourier transform F{z*exp(-ix)}(k) that shows a delta function at k = 0 due to the shift property of Fourier transforms."
