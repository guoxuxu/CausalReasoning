  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where A is a real constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex value. The function is modified by an integral transformation \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{iBt}z(t) dt \\\\), with B as another real constant.\n\nIf another transformation \\\\( H(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{iCt}z(t) dt \\\\) (where C is a real constant) is applied as an intervention at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend solely on A or also on B and C?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( H(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) adds complexity as it incorporates another integral transformation influenced by C. Therefore, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on all three parameters: A, B, and C, due to overlapping effects of these transformations on the state of the system throughout the interval.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
