  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the equation \\\\( z = Ce^{At}x \\\\), where A and C are constant matrices and x is the initial state vector. We explore how the Laplace Transform and its inverse affect the system's behavior over time.\n\nIf the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), and then the inverse Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\) is applied without any modifications, will the resulting function at any time t be the same as the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the Laplace Transform followed by its inverse without any modifications will perfectly reconstruct the original function, assuming no information is lost during the transformation and the functions are of a class for which the Laplace Transform is defined and invertible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Laplace Transform to z(t) converts it to Z(s), and applying the inverse Laplace Transform to Z(s) returns z(t) unchanged."
