  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit described by Laplace Transform to analyze its response. The initial condition is given by \\\\( V(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+1} \\\\), where V(s) represents the voltage in the Laplacian domain. A transformation defined by the operator \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+2} \\\\) is applied, representing a change in system response due to an added component.\n\nIf \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is applied to the initial voltage \\\\( V(s) \\\\) and then allowed to evolve naturally without further intervention, will the resultant voltage function at T be the same as if \\\\( V(s) \\\\) was directly used through time T without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) modifies the initial condition of the system. As a result, the circuit’s Laplacian domain representation changes, and so does its time-domain behavior. Because of the transformation, the output voltage will differ from the untransformed state across time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial voltage V(s) transforms to v(t) through the inverse Laplace transform. Applying H(s) to V(s) results in h(t). Without further intervention, the voltage function at time T after applying H(s) is different from the voltage function at time T using V(s) directly."
