  "Problem": "Consider a scenario involving a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined as \\\\( z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{As}x(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent vector function and A is a constant matrix. The transformation used is \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), with B also being a constant matrix.\n\nCan we reliably trace back to determine the exact form of \\\\( x(0) \\\\) from the observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) was applied, it's impossible to correctly backtrack to the original \\\\( x(0) \\\\) as the transformation could distort the effective initial conditions of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), influenced by both matrices A and B.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
