  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\) where 'a' is a constant complex number. We explore the scenario under the Fourier transform, defined by the integral transformation \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform result \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\), is it possible to uniquely reconstruct \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without ambiguity regarding whether it was originally \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) or another transformation applied prior to taking the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transformation of exponential functions like \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) resulting in forms like \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{a + i\\\\omega} \\\\) is unique. This form distinctively points back to \\\\( e^{at} \\\\), given that such a transformation is invertible and the inverse transformation is unique under the conditions that the function and its transform meet certain criteria (like not being zero almost everywhere).",
