  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) in a region \\\\(R\\\\). We study the behavior under a Fourier transform \\\\(F(u)\\\\) and analyze the system's response over a boundary \\\\(S\\\\) conditional on a function \\\\(v = e^{kt} u\\\\).\n\nIf an intervention by applying a transformation \\\\( v = e^{kt} u \\\\) at a specific boundary point and time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), is the final state of \\\\( u \\\\) at time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) only dependent on the initial condition set by \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) and not the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( v = e^{kt} u \\\\) changes the boundary condition, introducing a new factor that influences the evolution of \\\\( u \\\\). The final state at \\\\( T \\\\) will depend on both the initial Laplace condition and the exponential intervention due to the change in boundary values.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation v = e^(kt)u at a boundary point and time t_1 influences the value of u at later times T > t_1. The initial condition given by ∇²u = 0 in region R and the boundary condition S → v determine the evolution of u, including the effect of the intervention."
