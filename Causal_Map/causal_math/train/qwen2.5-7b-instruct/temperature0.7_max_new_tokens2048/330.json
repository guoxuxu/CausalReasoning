  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where the evolution of a function is described as \\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\), where \\( A \\) is a complex constant and \\( z_0 \\) a complex initial value. Analyze the impact of an integral transformation defined by the operator \\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{Bs}z(s) \\, ds \\), with \\( B \\) also a complex constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex value \\( z_0 \\) directly after observing \\( z(T) \\) if \\( T(z) \\) was applied, without knowing the application of \\( T(z) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "If \\( T(z) \\) was applied and not accounted for, the observed \\( z(T) \\) incorporates effects from the integration under \\( e^{Bs} \\). Without knowing both \\( B \\) and the exact formulation of \\( T(z) \\), \\( z_0 \\) cannot be uniquely or correctly inferred due to the modification in trajectory and accumulated values.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial complex value z_0 directly influences the function z(t) through the exponential growth factor e^(At). The operator B defines the integral transformation T(z) which transforms z(t) into T(z). Applying T(z) to z(t) results in T(z)."
