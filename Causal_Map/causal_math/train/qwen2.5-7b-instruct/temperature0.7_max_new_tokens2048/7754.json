  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant matrix. Suppose an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Nt'} z(t') dt' \\\\) is applied, where N is another constant matrix.\n\nAfter observing the system at time t, can we determine the initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) assuming no prior knowledge of the application of \\\\( T(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Lacking knowledge of the integral transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) application obscures the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) because the operation integrates past states affected by N. Without discerning the effect of N, retracing to the unaltered \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is mathematically obscure.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The matrix M directly influences z over time, N directly influences T(z) through the integral transformation, and T(z) is derived from z through the given transformation."
