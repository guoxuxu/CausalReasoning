  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator L acting on a space of functions, with the Fourier transform being used to transform these functions. An operator \\\\(M\\\\) modifies the function using transformation \\\\(Mf(x) = f(x-c)\\\\), where \\\\(c\\\\) is a constant. We examine how the spectrum of the functions is affected over the transformation by \\\\(M\\\\).\n\nIf a different operator \\\\(Nf(x) = f(-x+c)\\\\) is applied as an intervention after applying \\\\(M\\\\), will the resultant spectrum still only reflect the initial shift by \\\\(c\\\\) in \\\\(Mf(x) = f(x-c)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional intervention with \\\\(N\\\\), which effectively reflects and then shifts, changes the spectrum again. The Fourier transform of \\\\(Nf(x) = f(-x+c)\\\\) introduces additional modifications to the spectrum, hence the resultant spectral characteristics can't be ascribed solely to the shift by \\\\(c\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying operator M shifts the spectrum by c, then applying operator N further transforms the function by reflecting it about -c and shifting it by c, resulting in a final spectrum that reflects both transformations."
