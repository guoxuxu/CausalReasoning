  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit with an inductor L and resistor R in series connected to an alternating voltage source given by \\\\( V(t) = V_0 e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\). The voltage across the inductor is described by the equation \\\\( V_L = L\\\\frac{dI}{dt} \\\\) and the resistor by \\\\( V_R = RI \\\\). We study the effect of altering the frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) of the source on the current \\\\(I(t)\\\\) in the circuit.\n\nFrom observing a decrease in the current amplitude \\\\(I(t)\\\\), can we definitively infer that there was an increase in the frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) of the voltage source?",
  "Explanation": "While an increase in frequency can cause a reduction in current amplitude due to increased impedance, other factors such as changes in resistance, or even a reduction in the source voltage \\\\(V_0\\\\), might also lead to a similar effect. Therefore, decrease in current doesn't uniquely imply an increase in frequency.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
