  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a complex constant. We analyze the behavior of this system when subjected to a Fourier transform, defined as \\\\( \\mathcal{F}(z)(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-i \\xi t} z(t) \\, dt \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\) is Fourier transformed without any modifications, will the resulting function \\\\( \\mathcal{F}(z)(\\xi) \\\\) peak at \\\\( \\xi = \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( e^{i \\omega t} \\\\) yields a Dirac delta function centered at \\\\( \\omega \\\\), implying a peak at \\\\( \\xi = \\omega \\\\). This demonstrates that the original frequency \\(\\omega\\) dominantly characterizes the transformed function.",
