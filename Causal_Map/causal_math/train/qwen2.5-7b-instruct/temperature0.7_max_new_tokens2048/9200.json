  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by a differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a constant matrix. We explore the effect of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\), where \\\\( Q \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nHaving observed the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we conclusively determine what transformations were involved (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), solely by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the specific interventions based on the endpoint output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is fraught with uncertainty. The endpoint can result from various interaction combinations between \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Rt} \\\\), compounded by the base transformation under \\\\( P \\\\). This non-commutativity and overlay make pinpointing interventions solely by observing the endpoint impractical.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z(T) depends on the initial condition z(0), the matrix P, and the time T through the differential equation dz/dt = Pz. The transformation g(z) = e^(Qt)z introduces an additional factor involving the matrix Q and time T, but knowing only z(T) is insufficient to determine the specific transformations involved without additional information."
