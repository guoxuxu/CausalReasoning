  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where a signal \\( x(t) \\) undergoes a Fourier transform to produce \\( X(f) \\), which is then altered by a transfer function \\( H(f) \\) and subsequently inverse Fourier transformed to generate \\( y(t) \\).\n\nIf during the transformation process an additional filter \\( G(f) \\) is applied to \\( X(f) \\) after \\( H(f) \\) and before inverse transformation, will \\( y(t) \\) at the conclusion of this augmented process solely reflect the initial effect of \\( H(f) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional application of \\( G(f) \\) as an intervention fundamentally alters \\( Y(f) \\) (the product of \\( X(f) \\) with \\( H(f) \\) and \\( G(f) \\)), complicating the resulting \\( y(t) \\). The final output is influenced by both \\( H(f) \\) and \\( G(f) \\), not just \\( H(f) \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The signal x(t) is transformed to X(f), which is then modified by H(f) and G(f) to become X_final(f). Applying the inverse Fourier transform to X_final(f) results in y(t)."
