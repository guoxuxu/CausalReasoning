  "Problem": "Examine the calculation of the Laplace transform of the function \\\\( u(t) = t^2 \\\\) which is then convolved with another function \\\\( v(t) = e^{-t} \\\\). The Laplace transform is a powerful integral transformation used in solving differential equations and analyzing systems responses.\n\nDoes the Laplace transform of the convolution of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) equal the product of their individual Laplace transforms without any additional modifications?",
  "Explanation": "In the theory of Laplace transforms, the transform of the convolution of two functions is equal to the product of their individual transforms. Thus, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u * v\\\\} = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u\\\\} \\\\cdot \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{v\\\\} \\\\), without any need for modifications or adjustments.",
