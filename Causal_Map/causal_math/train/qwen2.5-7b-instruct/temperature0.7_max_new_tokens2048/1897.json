  "Problem": "Consider a nonlinear system modeled by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax^2 + Bx + C \\\\), where A, B, and C are constants. We explore the system's behavior with the initial condition \\\\( x(0) = x_0 \\\\) and a transformation defined by \\\\( f(x) = Dxe^{Et} \\\\), where D and E are constants.\n\nIf \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, resulting in a new initial condition, and then allowed to evolve under the given differential equation without further intervention, will the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time T deviate from the trajectory had no transformation been applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation modifies the initial condition to \\\\( Dx_0e^{E \\\\cdot 0} = Dx_0 \\\\), affecting the trajectory right from the onset. Since the differential equation is nonlinear, even a slight change in the initial condition leads to markedly different trajectories.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition x_0 directly influences x(t) over time; applying the transformation f(x) at t=0 results in a new initial condition x'(0), which then influences x(t') and subsequently x(T); if no transformation is applied, x(T) would follow a different trajectory."
