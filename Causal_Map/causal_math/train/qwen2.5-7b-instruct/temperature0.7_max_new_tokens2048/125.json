  "Problem": "Imagine an electrical circuit consisting of series RLC components (Resistor, Inductor, and Capacitor) where the transfer function H(s) in the Laplace domain represents the relation between the input voltage and the output current. The circuit dynamics are affected by the introduction of a complex impedance Z(s) = s/(s^2 + s + 1), which modifies H(s).\n\nIf the impedance Z(s) is incorporated into the circuit without any other interventions, and then allowed to operate under normal conditions, will the behavior of the output current over time be identical to the scenario where Z(s) was not integrated?",
  "Explanation": "Integrating Z(s) into the circuit changes the overall transfer function, which consequently alters the system's response to any input voltage over time compared to the original setup without Z(s). This results in a different output current profile.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
