  "Problem": "Consider a response system described by \\\\( u(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty h(t) x(z-t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is the system's impulse response, and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is an input signal. Analyze the impact of a Fourier transform applied to the system's output, where the Fourier transform \\\\( F \\\\) of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} g(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nAfter observing the transformed output \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega) \\\\) and knowing the impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\), can one retrieve the exact function of the input \\\\( x(t) \\\\) that was used?",
  "Explanation": "The exact retrieval of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega) \\\\) using only \\\\( \\\\hat{h}(\\\\omega) \\\\) is generally not guaranteed without further conditions such as non-zero values of \\\\( \\\\hat{h}(\\\\omega) \\\\) everywhere. There could be frequencies where \\\\( \\\\hat{h}(\\\\omega) \\\\) might be zero, leading to potential loss of information about \\\\( \\\\hat{x}(\\\\omega) \\\\) at those frequencies.",
