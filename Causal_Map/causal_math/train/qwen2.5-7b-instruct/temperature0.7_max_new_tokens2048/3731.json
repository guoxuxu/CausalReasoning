  "Problem": "Consider the transformation of the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, transformed by \\\\( f(z) = e^{iAt} z \\\\) over time t, where A is a real constant. This represents a rotation in the complex plane.\n\nIf an intervention in the form of another transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{-iBt}z \\\\) is applied at some time t = K, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be independent of the initial rotational transformation parameters A?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be affected by both transformations. The transformation due to A and the opposite direction rotation due to B interplay to define the final position of \\\\( z(T) \\\\), and hence the outcome depends on both parameters.",
