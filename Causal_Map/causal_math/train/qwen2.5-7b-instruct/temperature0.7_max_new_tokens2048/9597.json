  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\( f(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\). The function is subjected to the integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(f) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-s^2} f(s) ds \\\\). Analyze the implications of applying this transformation on the function's behavior.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied on a complex plane and then \\\\( g(f) \\\\) is implemented, will the output necessarily be the same regardless of the variations within the complex plane?",
  "Explanation": "The output of \\\\( g(f) \\\\) can change based on how the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\) behaves across different parts of the complex plane. The integral transformation \\\\( g(f) \\\\) is sensitive to changes in \\\\( f(z) \\\\) due to variations in \\\\( e^{z^2} \\\\) across the domain of integration.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of \\( f(z) \\) at a point \\( z \\) on the complex plane determines the contribution of that point to the integral defining \\( g(f) \\), and thus the value of \\( g(f) \\) depends on \\( f(z) \\) over the entire range of integration."
