  "Problem": "Analyze the stability and behavior of a fluid flow governed by the Navier-Stokes equation in the form \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\vec{u}}{\\\\partial t} + (\\\\vec{u} \\\\cdot \\\\nabla)\\\\vec{u} = -\\\\nabla p + \\\\nu \\\\nabla^2 \\\\vec{u}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\vec{u}\\\\) is the fluid velocity, \\\\(p\\\\) is the pressure, and \\\\(\\\\nu\\\\) is the viscosity. Consider the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\vec{u}(t))\\\\) applied to the velocity field.\n\nIf the initial velocity field \\\\(\\\\vec{u}_0\\\\) is transformed by Laplace transform and evolved according to the Navier-Stokes equation, will the velocity field \\\\(\\\\vec{u}(t)\\\\) at any time t be described accurately by the inverse Laplace transform of \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform linearizes the problem allowing the governing equations to be treated in the transformed domain. If correctly transformed and no other transformations are applied, the inverse Laplace transform of \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(s)\\\\) should recover the original velocity field \\\\(\\\\vec{u}(t)\\\\).",
