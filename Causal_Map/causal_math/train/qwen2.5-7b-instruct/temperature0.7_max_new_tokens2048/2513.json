  "Problem": "Given a linear system governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Mx \\), where \\( M \\) is a constant matrix, consider examining the impact of the linear transformation \\( T(x) = Qx \\) for a matrix \\( Q \\). We investigate how this affects the system across different time points.\n\nIf \\( T(x) \\) is applied to a vector \\( x_0 \\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\( \\dot{x} = Mx \\) without further intervention, will \\( x(t) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( x_0 \\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\( \\dot{x} = Mx \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\( T(x) \\) alters the initial condition to \\( Qx_0 \\). The solution to the differential equation starting from \\( Qx_0 \\) at t = 0 would evolve differently compared to starting from \\( x_0 \\), unless \\( Q \\) commutes with \\( e^{Mt} \\), which is generally not the case.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the linear transformation T(x) to x_0 at t=0 and allowing it to evolve under \\(\\dot{x} = Mx\\) will result in a different x(t) compared to directly evolving x_0 to t=T under \\(\\dot{x} = Mx\\), unless T corresponds to a similarity transformation that preserves the solution structure."
