  "Problem": "Analyzing the system described by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a differential operator. We evaluate the impact of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi)\\\\) applied to the function u(x, t), and how it evolves over time.\n\nIf \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi)\\\\) is computed for a function \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) at t = 0 and then the function is evolved under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) without further transformation, will the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi, t)\\\\) at time t = T be the same as if \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) and then transformed?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the solution to \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) evolves in a predictable manner determined by the operator L when represented in the Fourier space. The evolution in real space and subsequent transformation to Fourier space should be equivalent to evolving the Fourier transform of the initial condition directly under the transformed operator.",
