  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant. This function models a simple harmonic oscillator in the complex plane over time t. We investigate the effect of applying a Fourier transform to this function and then examining the implications of manipulations in the frequency domain.\n\nCan we determine precisely which frequencies were present before a selective filtering intervention was applied, based solely on the output from an inverse Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "After interventions that modify the frequency spectrum (such as selective filtering), the resulting time-domain function loses information about any frequencies that were removed. It's thus impossible to uniquely determine the original frequency components that were present before the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The original function z(t) transforms into its frequency domain representation through the Fourier transform, and this transformation can be reversed using the inverse Fourier transform to recover the original function."
