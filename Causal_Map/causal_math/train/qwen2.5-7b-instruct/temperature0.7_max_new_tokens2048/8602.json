  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function system governed by \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The impact of a holomorphic transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) is considered over time.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T = t without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), we cannot ascertain if the trajectory observed stemmed from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or \\\\( z_0^2 \\\\). The complex squaring might have changed the initial phase and magnitude, complicating backward deduction.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial complex value z(0) directly influences z(T). The constant C and angular frequency ω together determine z(t) over time."
