  "Problem": "Consider the heat equation \\\\(u_t = u_{xx}\\\\), governing the temperature distribution u(x,t) in a rod along x axis. We consider the impact of an initial temperature distribution manipulated by the function \\\\(g(u) = Au + h\\\\), where A is a constant and h is a constant function.\n\nFollowing the observation of \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) after evolving from the modified initial condition at t = 0, can we deduce the original temperature distribution \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether \\\\( g(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the initial distribution was modified by \\\\( g(u) = Au + h \\\\), we cannot retrieve the original temperature distribution \\\\( u_0 \\\\). The alteration from the linear transformation and addition of h masks the original state and its subsequent natural evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
