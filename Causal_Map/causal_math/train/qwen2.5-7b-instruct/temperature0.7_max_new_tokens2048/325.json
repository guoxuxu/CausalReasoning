  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu + p(x,t)\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator and p(x,t) is a source function. We will investigate the influence of a Fourier transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(k,t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx} f(x,t) dx \\\\), applied to the source function p(x,t).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{p}(k,t) \\\\) is applied to the source function p(x,0) at t = 0, and then the solution u(x,t) is evolved under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu + p(x,t)\\\\) without further intervention, will u(x,T) be the same as if the system was evolved with the original p(x,t)?",
  "Explanation": "Transforming p(x,t) affects its distribution and interaction with the differential operator L. The solution u(x,t) will evolve differently due to modifications in the source term's spectral content, affecting the overall system dynamics and resulting in a different u(x,T).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition p(x,0) influences the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{p}(k,0)\\\\), which in turn affects p(x,t) over time. This modified p(x,t) then influences the evolution of u(x,t) according to the given partial differential equation."
