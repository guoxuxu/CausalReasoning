  "Problem": "Consider a complex system where the temperature distribution in a rod is given by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\), representing the heat equation with diffusion coefficient k. To study the influence of surface coatings, a transformation represented by \\\\(u(x,0) = e^{-ax^2}\\\\) is applied at the initial time, where a is a constant.\n\nGiven the temperature profile \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether the initial transformation, the cooling effect, or both), only by observing \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The end temperature profile \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) can result from various combinations of initial conditions and interventions. The diffusive nature of the heat equation, combined with possible effects like cooling, can lead to similar temperature profiles from different initial conditions and different interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
