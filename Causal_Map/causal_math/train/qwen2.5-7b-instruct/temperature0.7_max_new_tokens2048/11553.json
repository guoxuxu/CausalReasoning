  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time representing the real and imaginary parts of the complex signal, respectively. Analyze the effects of a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\\\( M = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\\\\\ 2 & 3 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\) on the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t)) \\\\) of the signal.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( M \\\\) is applied to the signal vector \\\\( z_0 = [u(0), v(0)]^T \\\\) at t = 0, and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves without further interference, will the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t)) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly transformed under the usual process?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( M \\\\) changes the initial components of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), leading to a different complex function evolution. This alteration impacts the frequency components of the transform, resulting in a different Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t)) \\\\) at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the matrix M to the initial signal vector z_0 at t=0 transforms z_0, which then evolves over time to z(t). The Fourier transform F(z(t)) at time t=T reflects this evolution. Without further interference, F(z(t)) at t=T would not be the same as directly transforming z_0 with M due to the time-dependent nature of z(t)."
