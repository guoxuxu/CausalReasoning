  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the function \\( z = f(x, y) \\) where \\( f(x, y) = x^2 + iy^2 \\), and \\( x, y \\) are real variables. Here, we further explore the effect of the integral transformation defined by \\( T[f](\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x, y) e^{-i\\omega x} dx \\) on this system.\n\nAfter applying the above intervention and observing \\( T[g](\\omega) \\), can we precisely infer whether the original function was \\( f \\) or another function with similar properties in \\( T[\\cdot](\\omega) \\) computations?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation process through \\( T[\\cdot](\\omega) \\) and the nature of the functions involved means that similar transformations from other initial functions may yield similar \\( T[g](\\omega) \\). The specific properties of \\( f \\) and \\( g \\) and their influence on the outcome in \\( T \\) do not necessarily allow for a unique causal deduction back to \\( f \\) or a distinct alternative, especially without additional information about the original phase and state variables \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
