  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency. We examine the impact of an integral transformation \\\\(T(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) \\\\, dt\\\\) applied to \\\\(z(t)\\\\) over a period \\\\(T\\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the exact function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at any time point \\\\(t\\\\) from the result of \\\\(T(z)\\\\), if it is known that the result is zero?",
  "Explanation": "The result of \\\\(T(z)\\\\) being zero is consistent with \\\\(z(t)\\\\) being a complex exponential with non-zero frequency over one period, but it does not uniquely identify \\\\(z(t)\\\\), as any phase shift or similar frequency exponential would yield the same transformation result.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
