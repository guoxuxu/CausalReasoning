  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving over time in a complex plane, influenced by a differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where P is a constant complex number. We investigate the effects of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int e^{Qt}z dt \\\\), where Q is another constant complex number.\n\nIf no modification is made and the complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves based solely on the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\) for some time T, will the transformed state after applying \\\\( T(z) \\\\) remain the same as the original state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without applying \\\\( T(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) modifies the trajectory of the complex function via integration. It accumulates all prior states transformed by \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\), which ultimately results in a different outcome compared to just evolving the state under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The differential equation Pz directly causes the evolution of z(t) over time; z(t) being transformed by T results in the integral of e^(Qt)z(t) over time; this integral transformation Qt → e^(Qt)z(t) → int(e^(Qt)z(t) dt) modifies z(t) to produce T(z)."
