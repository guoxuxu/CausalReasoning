  "Problem": "Analyze a complex system where the rate of growth of a population \\\\( p \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dp}{dt} = p^2 \\\\), representing unrestricted quadratic growth. We consider alterations to this model through a transformation function \\\\( h(p) = p e^{-kt} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant decay factor.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(p) \\\\) is applied to the initial population \\\\( p_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to grow according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dp}{dt} = p^2 \\\\) without further intervention, will the population \\\\( p(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( p_0 \\\\) had been directly evolved under \\\\( \\\\frac{dp}{dt} = p^2 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(p) \\\\) at t = 0 modifies the initial population to \\\\( p_0 e^{-kt} \\\\), which affects the growth trajectory significantly. The decay factor \\\\( k \\\\) causes an exponential decrease in the initial population, altering the quadratic growth process and leading to different population values at any subsequent time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
