  "Problem": "Examine a scenario involving a wave equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} = \\\\frac{1}{c^2}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2}\\\\), where c is the wave speed. Let the transformation \\\\(f(u) = u \\\\cdot e^{\\\\lambda t}\\\\) be applied, where \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the wave function at t=T, \\\\(u(T)\\\\), can we determine the original wave function \\\\(u_0\\\\) at t=0 without knowing whether \\\\(f(u)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about the application of \\\\(f(u)\\\\), it is not possible to accurately determine \\\\(u_0\\\\) because the exponential factor \\\\(e^{\\\\lambda t}\\\\) changes the amplitude in ways that are not distinguishable solely from the state at t=T, especially without knowledge of \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation f(u) to the wave function u results in u(T), and given u(T) at time T, we can trace back to find the original wave function u_0 at t=0 if f(u) was applied."
