  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) representing oscillatory behavior with angular frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\). We examine the scenario where we apply a Fourier transform \\\\(F\\\\) to \\\\(z(t)\\\\), thereby transforming the function into the frequency domain.\n\nIf the function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is Fourier transformed to obtain \\\\(F(z)\\\\), and then allowed to exist in the frequency domain without further intervention, will the inverse Fourier transform of \\\\(F(z)\\\\) at a later time \\\\(T\\\\) recover the original function, \\\\(z(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform and its inverse are well-defined linear operations, and no external transformation is applied to \\\\(F(z)\\\\) in the frequency domain. Hence, the inverse Fourier transform of \\\\(F(z)\\\\) will accurately recover \\\\(z(t)\\\\), assuming perfect conditions like infinite integration limits and no signal degradation.",
