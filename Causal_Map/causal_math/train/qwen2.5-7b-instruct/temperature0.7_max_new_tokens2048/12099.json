  "Problem": "Assume a problem in complex functions where the operation involves applying the Fourier transform on a function \\(\\phi(t)\\), which is described as \\(\\mathcal{F}(\\phi)(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\phi(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt\\). The transformed function is then acted on by a linear transformation \\(\\mathbf{L}\\), which alters frequencies in a specific predictable way.\n\nGiven the information of the Fourier-transformed output \\(\\mathcal{F}(\\phi(T))(\\omega)\\), is it possible to reconstruct the entire sequence of transformations and original function, assuming sporadic interventions have occurred?",
  "Explanation": "The effect of interventions, especially when linear transformations like \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) are involved, can significantly alter the state of \\(\\phi(t)\\) without leaving traceable characteristics post-Fourier transform. Without additional details regarding when and how these interventions were applied, it is generally not feasible to uniquely determine the sequence of events leading to the observed transformed state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The original function phi(t) is transformed into its Fourier representation F(phi)(ω) through the Fourier transform. This Fourier representation is then modified by the linear transformation L, resulting in L(F(phi))(ω). The application of a transformation T changes the argument of the Fourier transform to F(phi(T))(ω)."
