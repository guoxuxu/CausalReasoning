  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state. We explore the effects of a transformation given by \\\\( h(z) = e^{i \\theta}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\theta \\\\) is a constant phase shift.\n\nAssuming that at some time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), a different transformation \\\\( k(z) = e^{i \\phi}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\phi \\\\) is another constant) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend solely on \\\\( \\omega \\\\) without influence from \\\\( \\theta \\\\) or \\\\( \\phi \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( k(z) \\\\) introduces an additional phase shift, which, along with the initial modification by \\\\( h(z) \\\\), affects the trajectory and final state at T. Thus, the resulting state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is affected by both \\\\( \\theta \\\\) and \\\\( \\phi \\\\), not just the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
