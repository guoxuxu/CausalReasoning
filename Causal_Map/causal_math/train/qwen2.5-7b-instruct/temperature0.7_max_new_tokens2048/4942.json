  "Problem": "Investigate the response function R(z) in a complex system, where \\\\( R(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z^2 + az + b} \\\\), with complex coefficients a and b. The system's behavior is probed using a transformation \\\\( T(s) = e^{st} \\\\) where s is a complex number and t represents time.\n\nWithout prior knowledge of the parameter s in \\\\( T(s) \\\\), can one determine the exact value of s from observing the evolution of \\\\( R(z) \\\\) at z = e^{st} over time?",
  "Explanation": "Observing the evolution of \\\\( R(e^{st}) \\\\) without the intervention provides information about the time-dependent behavior, but it cannot uniquely determine s because different values of s could result in similar evolution trajectories due to the periodicity and exponential nature of the transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
