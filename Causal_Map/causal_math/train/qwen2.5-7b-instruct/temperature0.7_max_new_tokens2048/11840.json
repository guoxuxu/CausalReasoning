  "Problem": "We consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\) where L is a linear differential operator. We investigate the effects of applying Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(u(t)) \\\\) to the system, with its inverse transform typically denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\).\n\nDoes applying the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(u(t)) \\\\) at t = 0 impact the future state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) at T > 0 compared to leaving the system evolve governed only by \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform is a linear transformation that does not modify the original function or the system dynamics but rather represents it in a different domain. The system’s evolution by \\\\( Lu \\\\) remains unaffected in the time domain, regardless of whether the Laplace transform is applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(u(t)) \\\\) at t impacts the representation of u(t) in the s-domain, which influences the future state u(T) at T > 0 through the inverse transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\). The linear differential operator L governs the evolution of u(t) over time."
