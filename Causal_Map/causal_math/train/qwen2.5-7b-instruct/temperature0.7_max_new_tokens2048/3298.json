  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant complex matrix. The function is evaluated and then transformed using the Fourier transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\). The system's behavior over the complex plane is considered under this transformation.\n\nGiven the Fourier transformed output, can we precisely infer the original function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) in its entirety without knowing \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The exact matrix \\\\( A \\\\) influences the specific form and behavior of the exponential in the function. The Fourier transform's output alone, without explicit knowledge of \\\\( A \\\\), does not allow for the precise reconstruction of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) across the complex plane, as multiple matrices could potentially yield similar transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
