  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on the complex plane \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We study the effects of applying a Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) and then modifying the function using another transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\), which is a transfer function in the s-domain.\n\nGiven \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) in the s-domain, can we conclusively determine the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of the original complex exponential \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) can be deduced from the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\). The poles of the transform in the s-domain are directly related to \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\), thereby allowing precise calculation of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The time-domain function z(t) is transformed into Z(s) through the Laplace transform, but Z(s) does not directly convey the frequency ω of z(t); additional information or inverse transform is required to determine ω."
