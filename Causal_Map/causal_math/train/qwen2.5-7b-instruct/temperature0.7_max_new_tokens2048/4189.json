  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex plane as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant real number representing angular frequency. This function describes a rotation in the complex plane. We analyze the impact of a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\\\( M = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\alpha & -\\beta \\\\\\\\ \\beta & \\alpha \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\), where \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\beta \\\\) are constants, on the state vector representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation matrix \\\\( M \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(0) \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve over time without further intervention, will \\\\( Mt \\\\) for \\\\( t = T \\\\) solely determine the state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The matrix \\\\( M \\\\) alters the initial conditions but does not solely dictate the state at time T since \\\\( z(t) \\\\) continues to evolve due to \\\\( e^{i \\omega t} \\\\). \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is consequently influenced by both the matrix \\\\( M \\\\) and the exponential rotation \\\\( e^{i \\omega T} \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
