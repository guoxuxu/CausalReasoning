  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( z'(t) = iz(t) \\\\). This differential equation describes a rotation in the complex plane. The function transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\), where k is a real constant, is analyzed over time t.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine exactly what interventions were employed (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), merely by knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from different combinations of intervening transformations, making it impossible to discern from the endpoint alone whether \\\\( e^{kt} \\\\",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
