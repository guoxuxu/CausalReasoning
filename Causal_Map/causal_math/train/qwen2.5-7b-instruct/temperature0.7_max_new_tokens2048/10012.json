  "Problem": "Analyze a complex dynamical system represented by a differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\), where C is a constant matrix and z is a complex function. The evolution is studied under the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), where D is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can definitive conclusions be made about the specific transformations (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) used based solely on knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complex interactions between matrices C, D, and E, and their exponential forms, different combinations of transformations can yield identical or indistinguishable results at \\\\( z(T) \\\\). This multifactorial influence renders unique identification of interventions challenging.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The constant matrix C directly influences the rate of change of z, D directly transforms z through the function f, and the time T determines the end state z(T)."
