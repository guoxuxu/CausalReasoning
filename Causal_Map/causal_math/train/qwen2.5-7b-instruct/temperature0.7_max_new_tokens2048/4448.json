  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real and imaginary parts respectively, governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix. We investigate the scenario where the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\) is applied, with N also being a complex matrix.\n\nConsidering the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we specifically identify the interventions used (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( j(z) \\\\), or both) by only knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Because of the potential complexity in the interactions between N, Q, and M through their respective matrix exponentials, multiple scenarios can lead to the same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Without distinct information on the differential impacts of N and Q, identifying specific interventions from the endpoint alone is infeasible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The real part u(t) and the imaginary part v(t) together determine z(t). The constant complex matrix M influences the rate of change of z(t) with respect to time. The complex matrix N affects the function h(z) which in turn influences z(T) at time T."
