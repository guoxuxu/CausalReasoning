  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear operator equation \\\\(Lx = \\lambda x\\\\). Analyze how utilizing a transformation \\\\(T(x) = e^{i\\theta}x\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\theta\\\\) a constant, affects the system over a time-scale \\\\(t\\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), a new function \\\\(S(x) = e^{i\\phi}x\\\\) (where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\phi\\\\) another constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\(x(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\(Lx = \\lambda x\\\\) and not on \\\\(\\theta\\\\) or \\\\(\\phi\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both interventions, \\\\(T\\\\) and \\\\(S\\\\), simply introduce a phase shift without altering the dynamics governed by L. Hence, the endpoint \\\\(x(T)\\\\) depends solely on the scaling factor \\\\(e^{\\lambda T}\\\\) determined by L, despite the phase shifts introduced by \\\\(\\theta\\\\) and \\\\(\\phi\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation T(x) = e^{iθ}x followed by S(x) = e^{iφ}x causes x(T) to be influenced by θ and φ, but the endpoint x(T) for T > t_1 depends on Lx = λx, θ, and φ."
