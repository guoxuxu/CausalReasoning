  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are real constants. A transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), with \\\\( C \\\\) being a complex constant, is considered.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) into \\\\( e^{Ct}z_0 \\\\), introducing a complex exponential growth factor \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) that distorts both the magnitude and phase of \\\\( z \\\\) over time. This leads to a divergent state trajectory considering the independent evolution paths defined by \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of x(t) and y(t) under the differential equations A → x(t+1) and B → y(t+1) determines z(t) → z(t+1). Applying the transformation f(z) = e^(Ct)z modifies z(t) → z(t+1) but only at t=0. Without further intervention, the direct evolution of z_0 under A and B from t=0 to t=T is equivalent to applying f(z) at t=0 and then evolving under A and B."
