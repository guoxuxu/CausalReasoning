  "Problem": "Analyze a feedback system involving the complex function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{1 - cz} \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a complex constant. This function is applied to the initial input \\\\( z_0 \\\\), and is continuously re-applied to its own output in a feedback loop. Additionally, explore how the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = Z(s) \\\\) influences the system over time.\n\nGiven the state of the system as \\\\( z(\\\\infty) \\\\), can we conclusively identify whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or just the feedback process involving \\\\( f(z) \\\\) were applied if both could lead to the same stable state under certain conditions?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the exact transformation(s) used to reach \\\\( z(\\\\infty) \\\\) is complex when similar stable states can be achieved through different paths due to the properties of the complex transformation functions. Without explicit details on the dynamics (time of intervention, nature of transformations) the causal path to \\\\( z(\\\\infty) \\\\) remains undeterminable.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "c → f(z); z_0 → z(1); z(n) → z(n+1); Z(s) → z(t); z(∞) → g(z); f(z) → z(∞)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The complex constant c directly influences the function f(z), which in turn determines the sequence z(n) that converges to z(∞). The Laplace transform Z(s) of z(t) represents the system's behavior over time, and if z(∞) is reached, it could be due to either the feedback process involving f(z) or the transformation g(z) under certain conditions."
