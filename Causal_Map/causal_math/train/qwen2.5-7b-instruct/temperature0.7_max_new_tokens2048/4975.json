  "Problem": "Analyze a mathematical system where the temperature distribution \\\\(T(x,t)\\\\) along a rod varies with time and position, governed by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\alpha \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. Consider an intervention represented by a heat source term \\\\(S(x,t)\\\\) introduced at a position \\\\(x1\\\\) affecting the system.\n\nIf the heat source \\\\(S(x,t)\\\\) is introduced at time \\\\(t1\\\\) affecting only a local region near \\\\(x1\\\\), will the final temperature distribution \\\\(T(x,T)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t1\\\\) be solely dependent on the properties and initial state of the system without considering the effects of \\\\(S\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by the localized heat source \\\\(S(x,t)\\\\) fundamentally alters the system dynamics at and around \\\\(x1\\\\) post \\\\(t1\\\\). This change will affect the entire system's temperature distribution over time due to the diffusion, making the end state dependent on both the system’s initial state and the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The introduction of the heat source S(x,t) at position x1 and time t1 directly influences the temperature distribution T(x,t) for times T > t1. The thermal diffusivity α and the initial temperature distribution T(x,t1) also causally affect T(x,t). Additionally, the temperature at position x1 at time t1 (T(x1,t1)) influences the temperature distribution T(x,t) for times T > t1."
