  "Problem": "Consider a complex function mapped to a vector field by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Cz} \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) represents complex numbers and \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant matrix. The action of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is studied on the plane transformed by the complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\), where \\\\( n \\\\) is an integer.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then \\\\( z \\\\) evolves under \\\\( g(z) \\\\) without further intervention, will the final state \\\\( g(z(T)) \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved under \\\\( g(z) \\\\) for a period \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\) changes the trajectory in the complex plane. Depending on the power \\\\( n \\\\), this warps the space differently, affecting how \\\\( g(z) = e^{Cz} \\\\) acts subsequently. For example, exponentiation and rotations induced by \\\\( z^n \\\\) can lead to different final states under \\\\( g(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation f(z_0) → z modifies the initial complex number z_0 to z, which then evolves under g(z) → g(z(T)). If z_0 is directly evolved under g(z) for a period T, it results in g(z_0(T)). Without further intervention, g(z(T)) will not necessarily be the same as g(z_0(T)), as the intermediate transformation by f(z) affects the initial state."
