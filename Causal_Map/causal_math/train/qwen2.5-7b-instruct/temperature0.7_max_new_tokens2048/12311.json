  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\) evolved under the differential system \\( \\dot{z} = z^2 + c \\) where \\( c \\) is a non-zero complex constant. Investigations include the effect of executing a transformation given by the integral transform \\( \\mathcal{F}(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt \\), with \\( s \\) being a complex parameter.\n\nGiven the function state \\( z(T) \\) with known interventions \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) and \\( \\mathcal{G} \\) at different times, is it feasible to precisely identify which transformation was applied first based solely on the final state \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\( z(T) \\) under complex transformations \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) and \\( \\mathcal{G} \\) does not retain straightforward information about the order of application due to the overlapping influence and interaction between the transformed terms and the inherent dynamic system. This results in a complexity that obscures the retrospective analysis of initial versus subsequent transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of the complex constant c influences the function z(t), which evolves over time to become z(T). The integral transform F(z) depends on the function z(t) and results in z(T). Different transformations F and G can lead to different z(T) values, potentially allowing identification of the order of transformations based on z(T)."
