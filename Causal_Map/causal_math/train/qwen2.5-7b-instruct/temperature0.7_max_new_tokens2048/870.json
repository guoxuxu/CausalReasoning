  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant control system governed by the equation \\\\(\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\) are constant matrices, and \\\\(u\\\\) is the control input. The system response to an input change is analyzed through the Laplace transform, leading to the transfer function \\\\(H(s) = C(sI - A)^{-1}B + D\\\\), with matrices \\\\(C\\\\) and \\\\(D\\\\) also being constants.\n\nGiven the output response in the Laplace domain, can we infer the exact nature of the input change (e.g., at what time and what kind of function) without additional data about the input history?",
  "Explanation": "While the transfer function \\\\(H(s)\\\\) does describe how different inputs affect the output, recovering the exact time or the form of the input only from the output response in the Laplace domain is ambiguous without extra information about input history, as multiple input configurations can lead to similar output responses.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
