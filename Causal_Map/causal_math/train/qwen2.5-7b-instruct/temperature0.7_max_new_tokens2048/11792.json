  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where x(t) and y(t) are real functions governed by differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cy + Du \\\\), with A, B, C, D being constants, and u a control input. We explore the effects of applying a Laplace transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), to the function z(t).\n\nIf the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z(t)) \\\\) is computed at t = 0, and then z(t) is allowed to evolve under the given system without further intervention, will the inverse transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}(\\\\mathcal{L}(z(t))) \\\\) at time t = T be the same as z(T) directly computed from the original differential equations?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform and its inverse should theoretically reconstruct the original function z(t) from its transform space back to time domain, assuming all conditions for convergence are met. Thus, z(T) should be the same as if it evolved directly under the original system.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "A direct application of the Laplace transform followed by its inverse does not change the function z(t) if there is no further external input u after the transform is applied. The evolution of x(t) and y(t) is governed by their respective differential equations with constants A, B, C, and D, and any initial input u affects x(t) and y(t) only up to t = 0."
