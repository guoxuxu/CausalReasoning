  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear operator. We evaluate the effect of the transformation given by the function \\\\( g(u) = v^{Dx}u \\\\) over spatial domain x, where \\\\(D\\\\) is a constant operator and \\\\(v\\\\) is a function of x.\n\nIf \\\\( g(u) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) at t = 0 and the system evolves under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(u) \\\\) modifies the initial state, thus changing the system's trajectory over time. The transformation \\\\( v^{Dx} \\\\) can significantly alter the dynamics of the system depending on the nature of \\\\(D\\\\) in relation to \\\\(L\\\\), leading to a different state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation g(u_0) = v^(Dx)u_0 to the initial condition u_0 at t=0 and then evolving it under the PDE ∂u/∂t = L(u) for time t=T results in the same u(x,t) at t=T as directly evolving u_0 under the same PDE from t=0 to t=T."
