  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where t represents time. We investigate the influence of a Fourier transformation on this function, represented as \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\) over the frequency domain \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is Fourier transformed without additional modification, will the primary frequency component in the Fourier domain be influenced by the initial phase of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The primary frequency component of the Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) will consistently revolve around the frequency point \\\\( \\\\omega = 1 \\\\) regardless of the initial phase, since the exponential function's nature ensures that it fundamentally manifests its frequency through its exponential term, unaffected by alteration in initial phase.",
