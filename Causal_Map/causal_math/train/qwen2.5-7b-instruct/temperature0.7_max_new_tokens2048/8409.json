  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\omega s} \\, ds \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. This system represents a basic integral transformation with a complex exponential kernel. We investigate the influence of a matrix multiplier \\\\( M \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( M \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) continues to evolve with the original integral transformation, will the result \\\\( Mz(T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolved from \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( T \\\\) without the application of \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the matrix \\\\( M \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time zero modifies the initial conditions, resulting in a trajectory alteration. The outcome at time \\\\( T \\\\), \\\\( Mz(T) \\\\), is not only scaled but could potentially have its vector orientation changed depending on the properties of \\\\( M \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The matrix M applied to z(0) causes Mz(T) at time T; z(t) evolving from t=0 to T causes z(T); applying M to z(0) before the evolution results in Mz(T) which is different from z(T) evolving without M."
