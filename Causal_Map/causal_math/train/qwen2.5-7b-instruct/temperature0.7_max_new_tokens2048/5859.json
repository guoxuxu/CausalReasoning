  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t}\\\\) applied as a transformation on a time-dependent signal \\\\(x(t)\\\\), producing a new signal \\\\(y(t) = z(t) x(t)\\\\). Where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant representing angular frequency. This scenario explores the relation and transformation effect with and without interventions such as changing the frequency or applying a damping factor.\n\nSuppose a damping factor \\\\(e^{-\\\\alpha t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a constant, is introduced as an intervention at time \\\\(t_1\\\\). Does the combined impact of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) and the damping factor from \\\\(t_1\\\\) to T make \\\\(y(T)\\\\) independent of the initial frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(e^{-\\\\alpha t}\\\\) adjusts the amplitude but not the frequency of the transformation. Even though the signal is now dampened, the effect of the original frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) embedded in \\\\(z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t}\\\\) on the phase of \\\\(y(t)\\\\) remains critical, influencing the final form of \\\\(y(T)\\\\).",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The angular frequency ω directly influences z(t), which in turn directly influences y(t). Introducing a damping factor e^{-αt} starting at t_1 changes y(t). The application of the damping factor can potentially make y(T) independent of ω, but this depends on the specific values of α and T."
