  "Problem": "Consider a series of random variables \\\\( X_1, X_2, ..., X_n \\\\), each formed by the linear transformation \\\\( Y_i = AX_i \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix. We examine the impact of the Fourier transform on these variables and explore the causal inference across these transformations.\n\nIf the Fourier transform is applied to the variables \\\\( X_1, X_2, ..., X_n \\\\) and then \\\\( Y_i \\\\) are computed, will the spectra of \\\\( Y_i \\\\) be equivalent to directly applying the Fourier transform after the linear transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of a linearly transformed variable (i.e., \\\\( Y_i = AX_i \\\\)) results in the multiplication of the transform of \\\\( X_i \\\\) by a matrix associated with \\\\( A \\\\) in the frequency domain. This operation commutes under these circumstances, demonstrating the equivalence of spectra either way.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
