  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a linear partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. Examine the influence of introducing an integral transformation \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int k(x, y)u(y)dy \\\\) where \\\\( k(x, y) \\\\) is the kernel of the transformation.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a different integral transformation \\\\( S(u) = \\\\int m(x, y)u(y)dy \\\\) (where \\\\( m(x, y) \\\\) is another kernel) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( u(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on L and not on k(x, y) or m(x, y)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( S(u) \\\\) introduces an additional modification of the system's state, making the final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) dependent not solely on L but also significantly influenced by both kernels k and m. The collective effects of these transformations shape the ultimate behavior of u at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "T(u) → u(T); S(u) → u(S); L → u(t)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The endpoint u(T) depends on the initial condition u(t_1) and the operator T(u) through the kernel k(x, y), while the operator L governs the evolution of u from t_1 to T. The intervention S(u) with kernel m(x, y) does not directly influence u(T) if it is applied after T(u) has been determined."
