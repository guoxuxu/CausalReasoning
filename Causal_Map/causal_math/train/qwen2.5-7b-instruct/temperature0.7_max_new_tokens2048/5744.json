  "Problem": "Consider a linear space of functions where the kernel operator K is defined on a function y(x). The relationship between y and its image under K is described through a convolution, i.e., \\\\( K*y = \\\\int h(t) y(x-t) dt \\\\), where h(t) is an impulse response function. We are interested in how the application of Fourier Transform (\\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\)) might influence this relationship.\n\nCan we determine whether an intervention (changing h(t) to g(t)) occurred, by only observing the Fourier Transform of the convolution result at a later stage?",
  "Explanation": "The final Fourier Transform of the convolution output could be influenced by many factors, including changes in the function y or the impulse response function. Without knowing the initial or intermediate states exactly, it is infeasible to pinpoint the specific intervention solely from the result.",
