  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where a set of points \\\\( z \\\\) in the complex plane undergoes a transformation defined by the function \\\\( w(z) = e^{iz} \\\\). Post-transformation, these points are subjected to an integral transformation, \\\\( T(w) = \\\\int_{0}^{2\\\\pi} e^{iw} dw \\\\).\n\nAfter applying \\\\( T(w) \\\\) to the transformed points, is it possible to reliably infer the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) merely from the resulting value of the integral transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation \\\\( w(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) fundamentally changes the form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), reconstructing the original function from the integral's result is nontrivial without additional information. The impact of the complex exponential transformation complicates the inverse operation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The original set of points z in the complex plane is transformed into w via the function w(z) = e^(iz), and then T is applied to w resulting in the integral transformation T(w) = ∫ from 0 to 2π of e^(iw) dw."
