  "Problem": "Consider a smooth manifold M in \\\\(\\\\mathbb{R}^n\\\\) equipped with a vector field \\\\(X(p)\\\\). Analyze the implications of applying an integral transformation \\\\(T(p) = \\\\int f(p) dp\\\\) on the manifold, where \\\\(f(p)\\\\) is a smooth function.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(T(p)\\\\) is applied on a point \\\\(p_0\\\\) in M and there is no further modification to the vector field or the manifold, will the flow lines of the vector field \\\\(X(p)\\\\) originating at \\\\(T(p_0)\\\\) be the same as those originating at \\\\(p_0\\\\) without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation modifies the initial point from \\\\(p_0\\\\) to \\\\(T(p_0)\\\\), thereby potentially changing the tangent vector at the point due to the new neighborhood conditions established by \\\\(f(p)\\\\). Hence, flow lines originating from \\\\(T(p_0)\\\\) may follow a different trajectory than those from \\\\(p_0\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of the smooth function f(p) determines the transformation T(p), which in turn influences the position p' of the point. The vector field X(p) dictates the flow lines, so the flow lines originating at T(p') will be different from those originating at p_0 unless T(p) does not change the position p'."
