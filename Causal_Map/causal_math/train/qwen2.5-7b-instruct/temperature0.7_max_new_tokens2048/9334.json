  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the state vector \\\\( x \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx + Cu\\\\), where D is a constant matrix and u is a control input. The impact of an integral transformation given by \\\\( h(x) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Ft}x(t) dt \\\\), where F is a constant matrix, is analyzed.\n\nGiven the value of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) over the time interval [0, T], can the original state vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) be uniquely determined without knowledge of the control input \\\\( u \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) integrates state behavior which is dependent on \\\\( u \\\\). Various control inputs can potentially yield the same integrated outcome, thus making it impossible to reverse-engineer \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without specific knowledge of \\\\( u \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The integral transformation h(x) is influenced by the state vector x, the matrix D, and the control input u. Specifically, h(x) depends on x through the integral of e^(Ft)x(t) over [0, T], and this dependence includes the effects of D and u."
