  "Problem": "Assume a system of linear equations modeled by the matrix equation \\\\( Ax = b \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and b is a constant vector. We investigate the effects of an integral transformation defined by the function \\\\( T(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At}x dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), and knowing that interventions were applied, can we precisely determine which transformations (either \\\\( T(x) \\\\), \\\\( S(x) \\\\), or both) were used by just looking at \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping effects of the transformations \\\\( T(x) \\\\) and \\\\( S(x) \\\\), and their non-exclusive influence on the system's dynamics under \\\\( Ax = b \\\\), make it difficult to uniquely identify which transformations were applied. The final state can result from various combinations and interactions of these transformations, creating ambiguity.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
