  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{At} x_0 \\\\), where A is a matrix with complex eigenvalues. This function represents the solution to a system of linear differential equations. We explore the effect using a Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(z(t); s) \\\\) as an analytic continuation in the complex plane.\n\nGiven \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) for all s, can we uniquely determine the initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and the matrix A, assuming no prior knowledge of whether any transformations were applied before taking the Laplace transform?",
  "Explanation": "In the absence of any transformation prior to taking the Laplace transform, the inverse Laplace Transform can be used to uniquely recover \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), from which the initial conditions and the dynamics governed by A can be determined assuming A has distinct eigenvalues.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
