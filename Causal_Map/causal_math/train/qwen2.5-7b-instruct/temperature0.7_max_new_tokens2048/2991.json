  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t} \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are real numbers. We are examining the effects of applying a Laplace transformation \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{z(t)\\} \\) which maps \\( z(t) \\) into the s-domain.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\( z(t) \\) to \\( z'(t) = z(t)e^{ct} \\) at some \\( t_1 \\geq 0 \\), where \\( c \\) is a real number, is the Laplace transform of this new function given by \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{z'(t)\\} \\) still a simple rational function of \\( s \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies \\( z(t) \\) to \\( z'(t) = e^{(a+c + bi)t} \\), and its Laplace transform is \\( \\frac{1}{s-(a+c+bi)} \\). This remains a simple rational function in \\( s \\), but with a shifted pole.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z(t) depends on a and b; modifying z(t) to z'(t) through multiplication by e^(ct) changes its Laplace transform to L{z'(t)}, which may not remain a simple rational function of s."
