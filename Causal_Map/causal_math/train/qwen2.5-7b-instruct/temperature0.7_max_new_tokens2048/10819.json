  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}z_0 \\\\) where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real frequency. Assess the influence of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{-i \\omega \\tau} z(\\tau) d\\tau \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies the system by applying a different frequency \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) at time t = t_1, will the transformation \\\\( T(z(t)) \\\\) from t = t_1 to t = T still only reflect the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The change in frequency alters the system's behavior fundamentally, affecting the output of the integral transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) from t = t_1 to T, reflecting the new frequency \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) along with the initial frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "ω → z(t); ω' → z(t); t_1 → ω'; t_1 → T(z(t)); ω → T(z(t))",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The frequency ω directly influences z(t) and indirectly T(z(t)). An intervention changing ω to ω' at t = t_1 will affect z(t) from t_1 onwards, but T(z(t)) from t_1 to T will still primarily reflect the influence of the original frequency ω before t_1."
