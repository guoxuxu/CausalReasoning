  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where the analysis focused on the effect of a complex integration transformation \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{a}^{z} f(w) dw \\\\) on a function \\\\( f(w) \\\\), which is analytic in a domain D. Assume \\\\( a \\\\) is a fixed point within D.\n\nCan the original function \\\\( f(w) \\\\) be uniquely determined by knowing the function \\\\( F(z) \\\\) across domain D, without any additional information or transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( f(w) \\\\) can be uniquely recovered from \\\\( F(z) \\\\) by taking the derivative, \\\\( f(w) = F'(w) \\\\). Since \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is a definite integral of \\\\( f \\\\), its derivative will reveal \\\\( f \\\\). This relationship is direct due to the fundamental theorem of calculus for complex functions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Knowing the function F(z) across domain D allows us to determine f(w) up to a constant, since F(z) is the antiderivative of f(w). Conversely, f(w) influences F(z) through integration."
