  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}x(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) satisfies the differential equation \\\\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\\\) with D being a constant matrix. The transformation applied is \\\\( f(x) = Ux \\\\) at time t = 0, where U is a unitary matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( f(x) \\\\) changes the initial conditions by applying the transformation U. Since U is unitary, it preserves the norm but may alter the direction, leading the system to evolve along a different trajectory, governed by the matrix D but starting from a different initial condition.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
