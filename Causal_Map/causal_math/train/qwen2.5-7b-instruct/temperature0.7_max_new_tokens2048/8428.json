  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\) where \\( \\omega \\) is the frequency of oscillation in radians per second. This defines a system where \\( z(t) \\) traces a circular path in the complex plane. Investigate the impact of a linear transformation \\( L(z) = Az + b \\) with complex constants A and b.\n\nGiven the final path of \\( z(T) \\), can we determine precisely which transformations were used (whether \\( L(z) \\), \\( M(z) \\), or both), only by observing the final state \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The end state \\( z(T) \\) might result from various potential transformations due to the non-linear interaction between the complex linear transformations and the oscillatory nature of \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\). Multiple combinations of \\( A \\), \\( b \\), \\( C \\), and \\( d \\) could yield the same final state at \\( T \\), hence making it challenging to uniquely determine the interventions used.",
