  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving over time according to a linear transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix. We analyze the effect of an applied linear transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) at time \\\\( t \\\\), with \\\\( B \\\\) being another complex matrix.\n\nGiven the final observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to distinctly determine which interventions (\\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were applied based purely on the observed endpoint?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing only \\\\( z(T) \\\\) does not clearly reveal which transformations were applied due to the potential overlap in effects created by non-commutative properties of the applied transformations. The ambiguity and similarity in possible states resulting from different combinations of transformations mean the interventions cannot be identified uniquely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
