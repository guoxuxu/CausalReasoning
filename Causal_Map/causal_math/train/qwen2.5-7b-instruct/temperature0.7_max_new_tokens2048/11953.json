  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( g(z) \\) defined on the complex plane as \\( g(z) = e^{cz} \\) where \\( c \\) is a constant complex number. The function is studied under the Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{g(t)\\}(s) \\) which transforms \\( g(t) \\) from the time domain to the complex \\( s \\)-domain.\n\nCan the original parameter \\( c \\) be correctly deduced by observing the transformed function \\( G(s) \\) without any additional information about the function form or prior intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\( G(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-c} \\), the pole of the function in the \\( s \\)-domain clearly indicates the value of \\( c \\). This allows back-solving for \\( c \\) uniquely from \\( G(s) \\) without ambiguity, ensuring accurate deduction of the cause (parameter \\( c \\)) from the effect (transformed function).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The parameter c influences the transformed function G(s) through the original function g(t), and observing G(s) allows deduction of c."
