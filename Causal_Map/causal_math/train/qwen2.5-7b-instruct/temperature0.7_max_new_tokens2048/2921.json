  "Problem": "Assume we are analyzing a thermal system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = \\\\Delta u + c u\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) represents the temperature distribution in a medium, \\\\(\\\\Delta\\\\) is the Laplacian operator, and \\\\(c\\\\) is a heat source term. Investigate the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), which changes the spatial domain into the frequency domain.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) is applied to the initial temperature distribution \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) at t = 0, then the equation is evolved without further intervention, will the temperature profile \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi, T)\\\\) at t = T be identical to if the untransformed \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) was evolved to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform changes the representation of the problem to the frequency domain and modifies how the differential equation behaves under this new representation. Even though the inverse transformation can reconstruct the temperature distribution in the spatial domain, the profiles are not identical due to the transformation affecting the propagation of frequency components differently.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial temperature distribution u_0(x) directly causes the temperature profile u(T) at time T and the frequency domain representation F(u)(ξ, T) at time T. The Laplacian Δ and heat source term c directly cause changes in the temperature distribution u. Applying the Fourier transform F to u_0(x) converts it to F(u)(ξ, T), but the evolution over time is consistent regardless of whether the transformation is applied initially or not."
