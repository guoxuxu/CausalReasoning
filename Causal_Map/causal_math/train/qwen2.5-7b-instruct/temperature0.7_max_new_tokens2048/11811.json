  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. Analyze the response of the function under an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{s} f(s) ds \\\\).\n\nCan the original pre-intervention form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) or the specific nature of any interventions be completely determined by evaluating only \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) at the end of the interval?",
  "Explanation": "The final value of the integral transformation is a cumulative measure that integrates the function over time, combining effects from both before and after the intervention. Since the transformation inherently mixes these effects, distinguishing between them from the end value alone is not possible without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
