  "Problem": "Consider an integral transformation defined by the kernel \\\\( K(x, s) = e^{-(x-s)^2} \\\\). This transformation is applied to a function \\\\( h(x) \\\\) to produce a new function \\\\( g(s) = \\\\int h(x) K(x, s) dx \\\\). Investigate the effects of the transformations and their reversibility across different conditions.\n\nCan we determine whether the transformation \\\\( p(x) = x^2 h(x) \\\\) was applied by examining \\\\( g(s) \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "Although the transformation by \\\\( p(x) \\\\) affects the resultant \\\\( g(s) \\\\), various different transformations might result in similar effects under the Gaussian kernel, due to its smoothing properties. Consequently, the specific intervention of squaring and multiplying by \\\\( h(x) \\\\) cannot be conclusively identified solely from the output \\\\( g(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
