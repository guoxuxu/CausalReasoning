  "Problem": "Consider a function \\(z(s)\\) defined over the complex plane and involving a parameter \\(s = x + yi\\) (where \\(i\\) is the imaginary unit). We are particularly interested in investigating how the transformation \\(H(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\, dt\\) (a Laplace transform) behaves with changes in the function \\(f(t)\\) used in the transform.\n\nIf \\(f(t)\\) is changed to \\(f(t) + g(t)\\) without any intervention in the variable \\(s\\) or \\(t\\), will \\(H(s)\\) merely become the sum of the Laplace transforms of \\(f(t)\\) and \\(g(t)\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The linearity of the Laplace transform ensures that the transform of the sum of two functions is the sum of their transforms, i.e., \\(H(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t) + g(t)\\} = \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\} + \\mathcal{L}\\{g(t)\\}\\). Therefore, changing \\(f(t)\\) to \\(f(t) + g(t)\\) adds the transforms directly.",
