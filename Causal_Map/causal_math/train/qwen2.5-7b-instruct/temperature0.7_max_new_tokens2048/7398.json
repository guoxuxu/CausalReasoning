  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) governed by the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\) where D is a diffusion constant. We are interested in the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) before the system evolves.\n\nCan the original function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) be unambiguously reconstructed from the Fourier transformed state \\\\( \\\\widehat{u}(k, T) \\\\) after evolution under the transformed PDE?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation and the diffusion process impact the information in \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\). Without explicit knowledge of the transformation and diffusion details applied, reconstructing the exact original function from its evolved Fourier transform counterpart involves ambiguities and potential loss of information.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u(x, 0) directly influences the function u(x, t) through the evolution described by the PDE. Applying the Fourier transform F to u(x, 0) results in F, which then influences u(x, t). The Fourier transform FT of the evolved function u(x, t) can be used to reconstruct u(x, 0) up to a multiplicative factor."
