  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions representing the real and imaginary parts, respectively. The system is subject to the operation \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) followed by an integral transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T} \\\\) defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T}[z](s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\).\n\nBased on the Laplace transform output, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T}[z](s) \\\\), can we determine whether the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was squared?",
  "Explanation": "The transform output, while a transformation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), does not inherently encode information about its prior forms directly - particularly nonlinear transformations such as squaring. Without additional constraints or data about the functional relationship or original form, one cannot definitively conclude the presence of the squaring operation merely from the Laplace transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
