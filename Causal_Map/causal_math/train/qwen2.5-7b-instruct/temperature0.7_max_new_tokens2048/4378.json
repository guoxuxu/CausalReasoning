  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(w) \\\\) which maps complex numbers under the transformation \\\\(z(w) = e^{iw}\\\\). We study its effects on waves modeled by the integral transformation \\\\(x(t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\pi}^{\\\\pi} z(w)e^{iwt} dw\\\\).\n\nAfter observing \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at time T, can one determine the initial form of the wave function before the transformation \\\\(z(w)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation \\\\(e^{iw}\\\\) modifies each frequency component's phase, it is generally not possible to uniquely reconstruct the original wave form solely from the transformed waveform at a later time, especially without knowledge of the phases affected by the initial transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
