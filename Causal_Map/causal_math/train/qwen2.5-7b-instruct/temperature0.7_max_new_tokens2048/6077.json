  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number, representing angular frequency. We examine the impact of the Laplace transform on this function and how it influences the causal structure of the resulting transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).\n\nIf the Laplace transform is applied to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), will the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) represent the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) equivalently in the frequency domain without any loss of information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), calculated as \\\\( \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{i\\omega t} e^{-st} dt \\\\), results in \\\\( \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\\\), which accurately corresponds to the original function in the frequency domain, encapsulating all information about \\\\( \\omega \\\\).",
