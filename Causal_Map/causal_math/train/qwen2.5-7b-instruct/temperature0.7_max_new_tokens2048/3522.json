  "Problem": "A system is controlled by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We assess the effect of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), where D is another constant matrix, on the system's behavior over time t.\n\nStarting from the observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) be accurately determined at t = 0 without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was used?",
  "Explanation": "If it is unknown whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, the alterations caused by the transformation \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) make it impossible to uniquely trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\). Depending on D's properties relative to M, the initial state could have been various possible vectors.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
