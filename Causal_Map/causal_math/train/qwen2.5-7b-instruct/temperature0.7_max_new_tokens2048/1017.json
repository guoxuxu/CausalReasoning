  "Problem": "Consider the impact of a linear transformation \\\\( L \\\\) represented as a matrix on a vector field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{x}(t) \\\\) under the flow given by \\\\( \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{x}} = M\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\), where M is a square matrix. The transformation applied is \\\\( \\\\mathbf{x}(0) = L\\\\mathbf{y} \\\\), and we are interested in evaluating how this affects the system dynamics.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( L \\\\) is applied at initial time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) to a vector \\\\( \\\\mathbf{y} \\\\), and the system is then allowed to evolve as \\\\( \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{x}} = M\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\) without additional intervention, will the vector field at time \\\\( t = T \\\\) be identical to evolving \\\\( \\\\mathbf{y} \\\\) directly under \\\\( \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{x}} = M\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\) for the same period?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( L \\\\) at the initial state alters the vector field's initial conditions. This modification changes the vector field's trajectory over time, likely leading to a different configuration at time \\\\( T \\\\), especially if \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\) do not commute.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "L → x(0); x(0) → x(t); M → dx/dt; x(T) → result",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of transformation L at t=0 causes the initial state x(0) to be L*y, which then evolves over time according to the dynamics defined by M, resulting in x(T). Without the transformation, y would evolve to x(T) under the same dynamics."
