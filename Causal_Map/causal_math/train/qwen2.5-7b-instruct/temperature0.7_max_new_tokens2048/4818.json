  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{gz} \\\\) where g is a complex constant. This function is used to transform the path of integration in the complex plane for the integral \\\\( I = \\\\int_C e^{z^2} dz \\\\), where C is initially the real axis from -∞ to +∞.\n\nKnowing the value of \\\\( I \\\\) computed along the transformed path \\\\( C' \\\\), can we unequivocally determine the original path \\\\( C \\\\) without any additional information about \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific knowledge about the transforming function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and the effect it has on the path, determining the original path solely based on the integral's resulting value is not feasible. The function could potentially map multiple different paths to a similar resultant path, or the integral might not provide enough information to infer the specifics of the original path.",
