  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{y(t)\\\\} \\\\), and a response function described by \\\\( R(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+p} \\\\) where p is a positive constant. The system's output is obtained by the convolution operation in the time domain corresponding to multiplication in the Laplace domain. We study the influence of a feedback mechanism introduced via a transformation \\\\( g(y) = e^{-kt}y \\\\), where k is a constant.\n\nKnowing the final output in the Laplace domain, \\\\( Y(T) \\\\), can we ascertain the exact nature and timing of the interventions (whether \\\\( g(y) \\\\) or any other functions) that were used?",
  "Explanation": "The final state in the Laplace domain, \\\\( Y(T) \\\\), could emerge from various potential transformations and timings, including different forms of \\\\( g(y) \\\\), applied at different times t1 with possibly different constants k. This introduces too many variables and potential overlaps in system characteristics to decisively pinpoint the interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The feedback mechanism g(y) directly influences Y(s), while t influences y(t), s transforms y(t) into Y(s), p defines the response function R(s), and k modulates the effect of g(y)."
