  "Problem": "Consider a multivariable control system governed by the matrix differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\), where M is a constant matrix. The function \\\\( h(x) = D \\\\exp(Mt)x \\\\), with D being another constant matrix, is applied to manipulate the system state over time t.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we infer the exact original state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "If the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) has been applied without our knowledge, D and M can alter the state in such a way that tracing back to \\\\( x_0 \\\\) accurately is impossible without explicit knowledge of D's application.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
