  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation system \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a complex number constant. The analysis focuses on the transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) where \\\\( Q \\\\) is another complex number constant.\n\nCan the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be deduced after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was used, and because \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\) might change the initial conditions and path in a way that cannot be uniquely reversed (since the effect of Q can interact with P), it's not possible to ascertain \\\\( z_0 \\\\) conclusively at t = 0.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial value z(0) directly influences z(t) through the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Pz\\\\). The constant Q affects f(z) which transforms z(t). Knowing z(t) at t=T allows inferring z(0) if f(z) is not applied, as z(t) = z(0)e^(Pt)."
