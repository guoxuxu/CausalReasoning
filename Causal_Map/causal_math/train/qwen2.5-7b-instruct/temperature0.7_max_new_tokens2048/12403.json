  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a complex constant. We analyze the behavior of this system when subjected to a Fourier transform, defined as \\\\( \\mathcal{F}(z)(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-i \\xi t} z(t) \\, dt \\\\).\n\nBy observing the peak of the Fourier transformed function after applying the damping factor, can we determine whether the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) or the damping coefficient \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) had a greater effect?",
  "Explanation": "The peak of the Fourier transform with a damping factor does not uniquely clarify the relative influence of \\\\( \\omega \\\\) versus \\\\( \\alpha \\\\). Both parameters crucially shape the transformed function's peak, and their effects are intertwined in the resulting spectrum.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The original frequency ω of z(t) influences the shape of the Fourier transformed function, which in turn affects the peak of the Fourier transformed function via the damping factor α."
