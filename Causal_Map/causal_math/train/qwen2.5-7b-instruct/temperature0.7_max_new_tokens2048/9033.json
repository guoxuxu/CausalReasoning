  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\( z(t) \\) evolving in time according to the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant. The effect of an integral transformation defined as \\( T(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt \\), with complex \\( s \\), is analyzed.\n\nIf the function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\) (where \\( z_0 \\) is the initial condition) evolves without any intervention, will the transform \\( T(z) \\) directly yield the same result irrespective of the choice of \\( \\omega \\) and \\( s \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transform \\( T(z) \\) heavily depends on the relation between \\( \\omega \\) and the real part of \\( s \\). Specifically, the integral convergence is conditional, depending on whether the real part of \\( s \\) is greater than \\( \\omega \\). Thus, changing \\( \\omega \\) or \\( s \\) can yield different results, indicating dependency.",
