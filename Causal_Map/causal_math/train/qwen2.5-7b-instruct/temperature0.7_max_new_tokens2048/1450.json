  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where t represents time. We investigate the influence of a Fourier transformation on this function, represented as \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\) over the frequency domain \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and observed frequency components, can we conclusively determine the time-varying behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without taking the inverse transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform shifts the information about time-domain behavior into the frequency domain, and without performing the inverse Fourier transformation, specifics of the time-domain behavior (like exact time-evolving phases or modifications in amplitude over time) remain indeterminate.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
