  "Problem": "Consider a system described by a linear transformation \\\\( y(t) = e^{At}y_0 \\\\), where A is a complex matrix and \\\\( y_0 \\\\) is the initial vector. We examine the effect of an integral transformation given by \\\\( g(y) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Bs}y(s) ds \\\\), where B is also a complex matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( g(y) \\\\) is applied to an initial vector \\\\( y_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and the system is then allowed to evolve under the transformation \\\\( y(t) = e^{At}y_0 \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( y(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( y_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( y(t) = e^{At}y_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( g(y) \\\\) introduces an integral component which accumulates the effects of \\\\( B \\\\), altering the trajectory from the pure exponential growth given by \\\\( e^{At}y_0 \\\\). Thus, the state at time T will differ, influenced by the history of the system through B.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial vector y_0 directly causes y(t) through the transformation y(t) = e^(At)y_0. The function g(y) indirectly influences y(t) by integrating over the transformation, but applying g(y) at t=0 does not change the final state y(T) at t=T when compared to directly evolving y_0 under y(t) = e^(At)y_0."
