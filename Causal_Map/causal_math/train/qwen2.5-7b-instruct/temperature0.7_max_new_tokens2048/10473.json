  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) applied to the set of complex numbers \\\\( z \\\\), and let's consider an integral transformation of this function, specifically the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\).\n\nIf a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) and then the Fourier transform is applied, will the outcome of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(f(z_0)) \\\\) be the same as directly applying the Fourier transform to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then squaring the variable in the frequency domain?",
  "Explanation": "Transforming \\\\( z_0 \\\\) by \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) changes the function prior to the transform application, affecting the Fourier transform result in a fundamentally different manner compared to squaring after the transform due to non-linear transformation properties and the convolution theorem.",
