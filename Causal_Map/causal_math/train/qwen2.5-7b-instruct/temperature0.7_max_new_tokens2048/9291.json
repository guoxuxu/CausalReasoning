  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) governed by \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iAz(t)\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a real constant and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. Analyze the impact of the transformation defined by \\\\(h(z) = e^{(iBt)}z\\\\), where \\\\(B\\\\) is another real constant, on the behavior of the function over time \\\\(t\\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( k(z) = e^{(iCt)}z \\\\) (where \\\\(C\\\\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on \\\\(A\\\\) and not on \\\\(B\\\\) or \\\\(C\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention alters the state by introducing another transformation defined by \\\\(C\\\\). As a result, the final state depends on the interplay and collective influence of \\\\(A\\\\), \\\\(B\\\\), and \\\\(C\\\\). The transformations through \\\\(e^{iBt}\\\\) and \\\\(e^{iCt}\\\\) contribute to a different trajectory and final position of \\\\(z(T)\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of z with respect to time is directly influenced by A. The transformation h(z) changes z but does not affect the value of A. Applying k(z) after h(z) at t1 does not alter the dependency of z's endpoint on A."
