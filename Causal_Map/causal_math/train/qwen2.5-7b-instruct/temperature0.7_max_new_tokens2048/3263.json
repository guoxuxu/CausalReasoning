  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) that solves the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz(t) + Q\\\\) with the initial condition \\\\(z(0) = z_0\\\\), where P is a constant matrix and Q a constant vector. We explore the impact of applying a Laplace transform to both sides of this equation.\n\nSuppose an additional function \\\\(h(t)\\\\), which is another solution to a different differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dh}{dt} = Rh(t)\\\\), is applied as an intervention by multiplying it with \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at time \\\\(t_1\\\\). Will the resulting function at time \\\\(T\\\\), where \\\\(T > t_1\\\\), accurately describe the original dynamics dictated only by \\\\(P\\\\) and \\\\(Q\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by multiplication with a function from a different differential equation introduces a new dynamic dependent on \\\\(R\\\\). The resulting function at time \\\\(T\\\\) is a mixture of the effects from \\\\(P\\\\), \\\\(Q\\\\), and additionally \\\\(R\\\\). This complex interaction changes the trajectory and final state of the system, making it a representation of combined system dynamics rather than solely from \\\\(P\\\\) and \\\\(Q\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of z(t) depends on P and z(t), and is influenced by Q. Introducing h(t) through multiplication with z(t) at t1 modifies z(t) but does not inherently alter the original dynamics dictated solely by P and Q after T > t1."
