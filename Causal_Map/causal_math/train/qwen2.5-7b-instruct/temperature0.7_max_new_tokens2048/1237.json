  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with an inductor, capacitor, and resistor (LCR circuit) where its behavior is described by the differential equation \\\\(L \\\\frac{d^2i}{dt^2} + R \\\\frac{di}{dt} + \\\\frac{1}{C}i = 0\\\\). An external voltage source \\\\(V(t) = V_0 e^{st}\\\\) is considered as a function transformation applying to the system.\n\nIf the external voltage source \\\\(V(t)\\\\) is applied at t = 0 and the system evolves without further intervention, will the current \\\\(i(t)\\\\) at t = T follow the same solution path as the homogeneous solution to the differential equation without the voltage source?",
  "Explanation": "The external voltage source changes the system's driving function, leading to a particular solution that adds to the homogeneous solution, thereby altering the total response of the system at any time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the external voltage source V(t) directly influences the current i(t) through the differential equation. The inductance L, resistance R, and capacitance 1/C each directly affect the rate of change of the current i(t)."
