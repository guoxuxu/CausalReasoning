  "Problem": "Analyze the system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\), within a certain region. Consider a transformation by the function \\\\(f(u) = e^{ikx} u\\\\) where k is a constant and x represents a spatial variable.\n\nIf \\\\(f(u)\\\\) is applied to a function \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) at x = 0, and the system is then allowed to evolve under the Laplace equation without further intervention, will \\\\(u(x)\\\\) for a given x be the same as if \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) was directly used?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(f(u)\\\\) modifies the initial function, which could affect the harmonic properties of the function. Since \\\\(e^{ikx}\\\\) represents a wave-like multiplication, it introduces additional spatial fluctuations; hence, the transformed function might not satisfy the Laplace equation unless adjusted or further constrained.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation f(u0) = e^(ikx) * u0 to u0 at x=0 results in u, which then evolves under the Laplace equation to produce the same u(x) as if u0 had been used directly."
