  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\(z(t) = Xe^{i\\omega t} + Ye^{-i\\omega t}\\\\), where X and Y are complex constants and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the impact of applying Fourier transformation on this signal and then modifying its spectrum by a filter function \\\\(H(\\omega)\\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\(\\mathcal{F}\\\\) of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is calculated and then directly inverse Fourier transformed without modifying the spectrum, will the reconstructed signal \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) be the same as the original \\\\(z(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform and its inverse are inverses of each other. Thus, applying the Fourier transform followed directly by its inverse without altering the spectrum will reconstruct the original signal exactly, assuming ideal conditions and no information loss.",
