  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the Laplace Transform equation \\\\( Y(s) = H(s)X(s) \\\\), where \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is a known system transfer function. We explore the scenario using an additional feedback transformation defined by \\\\( G(y) = \\\\frac{1}{s+1}Y(s) \\\\), which modifies the output.\n\nCan we infer the initial input \\\\( X(s) \\\\) after observing the output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) without knowing if the feedback \\\\( G(y) \\\\) was applied prior",
  "Explanation": "The potential application and effect of the feedback transformation \\\\( G(y) = \\\\frac{1}{s+1}Y(s) \\\\) modifies the output depending on its inclusion. Without the certainty about its application, accurately tracing back to \\\\( X(s) \\\\) from \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) is not possible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The feedback transformation G(y) directly influences Y(s), and the system transfer function H(s) also directly influences Y(s). Conversely, Y(s) can be used to infer X(s)."
