  "Problem": "Consider the impact of a transformation on a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is an initial complex number. The transformation is defined by the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant and t is time.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to T under \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) modifies the initial condition by scaling it, which changes the magnitude and possibly the phase of the initial state. Therefore, the trajectory and the final state at time T will differ from the unaltered state evolution.",
