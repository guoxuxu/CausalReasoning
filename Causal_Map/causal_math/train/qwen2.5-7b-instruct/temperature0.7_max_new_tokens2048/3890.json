  "Problem": "Consider a complex function represented by \\\\( z = x + yi \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are real numbers and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The function to analyze is \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant complex number. The transformations are evaluated for their effect on the magnitude and phase of \\\\( z \\\\) over a variable \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nCan we determine the original value of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) without knowing if \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) has been applied, the changes in magnitude and phase induced by the  transformation function \\\\( e^{az} \\\\) make it impossible to unambiguously determine the initial value of \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The exponential impact of \\\\( a \\\\) modifies \\\\( z \\\\) in a non-invertible way over time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
