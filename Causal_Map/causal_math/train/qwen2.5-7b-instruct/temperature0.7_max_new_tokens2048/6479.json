  "Problem": "A vector field $V(z)$ in the complex plane behaves according to the equation $V(z) = z^n$ where $n$ is an integer. We examine the consequences of applying a transformation $f(z) = e^{i \\theta}z$ where $\\theta$ is a constant angle.\n\nIf at a certain time $t_1$, a new function $g(z) = e^{i \\phi}z$ (where $\\phi$ is a constant angle) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint $V(z(T))$ for $T > t_1$ depend only on $n$ and not on $\\theta$ or $\\phi$?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with $g(z)$ introduces another angle of rotation, making the final state $V(z(T))$ dependent not only on $n$ but also on $\\theta$ and $\\phi$. The effects of the transformations $e^{i \\theta}z$ and $e^{i \\phi}z$ cannot be independently negated or isolated, affecting the final output.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The endpoint V(z(T)) depends on n but is independent of both θ and φ due to the transformations f(z) and g(z) being rotations which do not affect the power term z^n."
