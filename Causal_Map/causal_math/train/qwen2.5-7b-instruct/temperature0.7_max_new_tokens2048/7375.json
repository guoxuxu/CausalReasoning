  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix. The transformation specified by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\), where N is another constant complex matrix, is applied to study the behavior of the function over time t.\n\nIf a new transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Kt}z \\\\) (where K is a constant complex matrix) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention, will the resulting state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be solely determined by M, independent of N or K?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces additional complexity to the system, affecting the trajectory and final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The outcome depends not only on M but also on the interplay between N and K, as these transformations may have non-trivial, non-commuting effects that influence the system's evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The matrix M directly influences z(T), while the matrices N and K indirectly influence z(T) through their respective transformations, but after the intervention at t_1, only M determines z(T)'s state for T > t_1."
