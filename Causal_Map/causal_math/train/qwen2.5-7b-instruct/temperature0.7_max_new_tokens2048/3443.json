  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions describing a particle's position in a two-dimensional plane over time t. The transformation defined by the integral \\\\( w(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{st}z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where s is a complex constant, is analyzed.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( v(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{rt}z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) (where r is a different complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the state \\\\( w(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the original transformation and not on r?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention introduces another integral transformation with a new complex exponent, \\\\( r \\\\). This changes the weighting and integration of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from t_1 to T, altering the trajectory from its course solely defined by s. Hence, the final state depends on both s and r.",
