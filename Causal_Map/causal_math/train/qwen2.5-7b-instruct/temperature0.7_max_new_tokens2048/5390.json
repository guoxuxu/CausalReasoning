  "Problem": "Consider a linear system defined by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We explore the implications of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) = \\\\hat{u} \\\\) to the system, affecting the solution characteristics over time t.\n\nCan we determine the initial function \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether the Fourier transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the Fourier transform was applied, it's challenging to reverse engineer the initial condition \\\\( u_0 \\\\) because the transform could have altered the frequency spectrum, impacting how L acts on the original function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial function u_0 directly influences u(t) through the Fourier transform F(u_0) which results in hat{u}, and hat{u} further influences u(t) over time t."
