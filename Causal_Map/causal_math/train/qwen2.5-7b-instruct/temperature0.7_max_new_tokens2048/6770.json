  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined as \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts respectively. This function is subjected to a Fourier transform, resulting in \\\\( F(z)(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty z(t)e^{-i\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the exact original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) after observing its Fourier transform \\\\( F(z)(\\omega) \\\\) without knowing the initial scalar modification at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform will display scaling according to the scalar \\\\( \\alpha \\\\), but since \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) is unknown, multiple potential original functions could result in the same transformed output, depending on their initial amplitude. Thus, the original function remains undetermined without additional information.",
