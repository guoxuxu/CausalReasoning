  "Problem": "Consider the response of an electrical system characterized by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a matrix describing the system dynamics. The system undergoes a transformation with \\\\( h(x) = Ce^{-Dt}x \\\\), where C and D are constant matrices. The transformations impact the behavior of the system over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied to an initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then it is allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\) without any further intervention, will \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to having evolved \\\\( x_0 \\\\) directly to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) modifies the initial condition from \\\\( x_0 \\\\) to \\\\( Ce^{-Dt}x_0 \\\\) at t = 0. This change affects how the state evolves according to \\\\( M \\\\), likely resulting in a different state at time T due to the initial multiplication by \\\\( C \\\\) and the exponential factor of \\\\( D \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation h(x) to the initial state x_0 at t=0 and allowing it to evolve under Mx results in the same state x(t) at time t=T as if x_0 had evolved directly under Mx from t=0 to t=T."
