  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We look into the effect of a transformation described by \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) applied to the complex plane.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation function \\\\( k(z) = z + 1 \\\\) is used as an intervention, will the state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be independent of the initial transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( k(z) \\\\) adds a shift to the complex number which compounds with the initial transformation effect of \\\\( h(z) \\\\). This makes the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on the earlier squared state plus the subsequent shift, reflecting the impacts of both transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

The transformation k(z) directly causes z+1. At time t_1, the transformation k(z) is used as an intervention, which does not affect the independence of z(T) from the initial transformation h(z)."
