  "Problem": "Analyze the transformation of a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, where \\\\( z(x) = x^2 + i \\\\) and \\\\( x \\\\) is a real variable. The impact of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ z(t) \\\\} = Z(s) \\\\) on this function is examined over a variable s, which is a complex number.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( Z(T) \\\\), can we accurately determine what transformations were applied (whether \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ z(t) \\\\} \\\\), \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\{ z(t) \\\\} \\\\), or both), only by analyzing the final value \\\\( Z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final form \\\\( Z(T) \\\\) might arise from different combinations or sequences of transformations due to the overlapping effects and non-trivial interactions between the transforms in a complex frequency domain. This ambiguity prevents the precise identification of specific transformations used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function z(x) transforms into Z(s) via the Laplace transform, and Z(T) represents the endpoint of this transformation, potentially indicating the nature of transformations applied (Laplace or Fourier) but not definitively without additional context."
