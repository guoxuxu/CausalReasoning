  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_t + pu_x = 0 \\\\), with p being a constant. We explore the consequences of applying the Fourier transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-ikx}u(x,t) dx \\\\), to the function u(x, t).\n\nIf an operation defined by another transform, say Laplace, is applied as an intervention at time \\\\(T_1\\\\), will the final form of \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > \\\\(T_1\\\\) be independent of the initial Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of another transformation such as the Laplace transform at time \\\\(T_1\\\\) further alters the evolution of the original function u(x, t). The final state at time T depends on both transformations, making the system’s behavior from T1 to T dependent on the compounded effects of both the Fourier and Laplace transforms.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "u(x, t) → u(x, T); Fourier_transform(u(x, t)) → u_hat(k, t); Laplace intervene(t=T1) → u(x, T) for T > T1",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Fourier transform to u(x, t) results in u_hat(k, t), and intervening with the Laplace transform at time T1 does not affect the final form of u(x, T) for T > T1, meaning the final u(x, T) is independent of the initial Fourier transform."
