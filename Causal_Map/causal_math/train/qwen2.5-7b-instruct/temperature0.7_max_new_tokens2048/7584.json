  "Problem": "Suppose we analyze the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{tA}x + \\int_0^t e^{(t-s)A}Bu(s) \\, ds \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a control input. This system reflects the solution to a linear time-invariant dynamic system with input.\n\nKnowing only the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to deduce exactly what changes or interventions were applied to \\\\( u(t) \\\\) during [0, T]?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional information about how the input was modified or the specifics of the interventions, multiple input trajectories can lead to the identical final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The solution's dependency on both the history and the nature of \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( A \\\\), in the integral, make this determination non-unique.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
