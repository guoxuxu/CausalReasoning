  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant, representing angular frequency. An integral transformation defined by \\( T(z) = \\int_{0}^t e^{-i\\omega s}z(s) \\, ds \\) is applied to study its properties over time \\( t \\).\n\nIf \\( T(z) \\) is applied to \\( z(t) \\) initially at t = 0 and allowed to evolve according to \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\) without further intervention, will \\( z(T) \\) at a later time T be affected by this transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( T(z) \\) does not alter the evolution of \\( z(t) \\); it computes an integral which depends on the history of \\( z(s) \\) but does not influence the future trajectory governed by \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\), thus \\( z(T) \\) will evolve as if \\( T(z) \\) was not applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The angular frequency ω determines the behavior of z(t), which in turn influences the integral transformation T(z) and the time variable t dictates the scope of the transformation."
