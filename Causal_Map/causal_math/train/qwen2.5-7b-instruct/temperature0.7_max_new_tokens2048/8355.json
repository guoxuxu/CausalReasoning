  "Problem": "We analyze a mechanical system where the position \\( x(t) \\) of a mass evolves according to the differential equation \\( \\ddot{x} = -kx \\), a simple harmonic oscillator, where \\( k \\) is a positive constant. We introduce transformations via \\( f(x) = A \\sin(Bx) \\) at different instances to investigate causal influences.\n\nIf at time \\( t_1 \\), an additional transformation \\( g(x) = C \\cos(Dx) \\) is applied, will the final state \\( x(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depend exclusively on the original differential equation (\\( -kx \\)) parameters and not on \\( A, B, C, \\) or \\( D \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( g(x) \\) at \\( t_1 \\) introduces yet another alteration to the state of the system. This change in conditions impacts the trajectory and final state \\( x(T) \\) in a manner dependent on \\( C \\) and \\( D \\), in addition to the transformations made by \\( f(x) \\). The final state \\( x(T) \\) thus depends on these interventions in conjunction with the original system parameters.",
