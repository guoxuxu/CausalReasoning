  "Problem": "Consider a control system represented by the linear differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx + Nu\\\\), where \\\\(M\\\\) and \\\\(N\\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\(u(t)\\\\) represents a control input. Analyze the effects of applying the Laplace transform, denoted by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\), on this system.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform of \\\\(x(t)\\\\) as \\\\(X(s)\\\\) from t = 0 to T, can we deduce the exact nature of the control input \\\\(u(t)\\\\) used?",
  "Explanation": "Although the Laplace transform \\\\(X(s)\\\\) provides information on the overall system dynamics, it does not explicitly reveal the specific time-domain function of \\\\(u(t)\\\\) unless additional information about the system (like zero initial conditions or specific forms of \\\\(u(t)\\\\)) is known.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The control input u(t) directly influences the state x(t), and the Laplace transform of x(t) (denoted as X(s)) is a representation of x(t) in the frequency domain."
