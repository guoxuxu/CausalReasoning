  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\) which is transformed via a complex function \\\\( g(z) = z^2 + c \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a complex constant. The function \\\\( f \\\\) maps inputs from a two-dimensional space into the complex plane, and \\\\( g \\\\) transforms these complex numbers over time t.\n\nGiven the output at time T, \\\\( z(T) \\\\), and knowing an intervention occurred at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), can we determine with certainty whether the original transformation was \\\\( g \\\\) or \\\\( g' \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The ability to determine which transformation was applied originally is compromised by the intervention. Given the non-linear, sensitive dependence on initial conditions and parameter values, pinpointing whether \\\\( g \\\\) or \\\\( g' \\\\) (before \\\\( t_1 \\\\)) was used originally cannot be definitively resolved from the output at \\\\( T \\\\) alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
