  "Problem": "Consider the response of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cy + Du \\\\), respectively. A transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ft}z \\\\), involving a complex matrix F, is applied at different instances.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cy + Du \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T evolve identically as it would without the initial application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ft}z_0 \\\\) modifies the initial conditions by scaling and rotating the state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in the complex plane, which significantly alters the trajectory under the given system dynamics, leading to a potentially different state at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
