  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) affected by a linear time-dependent operator \\\\( L(t) = Ae^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real scalar. The evolution of the system without interventions follows the integral equation \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t L(s)z(s) ds + z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial condition.\n\nIf the system starts at \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and evolves up to time \\\\( T \\\\), will the transformation \\\\( L(t)z(t) \\\\) over the interval lead to the same outcome as directly applying the integral transformation for \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without integrating stepwise?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( L(t) \\\\) interacts continuously with the evolving function, influencing its path at every incremental time step. Directly applying \\\\( L(T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) does not account for the ongoing alterations in state caused by the integral of \\\\( L(s)z(s) \\\\) over \\\\( s \\\\) from 0 to \\\\( T \\\\). Thus, the outcomes will differ.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The linear time-dependent operator L(t) directly influences the evolution of z(t), and the initial condition z_0 sets the starting point for z(t) at time t. As time progresses from 0 to T, the transformation L(t)z(t) over the interval leads to the same outcome as directly applying the integral transformation for z(T) without integrating stepwise."
