  "Problem": "The system under study is governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) represents a linear differential operator. The impact of an integral transformation represented by the convolution \\\\( u \\\\ast K \\\\), where \\\\(K\\\\) is a kernel function, is analyzed.\n\nAfter observing the state \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we deduce the initial function \\\\( u_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the convolution \\\\( u \\\\ast K \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information regarding the application of the convolution \\\\( u \\\\ast K \\\\), it is unclear whether the observed state incorporates modification by the kernel \\\\(K\\\\). This uncertainty about the initial transformation makes it impossible to accurately trace back to \\\\( u_0 \\\\) without additional data on the intervening transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
