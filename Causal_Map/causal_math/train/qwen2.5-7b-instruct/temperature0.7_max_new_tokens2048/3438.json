  "Problem": "Consider a matrix function \\( z(t) \\) associated with a complex function \\( f(z) = z^2 \\), where \\( z \\) evolves over time according to the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = -iz \\). We examine how an eigenvalue transformation \\( F(z) = e^{\\lambda t}z \\) affects \\( z(t) \\), with \\( \\lambda \\) being a complex constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0 after observing \\( z(t) \\) at t = T without knowing whether \\( F(z) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about the application of \\( F(z) \\), and considering the influence of \\( \\lambda \\) on the evolution, it is not feasible to retrieve \\( z_0 \\) uniquely; the observed \\( z(t) \\) could result from various initial conditions altered by different \\( \\lambda \\) values.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial value of z at t=0 influences its value at t=T. The eigenvalue transformation F(z) applied to z at t=0 results in a new value of z at t=T. Knowing z(T) allows us to infer the effect of F(z) but does not directly reveal z(0) without additional information."
