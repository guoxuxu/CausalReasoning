  "Problem": "Consider a system modelled by a second-order linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} + p \\\\dot{x} + qx = 0 \\\\), where p and q are constants. We introduce a Fourier transform of the displacement function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) to investigate its behavior in the frequency domain.\n\nIf the initial displacement function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed using the Fourier transform and then analyzed without applying any inverse transformation, can the stability of the system be directly inferred from the transformed function?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform converts the function into the frequency domain, which represents the system's behavior differently from its time-domain counterpart. Fundamental attributes like stability, which depend on time-domain dynamics and characteristic equation \\\\( \\\\lambda^2 + p\\\\lambda + q = 0 \\\\), cannot be solely determined without considering the inverse transformation or additional time-domain analysis.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The magnitude squared of the Fourier transform of the displacement function |x(k)|^2, directly influences the stability of the system, which in turn is determined by the constants p and q in the differential equation."
