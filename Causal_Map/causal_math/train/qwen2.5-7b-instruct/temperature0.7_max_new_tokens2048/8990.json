  "Problem": "Consider the application of a Fourier transform to a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) represented as \\\\( g(t) = ae^{bt} \\\\), where a and b are constants. We analyze the impact of this transformation over time when the transformed function \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\) is combined with another transformed function under different scenarios.\n\nIf only \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\) at some frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is known, can we reliably reconstruct \\\\( g(t) = ae^{bt} \\\\) and determine the parameters a and b without knowing they came from a Fourier transformation?",
  "Explanation": "While the inverse Fourier transform can theoretically reconstruct \\\\( g(t) \\\\) from \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\), the parameters a and b cannot be uniquely determined if the cause of their transformation (i.e., the Fourier transform) isn't specifically known, because effects of similar transformations like Laplace might lead to ambiguity.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Fourier transform G(ω) of g(t) influences the reconstruction of g(t) and the determination of its parameters a and b. The frequency ω is related to the Fourier transform G(ω). The constants a and b directly cause g(t). Knowing G(ω) at a specific frequency allows us to infer the form of g(t) and estimate the parameters a and b."
