  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x + e^{iBt}y \\\\) where x and y are constant vectors and A, B are constant matrices. The function describes the evolution of a vector in a complex plane subjected to two rotational effects.\n\nIf an intervention is applied at time t1 where \\\\( z \\\\) is transformed by a function \\\\( h(z) = e^{iCt}z \\\\), will the resulting state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t1 depend solely on the original matrices A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( h(z) = e^{iCt}z \\\\) introduces an additional rotational effect governed by matrix C. This new effect changes the subsequent trajectory and makes the state at time T dependent not only on A and B but also on C.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
