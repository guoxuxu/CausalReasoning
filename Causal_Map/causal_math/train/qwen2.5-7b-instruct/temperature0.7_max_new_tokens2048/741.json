  "Problem": "Assume a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions solving the system of differential equations given by \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = -v + cu \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = u + cv \\\\), where c is a real constant. We investigate the effect of an initial transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a constant real number.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and the system evolves under the given differential equations without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) evolved directly under the given differential equations to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state by rotating the complex plane, which affects the trajectory of both \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\). As a result, the dynamics of the system are altered, producing a different outcome at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the transformation f(z) to the initial vector z_0 at t=0 influences z(t) such that each component u(t) and v(t) of z(t) evolves according to the given differential equations. Without further intervention, z(t) at t=T after applying f(z) to z_0 is equivalent to the direct evolution of z_0 under the differential equations to t=T."
