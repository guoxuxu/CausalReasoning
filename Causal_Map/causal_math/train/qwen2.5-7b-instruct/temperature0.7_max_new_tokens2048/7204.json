  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We will explore how the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\int_0^t e^{sA}z(s) \\, ds \\\\), with A being a real constant, influences the behavior of the function over time t.\n\nFrom the final observation of the function at \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to precisely backtrack and determine which transformations (\\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) were applied during the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The combined effects of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\) through integration and additive transformations can deliver similar final states from different paths of intervention. The complexities introduced by these transformations, especially with non-linear effects and overlapping impacts, make it impractical to exactly distinguish between or identify the sequence of transformations applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The angular frequency ω determines the form of z(t), and the transformation g(z) influences the value of z(T) over time t."
