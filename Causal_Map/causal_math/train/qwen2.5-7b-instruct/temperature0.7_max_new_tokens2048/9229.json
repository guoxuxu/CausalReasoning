  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a differential operator. We examine the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the system, which alters the representation to depend on frequency variables \\\\( \\omega \\\\).\n\nIf a Fourier transform \\\\( \\mathcal{F} \\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\( u_0 \\\\) and then the system evolves according to \\\\( \\\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = Lu \\\\) without intervention, will the solution at time t = T, \\\\( u(T) \\\\), be equivalent in the time domain to directly evolving \\\\( u_0 \\\\) under \\\\( Lu \\\\) to time T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform changes the domain from time to frequency, and hence, the evolution under \\\\( Lu \\\\) in the Fourier domain may not correspond identically to the time-domain evolution due to the potential for differing treatment by \\\\( L \\\\) in the frequency domain. Thus, inverse transforming \\\\( u(T) \\\\) will not necessarily give the same results as evolving in the time domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u_0 directly influences the solution u(T) in the time domain. Applying a Fourier transform to u_0 changes its representation to the frequency domain, from which u(T) can be obtained through inverse transformation. Without Fourier transform, u_0 evolves directly under the operator L to produce u(T)."
