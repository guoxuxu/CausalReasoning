  "Problem": "Consider a physical system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D\\\\nabla^2 u \\\\), where D is a diffusion constant. We analyze the influence of a transformation defined by the integral operator \\\\( T(u) = \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}(e^{-k^2 t} \\\\mathcal{F}(u)) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is the Fourier transform, on the temporal evolution of \\\\( u \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( T(u) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve without further intervention under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D\\\\nabla^2 u \\\\), will \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) was evolved directly to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D\\\\nabla^2 u \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(u) \\\\) modifies the initial condition by applying a filtering effect that attenuates certain frequencies due to the operation \\\\( e^{-k^2 t} \\\\) in the Fourier domain. This change in the spectrum of the initial function generally results in different evolution under the diffusion equation, affecting the state at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the transformation T(u) followed by evolution under the diffusion equation leads to the same u(x,t) as direct evolution under the diffusion equation."
