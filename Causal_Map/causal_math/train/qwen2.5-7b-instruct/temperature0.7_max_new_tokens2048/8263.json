  "Problem": "Consider a stochastic differential equation given by \\\\(dX_t = \\mu X_t dt + \\sigma X_t dW_t\\\\) where \\\\(W_t\\\\) is a standard Brownian motion, \\\\(\\mu\\\\) is the drift coefficient, and \\\\(\\sigma\\\\) is the volatility coefficient. We explore the effect of a transformation described by \\\\( Z_t = e^{\\lambda t}X_t \\\\) for some constant \\\\(\\lambda\\\\).\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a modification to the drift coefficient from \\\\(\\mu\\\\) to \\\\(\\mu'\\\\) is introduced as an intervention, will the subsequent path of \\\\( Z_t \\\\) for t > t_1 depend only on the new \\\\(\\mu'\\\\) and not on the initial transformation constant \\\\(\\lambda\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The path of \\\\( Z_t \\\\) for t > t_1 will depend both on the new \\\\(\\mu'\\\\) and the constant \\\\(\\lambda\\\\). The scaling \\\\( e^{\\lambda t} \\\\) continues to influence the trajectory alongside the modified dynamics introduced by the new drift coefficient \\\\(\\mu'\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The drift coefficient μ' directly influences the change in X_t, which in turn directly influences the change in Z_t. The transformation constant λ directly influences Z_t."
