  "Problem": "Consider a function defined as \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{izt} g(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( g(t) \\\\) represents a function of time. This scenario deals with the Fourier transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and explores what happens as this transformation is applied to different functional forms of \\\\( g(t) \\\\).\n\nIf the modified Fourier transform shows broadened spectral lines, can we confidently identify the exact nature (type and magnitude) of the damping intervention introduced?",
  "Explanation": "Although broadened spectral lines suggest some form of damping, the exact parameters of the damping (such as the specific value of \\\\( a \\\\) in \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\)) cannot be precisely determined without additional information about the pre-damping state of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) or without controlling other experimental variables.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
