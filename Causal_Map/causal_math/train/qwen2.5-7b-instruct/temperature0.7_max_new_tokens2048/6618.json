  "Problem": "Analyze a system where the temperature distribution along the line, u(x,t), is governed by the heat equation \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\), where k is the diffusivity constant. We consider the impact of the transformation defined by the function \\\\(g(u) = u + v\\\\), where v is a constant scalar added at a specific time t.\n\nCan we deduce the original temperature distribution \\\\(u_0\\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\(g(u)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\(g(u) = u + v\\\\) was applied, it is impossible to determine whether the observed temperature distribution at t = T originated from \\\\(u_0\\\\) or \\\\(u_0 + v\\\\). This indeterminacy arises because the scalar shift v could have modified the initial state in a way that is not detectable only from later temperature observations.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The temperature distribution u(x,t) at time t depends on the initial temperature distribution u_0. Applying the transformation g(u) = u + v changes u(x,t), but without knowledge of g(u), it is possible to deduce u_0 from u(x,t) if g(u) was not applied."
