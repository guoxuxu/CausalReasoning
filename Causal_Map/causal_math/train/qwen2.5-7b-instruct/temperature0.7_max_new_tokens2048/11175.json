  "Problem": "Consider a function defined over a complex domain \\\\( z \\\\) described as \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + cz \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a complex constant. We analyze the impact of a complex transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a real number representing rotation in the complex plane.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the angles in the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) are adjusted (intervened) by another function \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\phi}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) is a real number different from \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\), will the resultant \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the original \\\\( c \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduce another modifying rotation, making the final complex number \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent not only on \\\\( c \\\\) but also on both angles \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\). These transformations can affect the trajectory in complex plane and consequently alter the end result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The resultant z(T) for T > t_1 depends on the original c through g(z) → z(T) and is also influenced by h(z) → z(T), but the specific values of θ and φ do not independently affect z(T) once the transformation has been applied."
