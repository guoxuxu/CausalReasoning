  "Problem": "Consider a complex function of the form \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. A linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) is defined such that \\\\( Lz = \\\\frac{dz}{dt} + \\\\alpha z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant. We investigate how \\\\( L \\\\) affects the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) an intervention using a new operator \\\\( M \\\\) defined as \\\\( Mz = \\\\frac{d^2z}{dt^2} - \\\\beta z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a constant, is applied, will the outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the original operator \\\\( L \\\\) and not on \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention using operator \\\\( M \\\\) contributes an additional alteration to the system by changing the frequency and amplitude characteristics through its differential operation. It not only affects the original trajectory but also introduces new dynamics combining with or contrary to the effects of operator \\\\( L \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of operator L affects the rate of change of z(t) and z(t) itself, while the application of operator M affects the second derivative of z(t) and z(t). The outcome z(T) for T > t_1 depends on both L and M."
