  "Problem": "Evaluate how the Laplace Transform impacts the causality between a pair of functions \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\), where \\( v(t) = t^2 \\) and \\( u(t) \\) is its derivative using the relation \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f'(t)\\} = sF(s) - f(0) \\), where \\( F(s) \\) is the Laplace Transform of \\( f(t) \\).\n\nGiven \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{Au(t)\\} \\), can we determine if the transformation applied was \\( A \\) and what the original function \\( v(t) \\) was, solely from \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{Au(t)\\} \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The influence of matrix \\( A \\) and the overlapping characteristics of different potential original functions \\( v(t) \\) that could produce similar derivatives \\( u(t) \\) make it problematic to uniquely identify both the transformation \\( A \\) and the original function \\( v(t) \\) from \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{Au(t)\\} \\) solely.",
