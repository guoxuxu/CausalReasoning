  "Problem": "Consider a functional transformation in a complex plane defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\). Analyze the evolution of values under the transformation and its implications with and without external interventions.\n\nGiven the final complex number after applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and an additional transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\), can one determine if the interventions were applied in the sequence \\\\( f \\\\) then \\\\( g \\\\), or if they were used in reverse or not used in conjunction?",
  "Explanation": "The non-trivial interplay between adding a constant in the exponential function's phase (via \\\\( g(z) \\\\)) and the sequence of applications (whether \\\\( f \\\\) then \\\\( g \\\\) or \\\\( g \\\\) then \\\\( f \\\\) or both at once) results in different paths that could lead to the same outcome. Therefore, it is impossible to definitively ascertain the sequence of interventions solely by the final state.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying f(z) transforms z to a new complex number which can then be further transformed by g(z). The order of application of f(z) and g(z) affects the final complex number, and knowing the final complex number does not directly reveal the sequence of transformations unless additional information is provided."
