  "Problem": "Consider a system undergoing complex function transformations governed by \\\\( z(t) = f(z), \\\\) where \\\\( f(z) = ze^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) a constant. We analyze how integral transformations like the Laplace transform affect the trajectory over time.\n\nIf an intervention involving another transformation \\\\( g(z) = ze^{-i\\\\beta t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a constant, is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the trajectory at time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on \\\\( f(z) \\\\) without being influenced by \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces another phase-modifying term, affecting the trajectory significantly. The end result, especially in complex domains, depends non-trivially on both transformations, \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\), leading to interaction effects that alter the original function's intended impact.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
