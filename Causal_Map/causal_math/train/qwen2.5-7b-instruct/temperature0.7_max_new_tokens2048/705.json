  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We explore the impact of applying a Fourier transform to this function, represented as \\\\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\} \\), which converts it from the time domain to the frequency domain.\n\nIf the Fourier transform is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any further modifications, does the resulting function in the frequency domain represent a delta function centered at \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), namely \\\\( \\mathcal{F}\\{e^{i \\omega t}\\} \\), results in a delta function \\\\( \\delta(\\xi - \\omega) \\\\). This transform directly maps the time-based exponential to a frequency-specific point, reflecting the constant frequency component \\\\( \\omega \\\\) in the time-domain signal.",
