  "Problem": "Consider a thermal system where the temperature \\\\( T(x, t) \\\\) at a point \\\\( x \\\\) and time \\\\( t \\\\) is governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We examine the effect of a transformation defined by \\\\( f(T) = T + \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a frequency constant.\n\nGiven the temperature distribution \\\\( T(x, T) \\\\) at time \\\\( t = T \\\\), can we determine if the initial profile was subject to \\\\( f(T) \\\\) or if it evolved naturally under the heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "The evolved temperature profile \\\\( T(x, T) \\\\) incorporates the effects of diffusion, making it complex to precisely delineate the initial transformation by \\\\( f(T) \\\\) due to the heat dissipation and potential overlap of effects from natural and transformed initial conditions.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation f(T) directly causes changes in T. The temperature distribution T(x, t) at time t influences the temperature T(x, T) at a specific time T. The thermal diffusivity k directly causes changes in the spatial second derivative of temperature ∂²T/∂x². Time t directly causes changes in the temporal first derivative of temperature ∂T/∂t."
