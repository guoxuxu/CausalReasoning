  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the coupled differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), and matrices A, B, C, and D are constants. We investigate the application of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) for a constant \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the given differential equations without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the differential equations?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) will initially rotate the complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in the complex plane. This changes the trajectory of both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\), suggesting that the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will differ by a phase factor of \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega T} \\\\), in addition to the effects introduced by the linear system dynamics.",
