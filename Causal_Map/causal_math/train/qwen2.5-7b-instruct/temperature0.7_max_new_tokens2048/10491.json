  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{kt} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. The system dynamics are further influenced by a transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^m \\\\), where \\\\( m \\\\) is a positive integer.\n\nIf an intervention is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) changing the evolution function to \\\\( z(t) = e^{lt} \\\\) (where \\\\( l \\\\) is a new complex constant), will the system state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( k \\\\) and not on \\\\( m \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention changes the evolution dynamics to \\\\( z(t) = e^{lt} \\\\). Given an initial state affected by \\\\( h(z) \\\\), the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) results from the compounded effect of the initial transformation and the pathway alteration at \\\\( t_1 \\\\). Thus, both \\\\( m \\\\) from the transformation and \\\\( l \\\\) impact the system's endpoint.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
