  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant real number, representing angular frequency. We analyze the system under a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z)(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i \\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nAfter obtaining the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z)(\\omega) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the original time-domain function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) if no information on modifications or initial conditions is given?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is a bijective operation for classes of functions typically studied in engineering and physics, which means each frequency-domain representation corresponds uniquely to one time-domain function. Thus, if you have \\\\( F(z)(\\omega) \\\\), you can uniquely determine \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
