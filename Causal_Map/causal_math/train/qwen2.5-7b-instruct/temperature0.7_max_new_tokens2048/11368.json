  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a stochastic differential equation \\\\(dx = (Ax + u)dt + BdW\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\) are constant matrices, \\\\(u\\\\) is a control input, and \\\\(dW\\\\) represents the increment of a Wiener process. We analyze how the output function \\\\( f(x) = Cx \\\\) behaves under different conditions, where \\\\(C\\\\) is a constant matrix outputting the observable state.\n\nAssuming we observe \\\\( f(x(T)) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we determine the path of the control input \\\\( u(x) \\\\) used if all other parameters (\\\\( A, B, C \\\\)) are known?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing the resultant state's output does not uniquely determine the control trajectory primarily due to the complicating effects of the stochastic processes involved. Different control paths \\\\( u(x) \\\\), combined with variations in \\\\( dW \\\\), could feasibly lead to equivalent observation outputs at time \\\\( T \\\\), obscuring the specific control actions taken.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The control input u directly influences the state x, which is also directly influenced by the matrices A and B. The state x determines the output f(x), and the output at time T, f(x(T)), depends on the path of the control input u."
