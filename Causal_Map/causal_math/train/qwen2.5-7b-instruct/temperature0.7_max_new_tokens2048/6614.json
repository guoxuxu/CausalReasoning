  "Problem": "Consider a two-variable system described by the equations \\\\(x' = x + 2y\\\\) and \\\\(y' = -2x + y\\\\). We explore the system's behavior under linear transformations and their combinations, denoted by matrix \\\\(M(t) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\cos(t) & -\\\\sin(t) \\\\\\\\ \\\\sin(t) & \\\\cos(t) \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\), which rotates the state vector \\\\((x, y)\\\\).\n\nCan we determine the initial vector \\\\((x_0, y_0)\\\\) after observing the vector at time \\\\(T\\\\), without knowing if the transformation \\\\(M(t)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing the end state at \\\\(t = T\\\\) without information on the application of \\\\(M(t)\\\\) does not allow for an accurate reconstruction of the initial state. Since the transformation could significantly alter the state's orientation and position, the lack of knowledge about its application means the initial state remains indeterminate.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
