  "Problem": "Consider the system modelled by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\Delta u\\\\), where \\\\(D\\\\) is a diffusion constant and \\\\(\\\\Delta\\\\) is the Laplacian operator. This equation is initially transformed by \\\\( v(x, t_0) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty u(x, t_0) e^{ikx} dx \\\\), which represents the Fourier transform at time \\\\(t_0\\\\).\n\nKnowing the Fourier transform \\\\( v(x, t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t \\\\), can we determine exactly what transformations or interventions were applied, assuming the initial condition was known?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple different transformations or combinations of interventions could result in the same observed \\\\( v(x, t) \\\\) due to the superposition and diffusive properties of the PDE. The effects of the transformations in Fourier space can overlap, making it impossible to discern distinct interventions solely based on the endpoint.",
