  "Problem": "Suppose we have a complex function \\\\( z = g(w) = e^{i\\\\omega t}w \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. This function is used to modify the initial conditions of a particle's state in a quantum system described by \\\\( \\psi(t) = U(t)\\psi_0 \\\\), where \\\\( U(t) \\\\) is a unitary time evolution operator.\n\nIf a new function \\\\( h(w) = e^{i\\theta}w \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( \\psi(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the original operator \\\\( U(t) \\\\) and not on the influences of \\\\( \\omega \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(w) = e^{i\\theta}w \\\\) adds an additional phase shift, influencing the trajectory and final observable state at time T. Thus, the endpoint \\\\( \\psi(T) \\\\) is dependent not only on the dynamics induced by \\\\( U(t) \\\\) but also significantly altered by the phase manipulations from both \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the function h(w) influences ψ(T), while the unitary operator U(t) determines ψ(T); thus, ψ(T) depends on h(w) and U(t), but not directly on ω or θ."
