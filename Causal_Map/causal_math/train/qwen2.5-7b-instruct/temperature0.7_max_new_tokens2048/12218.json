  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\) where C is a constant matrix. We examine the implications of a functional transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) applied at time t, where D is another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), and a follow-up intervention \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ft}z \\\\) (where F is a constant matrix) is applied later, does the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend exclusively on C?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at different times adds complexity to the system's evolution, making \\\\( z(T) \\\\) a function of C, D, and F. The transformations introduced by D and F before and after \\\\( t_1 \\\\) affect the trajectory such that the final state reflects the interplay between these matrices and C.",
