  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical setting where the Laplace transform, defined as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)dt\\\\), is used to solve differential equations. We consider the scenario where we apply this transformation to the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + p\\\\frac{dy}{dt} + qy = 0\\\\) under different initial conditions and interventions.\n\nGiven the transformed function in the Laplace domain, can we uniquely determine the initial conditions \\\\(y(0)\\\\) and \\\\(y'(0)\\\\) without knowing p and q?",
  "Explanation": "In the absence of the knowledge of parameters p and q, the transformed function in the Laplace domain does not uniquely specify the initial conditions because multiple differential equations (with different p and q values) can result in function forms that match in the Laplace domain, thus not allowing a unique determination of \\\\(y(0)\\\\) and \\\\(y'(0)\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
