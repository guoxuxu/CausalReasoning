  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\(z = x^T C x + bx\\\\), where x is a vector, C is a symmetric matrix, and b is another vector. We are examining the effect of the transformation \\\\(h(x) = Dx\\\\), where D is a regular matrix, on the output z.\n\nGiven the observed value of z, can we determine the initial vector \\\\(x_0\\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(h(x)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(h(x)\\\\) was applied, it is problematic to uniquely backtrack to \\\\(x_0\\\\) because both x and Dx could potentially yield the same z, owing to the ambiguity introduced by the linear and quadratic transformations involving C and b.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
