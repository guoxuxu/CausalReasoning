  "Problem": "Suppose we are examining a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s)\\\\), where \\\\(F(s)\\\\) potentially depends on parameter \\\\(a\\\\). We evaluate the system's behavior changes under the modification of \\\\(f(t)\\\\) by a function \\\\(g(t) = e^{at}f(t)\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\(g(t)\\\\) is applied to modify \\\\(f(t)\\\\) at t = 0 and the system is left to evolve through its natural transform without further intervention, will the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{g(t)\\\\}\\\\) be equivalent to \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}\\\\) shifted by \\\\(-a\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\(g(t) = e^{at}f(t)\\\\) is indeed \\\\(F(s-a)\\\\), indicating a horizontal shift in the s-plane by \\\\(-a\\\\). This is a fundamental property of the Laplace transform, showing that multiplying by an exponential results in a shift in the transform domain.",
