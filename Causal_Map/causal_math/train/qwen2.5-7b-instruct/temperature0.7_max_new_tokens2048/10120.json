  "Problem": "Investigate a unitary transformation system defined by \\\\(z(t+1) = Uz(t)\\\\) where \\\\(U\\\\) is a unitary matrix and \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is a complex vector. Consider the impact of the transformation \\\\(g(z) = Vz\\\\), where \\\\(V\\\\) is another unitary matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\(g(z)\\\\), \\\\(h(z)\\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) might result from various combinations of interventions due to the unitary nature of the matrices involved and their potential to preserve certain vector qualities while altering others. This results in a non-unique solution for recovering the sequences and types of interventions used, as multiple valid pathways could lead to the same endpoint through different intermediate transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state z(0) directly influences z(t) through the transformation Uz(t) → z(t+1), and the value of z(t) directly determines z(T). The transformation g(z) = Vz represents a separate intervention that may also affect z(t) but cannot be uniquely determined from z(T) alone without additional information."
