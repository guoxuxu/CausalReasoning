  "Problem": "Examine a feedback loop in an electrical circuit, modeled by a linear time-invariant system with transfer function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{sP + Q} \\\\), where P and Q are constant matrices. Let us consider an alteration involving the introduction of a feedback matrix K, changing the system to \\\\( \\\\tilde{H}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{sP + Q + K} \\\\).\n\nGiven the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\), can it be deduced whether the feedback matrix \\\\( K \\\\) was introduced at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), assuming no other information about the system is available?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional information on the specific nature of K and its relationship to P and Q, as well as lacking other system identification data, the output at T alone does not uniquely determine whether K was introduced or not. The system may inherently possess similar dynamics with different configurations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The introduction of feedback matrix K changes the transfer function H(s), which in turn affects the output y(t) at time T."
