  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\( h(x) \\\\) defined on real numbers, and its Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(h)(\\\\omega) \\\\). Analyze the scenario where modification is performed by another function \\\\( p(x) = e^{-ax^2} \\\\) where \\\\( a > 0 \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( r(x) = e^{-bx^2} \\\\) (where \\\\( b \\\\) is a constant different from \\\\( a \\\\)) is applied as an intervention to \\\\( q(x) \\\\), will the new Fourier transform at any time \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) depend only on the Fourier transforms of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) or include influences from both \\\\( p(x) \\\\) and \\\\( r(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( r(x) \\\\) adds another Gaussian modification, resulting in a function \\\\( s(x) = r(x)q(x) = e^{-bx^2}e^{-ax^2}h(x) \\\\). The convolution principles apply, affecting the Fourier transform of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) with both modifications \\\\( p(x) \\\\) and \\\\( r(x) \\\\). Hence, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(s)(\\\\omega) \\\\) includes influences of both transforming functions.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The Fourier transform of q(x) at any time t > t1 depends on the Fourier transforms of both p(x) and r(x), which in turn depend on their respective functions in the spatial domain. Therefore, the Fourier transform of h(x) at any time t > t1 includes influences from both p(x) and r(x)."
