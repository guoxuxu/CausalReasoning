  "Problem": "Examine the relationship in a mechanical system governed by the Laplace-transformed equation \\\\(L{\\\\ddot{x} + k\\\\dot{x} + mx} = F(s)\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\), and \\\\(m\\\\) are constants, and \\\\(F(s)\\\\) is the Laplace transform of a force function. We investigate the effects of applying different inverse transformations representing procedural changes.\n\nIf after a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) an intrinsic system modification is made, altering the constants to \\\\(k'\\\\) and \\\\(m'\\\\), will the displacement \\\\( x(t) \\\\) for \\\\(t > t_1\\\\) be independent of the transformations in \\\\( k \\\\) and \\\\( m \\\\) before \\\\( t_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The system modification changes the differential equation parameters, affecting the system's response to the same input function. Hence, the displacement \\\\(x(t)\\\\) for \\\\(t > t_1\\\\) remains dependent on both the prior and post-intervention parameters (\\\\(k, m\\\\) and  \\\\(k', m'\\\\)), influencing system dynamics overall.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace transform of the force function F(s) directly influences the displacement x(t). The constants k and m directly cause changes in the displacement x(t) before time t1. After time t1, changes in k and m do not affect x(t) if no further modifications are made."
