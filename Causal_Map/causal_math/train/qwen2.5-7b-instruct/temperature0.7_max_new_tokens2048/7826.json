  "Problem": "Analyze a heat equation \\\\(u_t = k u_{xx}\\\\) where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant, representing heat transfer in a one-dimensional rod. The function \\\\(g(u) = u + h(x)\\\\) is applied, where \\\\(h(x)\\\\) is a spatial heat source distribution that varies with position \\\\(x\\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original temperature distribution \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\(g(u)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\(g(u)\\\\), it is not feasible to distinguish if the observed state \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) resulted directly from \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) or from \\\\(u_0(x) + h(x)\\\\). The additional heat source \\\\(h(x)\\\\) modifies the evolution in a way that is irreversible and non-unique without prior information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The temperature distribution u changes over time due to thermal diffusivity k and spatial heat source h. Applying g(u) modifies u. Observing u at time T allows inference of the original temperature distribution u_0(x) at t=0 if g(u) is known or can be reversed."
