  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = re^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( r \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are constants, representing a circular trajectory in the complex plane. Analyze the impact of a transformation implemented by the function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) at time t and its effects on the system.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( r \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), and not on \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\) introduces a phase shift \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\), which modifies the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alongside the original parameters \\\\( r \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). This phase change, combined with the original path, alters the outcome compared to without the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The endpoint z(T) depends on r, ω, and θ through the transformations f(z) and g(z). Specifically, applying g(z) introduces θ into the system, which affects the endpoint z(T) for T > t1."
