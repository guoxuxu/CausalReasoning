  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}w \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex constant vector. We analyze the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to this function over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) at a particular frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), can we infer precisely whether the modulation \\\\( e^{iCt} \\\\) was applied, by examining \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform may exhibit characteristics such as peaks or shifts that correspond to multiple possible modulations or a combination of them. Without additional information about the phase or timing of the modulations, it can be challenging to deduce exactly which modulations were applied, including whether \\\\( e^{iCt} \\\\) was part of the intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of w directly influences z(t); the passage of time t directly influences z(t); the constant C directly influences the modulation e^(iCt); the modulation e^(iCt) directly influences z(t); the Fourier transform Z(ω) indirectly influences z(t) through its inverse transformation."
