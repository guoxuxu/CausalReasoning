  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{u}(x, t) \\\\) described by the Navier-Stokes equations with a divergence-free condition. Study the effect of introducing a scalar field \\\\( \\\\theta(x, t) = T(x)e^{\\lambda t} \\\\), where T(x) represents a temperature distribution and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a growth rate, on heat transfer characteristics of the flow.\n\nIf a control is applied at time t1 to modulate the flow using a vector field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v}(x, t) = -k\\\\mathbf{u}(x, t) \\\\), where k is a constant, will the temperature distribution at T, for T > t1, solely rely on the initial profiles and \\\\( lambda \\\\) without being affected by \\\\( k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v}(x, t) \\\\) modifies the flow dynamics significantly, affecting how the temperature is transported and diffused throughout the domain. This intervention means the final temperature profile depends not only on the initial state and \\\\( lambda \\\\) but also on the intervention factor \\\\( k \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
