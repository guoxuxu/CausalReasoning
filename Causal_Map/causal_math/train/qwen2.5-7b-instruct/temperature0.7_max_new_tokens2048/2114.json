  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a vector differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\) where D is a diagonalizable matrix. The transformation \\\\( g(z) = K^{-1}e^{Lt}Kz \\\\), where K is a matrix diagonalizing D (i.e., \\\\(D = K L K^{-1}\\\\)), and L is a diagonal matrix, is applied to observe its behavior under system evolution.\n\nUpon observing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we deduce the initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at time t = 0 before \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was potentially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given the known properties of D and its association with L through K, it is possible to reverse the transformation and the natural evolution of the system to compute back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\), assuming \\\\( z(T) = K^{-1}e^{LT}K z_0 \\\\), implying \\\\( z_0 = K e^{-LT} K^{-1} z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The eigenvalues L determine the dynamics of D, which in turn influences the state z(T). The initial state z_0 evolves over time to become z(T). Applying the transformation g(z) using K does not change the causal relationship between z_0 and z(T)."
