  "Problem": "Consider a controlled dynamical system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + L(u) = 0\\\\), where L is a linear operator. An intervention is applied via a transformation \\\\(g(u) = u + h(t)\\\\), with h(t) representing a controlled input function.\n\nIf \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) is set as an initial condition and evolves according to \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + L(u) = 0\\\\) without any addition of \\\\(h(t)\\\\), will the solution \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\(g(u)\\\\) had been applied at some time \\\\(t_0 < T\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without the intervention of \\\\(h(t)\\\\), the evolution of \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) solely depends on the initial conditions and the operator L. The additional function \\\\(h(t)\\\\) would alter the trajectory of the solution, resulting in a different state at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u(x,0) directly influences the solution u(x,t) which then determines u(x,T). The transformation g(u) depends on u(x,t) and h(t), and applying g(u) at t_0 modifies the solution path from u(x,t) to u(x,T)."
