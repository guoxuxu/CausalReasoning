  "Problem": "Contemplate a scenario where a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves as per the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant complex number. We examine the scenario under a transformation \\\\( T(z) = z e^{i\\\\theta t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is another constant frequency.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were applied (whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( U(z) \\\\), or both), solely by the state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The cumulative effects of phase shifts from \\\\( T(z) \\\\) and \\\\( U(z) \\\\) combined with the base evolution complicate distinguishing the precise sequence or types of interventions used. The overlap in potential trajectories and interactions between the introduced phase variables at different points make it impossible to identify interventions uniquely.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation T(z) and the constant k each contribute to the rate of change of z with respect to time, while T(z) also depends on the frequency θ."
