  "Problem": "Consider the effect of a complex function \\\\( w(z) = e^{kz} \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant, on a field defined by \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\) over the complex plane. The function transforms the complex variable \\\\( z = x + iy \\\\) over time, under linear transformation \\\\( T(v) = Av \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\) at time T, can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( w(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the complex and potentially overlapping effects of the exponential transformations introduced by \\\\( w(z) = e^{kz} \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) = e^{mz} \\\\), it is impossible to uniquely identify which interventions were applied based solely on the endpoint \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\). The transformations could yield similar or indistinguishable results under certain conditions, making attribution solely based on the final state infeasible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
