  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\( T \\) represented by a constant matrix applied to vector space \\( V \\). This operator is part of the integral transformation \\( y(x) = \\int_{a}^{b} T f(\\xi) K(x,\\xi) \\, d\\xi \\), where \\( K(x,\\xi) \\) is the kernel function for the transformation.\n\nIf the kernel function \\( K(x, \\xi) \\) is modified from \\( K \\) to \\( K' \\) without changing the operator \\( T \\) or function \\( f \\), will the output \\( y(x) \\) remain unchanged?",
  "Explanation": "The kernel function heavily influences the integration operation in \\( y(x) \\). Changing \\( K \\) to \\( K' \\) alters the way \\( f(\\xi) \\) is mapped and integrated over the interval [a, b], thereby changing the output \\( y(x) \\), even though \\( T \\) remains constant.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
