  "Problem": "Assume a process where a complex function \\\\( z = x + iy \\\\) undergoes a transformation under a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\), which acts as \\\\( L(z) = Az + B \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constants in the complex plane. Consider the effect of an additional transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) at time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nGiven only the status of the system at time \\\\( T \\\\) following transformations by \\\\( L \\\\) and multiple interventions, is it possible to pinpoint the precise transformations used (whether \\\\( L \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or \\\\( m(z) \\\\)) based solely on the final result?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact transformations used based only on the final state at time \\\\( T \\\\) is impractical without additional information. The nature of complex function evolution, especially with multiple non-commutative transformations applied, makes it difficult to conclusively dissect the specific impact and sequence of each application due to possible overlapping and intermixing effects.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The linear operator L transforms z to z', the exponential transformation h changes z' to z'', and the passage of time T from an initial state to the final state involves the application of h."
