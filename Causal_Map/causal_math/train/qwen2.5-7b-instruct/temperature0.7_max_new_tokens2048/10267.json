  "Problem": "Analyze the vector field transformation under a nonlinear map \\\\(G(z) = z^2 + c\\\\), where \\\\(z\\\\) and \\\\(c\\\\) are complex numbers, and the implementation of the Laplace transform on the time trajectories of a function \\\\( h(t) = Re(G(e^{i\\\\omega t})) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency.\n\nIf an intervention is made at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) applying a function \\\\( J(z) = z + d \\\\) (where \\\\( d \\\\) is another complex number) to the trajectory of \\\\( h(t) \\\\), will the Laplace transform of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) (\\\\( T > t_1 \\\\)) remain solely influenced by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\), disregarding \\\\( d \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention alters \\\\( h(t) \\\\) by shifting the trajectory influenced by \\\\( d \\\\). This intervention modifies the system such that the resultant Laplace transform at \\\\( T \\\\), covers effects originating from \\\\( d \\\\) as well as \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), hence it is not solely dependent on the initial values but also on the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of h(t) is influenced by G(z), c, and ω. Intervening with J(z) affects h(t), but after time t1, the Laplace transform of h(t) at T (T > t1) remains primarily influenced by ω and c, with the effect of d diminishing over time."
