  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution in a material is modeled by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k \\\\Delta u \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal conductivity and \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) is the Laplacian operator. We investigate the effect of an external heat source, which is modeled as \\\\( h(x, t) \\\\), added to specific points in the material at time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf a new heat source \\\\( j(x, t) \\\\) is introduced at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention, will the temperature distribution at time \\\\( T \\\\) (where \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\)) depend only on \\\\( k \\\\) and the original heat source \\\\( h(x, t) \\\\), and not on the new source \\\\( j(x, t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the new heat source \\\\( j(x, t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces additional dynamics in the system. This means that the temperature distribution at any later time, including \\\\( T \\\\), will be influenced by this new source in addition to the original heat equation parameters and any previous sources.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
