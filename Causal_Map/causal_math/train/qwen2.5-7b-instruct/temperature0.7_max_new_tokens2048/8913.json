  "Problem": "Consider an electrical RC (Resistor-Capacitor) circuit where the voltage across the capacitor is described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dV}{dt} = -\\\\frac{1}{RC}V + \\\\frac{1}{R}I(t)\\\\), with R being the resistance, C the capacitance, and I(t) a time-varying input current. We analyze the behavior of this system under the function \\\\( g(V) = V + e^{At}\\\\), where A is a constant.\n\nIf the function \\\\( g(V) \\\\) is used to modify the initial voltage \\\\( V_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and the system is then left to evolve under the given differential equation, will the voltage \\\\( V(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( V_0 \\\\) was directly subjected to the differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( g(V) \\\\) modifies the initial state by adding \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) to the voltage, which influences the differential equation's evolution. The initial bump in voltage alters the trajectory, causing a different voltage at any subsequent time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "V_0 → V(t); I(t) → dV/dt; R → dV/dt; C → dV/dt",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial voltage V_0, resistance R, capacitance C, and time-varying input current I(t) directly influence the rate of change of voltage dV/dt. Applying the function g(V) modifies V_0 but does not alter the fundamental relationship between the variables in the differential equation."
