  "Problem": "Analyze the causal dynamics of a particle moving in a potential field given by \\( V(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 \\), where \\( k \\) is a positive constant. The motion is subject to an external force \\( F(t) \\), and the differential equation governing the motion is \\( m\\ddot{x} = -\\frac{dV}{dx} + F(t) \\), where \\( m \\) is the mass of the particle.\n\nIf the external force \\( F(t) \\) is applied continuously from \\( t = 0 \\) to \\( t = T \\), will the position \\( x(T) \\) of the particle solely depend on the initial conditions and the nature of \\( F(t) \\) without the influence of \\( k \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The position \\( x(T) \\) is influenced by \\( k \\) through the potential field, as well as by the initial conditions and the external force \\( F(t) \\). The nature of \\( k \\) affects the restoring force \\( -kx \\) which interacts with \\( F(t) \\) in determining the motion of the particle.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The position at time T, x(T), depends on the initial position x(0), initial velocity v(0), and the external force F(t) over time."
