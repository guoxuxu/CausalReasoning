  "Problem": "We consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) where A is a constant matrix. The system is subjected to an integral transform defined by \\\\( g(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{B\\\\tau}x(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where B is also a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) obtained at time T, can it be unequivocally traced back to the original state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 before \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied, without knowing whether the transformation was utilized?",
  "Explanation": "Without confirmation whether \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied, there is ambiguity in the initial condition due to the convolution with \\\\( e^{B\\\\tau} \\\\). Since the transformation can modify \\\\( x_0 \\\\) in various ways dependent on B, decoding \\\\( x_0 \\\\) purely from \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is not retrievable.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
