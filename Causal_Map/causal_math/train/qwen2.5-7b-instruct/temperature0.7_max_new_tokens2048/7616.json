  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow in a channel described by the complex potential function \\\\( w(z) = Uz + \\\\frac{\\\\kappa}{2\\\\pi i} \\\\ln(z) \\\\), which represents a combination of uniform flow and a source at the origin. Here, \\\\( U \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( z \\\\) is the complex position variable.\n\nBy observing the flow pattern changes near the origin, can we infer the exact location and strength of the sink introduced at \\\\( z = a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The effect of the sink on the flow near the origin is nontrivial and depends on the relative position \\\\( a \\\\) and the strength \\\\( \\\\kappa' \\\\). Multiple configurations of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\kappa' \\\\) might result in similar alterations in the flow near the origin, making it impossible to unambiguously determine the sink's parameters just from local observations without further information on the flow dynamics.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The complex potential function w(z) influences the flow pattern, while the introduction of a sink at z=a changes the sink_location. The constant κ determines the source_strength, and U represents the uniform_flow_speed."
