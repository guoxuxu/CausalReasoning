  "Problem": "Consider a stochastic differential equation modeled by \\\\(dX_t = \\mu(X_t, t) dt + \\sigma(X_t, t) dW_t\\\\), where \\\\(\\mu\\\\) and \\\\(\\sigma\\\\) are functions of the state \\\\(X_t\\\\) and time t, and \\\\(W_t\\\\) represents a standard Brownian motion. We explore the effect of modifying the initial state by a deterministic transformation given by \\\\(h(X) = X + k\\\\), where k is a fixed constant.\n\nIf \\\\(h(X)\\\\) is applied to an initial state \\\\(X_0\\\\) and then allowed to evolve according to the stochastic differential equation without further intervention, will the state \\\\(X(t)\\\\) at time t be identical to if \\\\(X_0\\\\) was directly evolved to time t?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(h(X)\\\\) modifies the initial state, \\\\(X_0\\\\), by adding a constant k, which shifts the entire path of the process. Since the drift \\\\(\\mu\\\\) and the diffusion \\\\(\\sigma\\\\) coefficients might depend on the state, the shift in initial conditions changes the trajectory of \\\\(X_t\\\\), leading to a different state at time t.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state X_0 directly influences the state X(t) at time t; applying the transformation h(X_0) = X_0 + k to X_0 before evolving it according to the SDE does not result in the same state X(t) as directly evolving X_0, due to the added constant k."
