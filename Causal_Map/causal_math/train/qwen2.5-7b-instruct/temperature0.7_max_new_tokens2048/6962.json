  "Problem": "Consider a complex function of a real variable, \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We explore the effects of applying a Fourier Transform to this signal, represented as \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed signal \\\\( F(s) \\\\) at frequency \\\\( s = \\\\omega \\\\), can we infer that it was specifically \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) that generated this \\\\( F(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform of \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) results in a Dirac delta function centered at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Hence, if \\\\( F(s) \\\\) shows a delta function at \\\\( s = \\\\omega \\\\) and nowhere else, it implies the original function was indeed \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\).",
