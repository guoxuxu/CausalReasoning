  "Problem": "Consider the analytical solution of the heat equation \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\) under initial conditions that can be represented as a Fourier transform. An operation \\\\( f(u) = u + e^{i\\\\omega_0 x} \\\\) is introduced, where \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nIf \\\\( f(u) \\\\) is applied to an initial temperature distribution \\\\( u_0 \\\\) and then the system is allowed to evolve according to the heat equation without further intervention, will the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) at a later time t match that obtained from evolving \\\\( u_0 \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(u) \\\\) modifies the initial conditions of the system by adding a sinusoidal component. Given the linearity of the heat equation, this additional term evolves independently under the heat equation, resulting in a different temperature distribution at any later time due to the influence of the term \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega_0 x} \\\\) propagating and diffusing over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the operation f(u) to the initial temperature distribution u_0 and then evolving according to the heat equation leads to a temperature distribution u(x,t) that differs from evolving u_0 alone due to the added term e^(iω_0 x)."
