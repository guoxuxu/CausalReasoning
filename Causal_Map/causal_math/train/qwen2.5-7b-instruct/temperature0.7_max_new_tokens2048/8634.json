  "Problem": "Analyze a Fourier transform scenario where a given function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) on the domain \\\\( t \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\) undergoes the transformation defined by \\\\( F(\\xi) = \\\\mathcal{F}(f(t))(\\\\xi) \\\\), which is the Fourier transform of \\\\( f(t) \\\\). The variable \\\\( \\\\xi \\\\) denotes frequency. The effect of a multiplicative modulation by a cosine wave, \\\\( h(t) = \\\\cos(\\\\omega_0 t) \\\\), on \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is considered, i.e., the new function becomes \\\\( g(t) = f(t) \\\\cos(\\\\omega_0 t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( G(\\\\xi) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( h(t) \\\\) was applied, can we confirm whether the original signal was just \\\\( f(t) \\\\) in the absence of additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of frequency components at \\\\( \\\\xi \\\\pm \\\\omega_0 \\\\) suggests the application of \\\\( h(t) = \\\\cos(\\\\omega_0 t) \\\\), but without explicit details, \\\\( G(\\\\xi) \\\\) alone cannot confirm the presence of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) due to potential ambiguity with other transformations or signals.",
