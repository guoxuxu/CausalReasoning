  "Problem": "Analyze the role of the Laplace transform in a control system governed by the linear partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( u_t + Au = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a linear operator. We consider the application of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t)\\\\} = U(s) \\\\) and explore the repercussions on the system's response over time.\n\nCan the original function \\\\( u_0 \\\\) be uniquely determined from the Laplace transform \\\\( U(s) \\\\) at a later time without other interventions or additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform provides a frequency-domain representation of the system which might not uniquely determine \\\\( u_0 \\\\) due to potential issues with non-injectivity and the presence of similar systems leading to the same transform output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The original function u_0 can be indirectly determined through its Laplace transform U(s) and the inverse Laplace transform, which recovers u(t) over time."
