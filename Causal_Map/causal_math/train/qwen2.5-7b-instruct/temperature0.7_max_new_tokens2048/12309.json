  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\) evolved under the differential system \\( \\dot{z} = z^2 + c \\) where \\( c \\) is a non-zero complex constant. Investigations include the effect of executing a transformation given by the integral transform \\( \\mathcal{F}(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt \\), with \\( s \\) being a complex parameter.\n\nFrom observing \\( z(T) \\) at some time T, can one deduce exactly what the transformed function \\( \\mathcal{F}(z) \\) at t=0 was, assuming no intervention other than the complex differential system \\( \\dot{z} = z^2 + c \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The complex dynamics governed by \\( z^2 + c \\) significantly modulate \\( z \\)'s trajectory, making it non-trivial to reverse-engineer or accurately determine the original function \\( \\mathcal{F}(z) \\) solely based on final observations at \\( z(T) \\) without explicit knowledge of all intermediate transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
