  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x) = x^2 \\\\) defined over the complex numbers, and let \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^z e^{w^2} dw \\\\) be an integral transformation. Investigate the implications of this setup where \\\\( z \\\\) evolves as a complex function.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z \\\\) is initially set to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and later modified to \\\\( z_1 = z_0 + h \\\\) (where \\\\( h \\\\) is a non-zero real number) as an intervention, will the resulting \\\\( g(z_1) \\\\) be independent of the original function form \\\\( f(x) = x^2 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies \\\\( z \\\\) to \\\\( z_1 \\\\), but since \\\\( g(z) \\\\) computes an exponential integral that deeply depends on the squared value from \\\\( f(x) \\\\), \\\\( g(z_1) \\\\) will not be independent of the original squaring function. The transformed input still relies on the output of \\\\( f(x) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "A change in h directly causes a change in z_1, and z_1 directly causes a change in g(z_1). The original function form f(x) = x^2 does not directly cause changes in g(z_1) through this causal chain."
