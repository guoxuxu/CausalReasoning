  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\) where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( n \\\\) is an integer. We explore the effect of two linear transformations \\\\( T_1(z) = az \\\\) and \\\\( T_2(z) = bz \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are non-zero complex constants, on the mapping described by \\\\( f \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( T_1 \\\\) is initially applied and later, at some arbitrary point, \\\\( T_2 \\\\) is also applied before applying \\\\( f \\\\), does the final result depend solely on the initial value and \\\\( n \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying both transformations changes the initial conditions by a factor of \\\\( ab \\\\) before \\\\( f \\\\) is applied. The final output \\\\( f(T_2(T_1(z_0))) = (abz_0)^n \\\\) depends on both \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), not just \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and \\\\( n \\\\), due to the compounding effects of the transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
