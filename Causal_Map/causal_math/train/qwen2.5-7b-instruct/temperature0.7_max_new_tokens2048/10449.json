  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) = x^2 + iy^2 \\\\) where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are real variables and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze how the complex integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int e^{zt} dz \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) is a real parameter, affects the output.\n\nApplying the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) to \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\) immediately and letting \\\\( t \\\\) evolve, does the result differ from directly applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) on \\\\( z = x^2 + iy^2 \\\\) at a later time \\\\( t = T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The value of \\\\( t \\\\) influences the exponential term \\\\( e^{zt} \\\\) within the integral drastically due to the complex exponentiation, which magnifies the effects of the nonlinearity in \\\\( z = x^2 + iy^2 \\\\). The impact of \\\\( t \\\\) at different times introduces variation in the integral's evaluation, leading to different results.",
