  "Problem": "Consider a linear algebra problem involving an initial matrix \\u0027X\\u0027. The function \\u0027f(X) = e^{At}X\\u0027 transforms \\u0027X\\u0027 over time \\u0027t\\u0027, where \\u0027A\\u0027 is a constant skew-symmetric matrix. This explores changes under the integral transformation using the Laplace Transform of \\u0027X\\u0027.\n\nIf, at a specific time \\u0027t_1\\u0027, the matrix is further acted upon by a function \\u0027g(X) = e^{Bt}X\\u0027 (where \\u0027B\\u0027 is another constant matrix), will the eigenvalues of \\u0027X(T)\\u0027 for \\u0027T > t_1\\u0027 depend exclusively on \\u0027A\\u0027 and not on \\u0027B\\u0027?",
  "Explanation": "The subsequent transformation by \\u0027g(X)\\u0027 introduces changes dependent on the matrix \\u0027B\\u0027. This affects the eigenvalues of \\u0027X(T)\\u0027 due to the potential non-commutative nature of \\u0027e^{At}\\u0027 and \\u0027e^{Bt}\\u0027, making the final eigenvalues dependent on both \\u0027A\\u0027 and \\u0027B\\u0027.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of matrix X from time t_1 to T is primarily influenced by matrix A through the transformation e^(At), with secondary transformation e^(Bt) also acting on X but not changing the eigenvalues of X(T) for T > t_1."
