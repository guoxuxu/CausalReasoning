  "Problem": "We consider a linear system transformed by applying a Fourier Transform to its input signal \\(x(t)\\), resulting in \\(X(ω) = ℱ\\{x(t)\\}\\). Let the system be characterized by the differential equation \\(\\\\dot{y} = Ky\\), where \\(K\\) is a constant matrix, and the output given by \\(y(t)\\) is also transformed, \\(Y(ω) = ℱ\\{y(t)\\}\\).\n\nGiven the transformed output \\(Y(ω)\\), can we uniquely determine \\(X(ω)\\) at \\(\\omega\\) if we know \\(K\\) but no other interventions are made?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing \\(K\\) allows us to solve the inverse problem, provided that the system described by \\(K\\) is invertible. If the matrix \\(K\\) sufficiently characterizes the transformation in the frequency domain, then \\(X(ω)\\) can be uniquely determined from \\(Y(ω)\\) by applying the inverse of the Fourier Transform modified by \\(K^{-1}\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
