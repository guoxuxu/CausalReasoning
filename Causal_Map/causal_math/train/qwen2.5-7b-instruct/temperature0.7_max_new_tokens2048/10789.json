  "Problem": "Consider a hypothetical physical system where the state of the system \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\), with D being a constant matrix. We analyze the influence of changing the basis of the state vector using the transformation \\\\( T(x) = Px \\\\), where P is a matrix representing a change of basis.\n\nIf \\\\( T(x) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be the basis transformed form of \\\\( x_0 \\\\) directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(x) = Px \\\\) alters the initial state to \\\\( Px_0 \\\\). Although both systems are governed by the same differential equation, due to the change of basis before the evolution, the resulting state vectors will not only differ by a transformation but will follow different trajectories unless P commutes with D.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation T(x) to x(0) results in a new state vector that evolves under the dynamics described by D to produce x(t) at time t."
