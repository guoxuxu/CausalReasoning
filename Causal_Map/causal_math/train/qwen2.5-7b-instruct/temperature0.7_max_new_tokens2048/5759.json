  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are scalar constants. The transformation applied is \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant scalar.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention with a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is a constant scalar) is introduced, does the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend only on A and B, without influence from C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) provides an additional transformation distinct from \\\\( f(z) \\\\)'. Both C and D can affect the evolution paths of x and y due to their exponential scaling effects, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on A, B, C, and D.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
