  "Problem": "Consider a complex function of a real variable, \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We explore the effects of applying a Fourier Transform to this signal, represented as \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is Fourier transformed to \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and allowed to process without any further intervention, will the inverse Fourier Transform at any future time \\\\( t \\\\) give us back the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform is linear and invertible under appropriate conditions. Therefore, assuming no losses or alterations in the transformation process, applying the inverse Fourier Transform to \\\\( F(s) \\\\) will indeed recover the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) exactly.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
