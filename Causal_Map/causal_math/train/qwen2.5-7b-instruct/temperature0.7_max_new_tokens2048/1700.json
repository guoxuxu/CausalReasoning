  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature T in a region evolves according to the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta T \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. Suppose a transformation \\\\( f(T) = T + \\\\alpha \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\) is applied to the initial temperature distribution, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are constants.\n\nGiven the temperature distribution \\\\( T(T) \\\\), can we determine exactly what interventions were used (whether \\\\( f(T) \\\\), \\\\( g(T) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( T(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The superposition and diffusion of effects from both the initial transformation and the intervention, along with native thermal diffusion, create complex interactions that obscure their individual impacts. It is therefore impossible to pinpoint precisely the types or parameters of interventions based solely on the final temperature distribution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
