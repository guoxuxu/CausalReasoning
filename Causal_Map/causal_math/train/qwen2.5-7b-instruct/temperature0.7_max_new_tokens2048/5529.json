  "Problem": "A complex function is defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We analyze the effects of a linear transformation \\\\( L(z) = cz + d \\\\) over time t, where c and d are complex constants.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( L(z) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and allowed to evolve naturally, will \\\\( L(z(t)) \\\\) at any time t > 0 be equivalent to the direct evaluation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under the original function without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( L(z) \\\\) modifies the initial output of the function by adding a constant and scaling it, changing the trajectory of the solution over time. The transformation changes both amplitude and phase components of the function, resulting in a wave pattern different from the untransformed case.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
