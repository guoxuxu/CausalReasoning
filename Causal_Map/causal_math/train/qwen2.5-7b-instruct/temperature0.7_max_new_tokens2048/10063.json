  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow governed by the Navier-Stokes equation, simplified to \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + (u \\\\cdot \\\\nabla)u = -\\\\nabla p + \\nu\\\\nabla^2u\\\\), where u is the velocity field, p is pressure, and ν is viscosity. Evaluate the behavior under a Fourier transform of the velocity field, represented as \\\\( F(u)(k) \\\\), where k is the wave number.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a filter function \\\\( G(u) = H(k-k_0)u \\\\) (where \\\\( H \\\\) is the Heaviside function and \\\\( k_0 \\\\) a specific wave number) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( F(u)(k, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on initial parameters and not on \\\\( k_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( G(u) \\\\) introduces a filtering based on wave number which modifies the spectrum of the velocity field. Thus, the final state \\\\( F(u)(k, T) \\\\) will depend on the initial conditions, the Navier-Stokes dynamics, and critically on the wave number \\\\( k_0 \\\\) due to the selective filtering of certain frequencies.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the filter function G(u) does not change the endpoint F(u)(k, T) for T > t_1, implying that F(u)(k, T) → F(u)(k, T) and G(u) → F(u)(k, T) are consistent with each other."
