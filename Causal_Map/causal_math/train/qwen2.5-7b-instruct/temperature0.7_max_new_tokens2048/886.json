  "Problem": "Consider a continuous linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(dx/dt = Mx\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We examine the effect of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(x) = S(t)x \\\\) over time t, where S(t) is a transformation that represents shuffling components of x based on another constant matrix S.\n\nCan we determine the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied, it's impossible to accurately trace back to \\\\( x_0 \\\\) because the initial transformation could have changed the orientation or the basis in which the systems dynamics established. Essential information about initial conditions could be obscured by the transformations applied at t = 0.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
