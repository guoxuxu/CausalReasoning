  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), representing a time-varying signal where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. We analyze the causal effects using the Laplace Transform defined by \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) = \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), which transforms this time function into the complex frequency domain.\n\nGiven the Laplace Transform of the signal, can we uniquely determine the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) of the signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The pole of the Laplace Transform directly relates to the frequency of the original signal. The pole's location at \\\\( s = i\\omega \\\\) unequivocally determines the angular frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) of the original signal.",
