  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation governed by the equation \\\\(z(t) = Ce^{Dt}x\\\\), where C and D are constant matrices and x is an initial vector. We study the implications of applying an additional transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Et}z \\\\) at some point in time t, where E is also a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we deduce the original vector \\\\( x \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was employed?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at the start could obscure the initial conditions unless specific knowledge about the matrix E, or a relationship between E and D that would simplify the reverse calculation, is known. Without such information, multiple possible initial vectors could lead to the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial vector x, the constant matrix C, the constant matrix D, and the constant matrix E each contribute to determining the state z(T) at time T through the transformations described."
