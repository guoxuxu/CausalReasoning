  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real functions of time and represent the real and imaginary parts of \\\\(z\\\\), respectively. The function is subjected to the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\), and the transformed function is \\\\(Z(s)\\\\). We also consider the effect of multiplying \\\\(z(t)\\\\) by a factor of \\\\(e^{at}\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) is a real constant, before transforming.\n\nIf the function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is transformed directly by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) without multiplication by \\\\(e^{at}\\\\), will the Laplace transform \\\\(Z(s)\\\\) show a shift in the complex plane compared to transforming after multiplying by \\\\(e^{at}\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The direct Laplace transform of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) without the factor \\\\(e^{at}\\\\) results in \\\\(Z(s)\\\\), while multiplying by \\\\(e^{at}\\\\) before transforming shifts the argument to \\\\(s-a\\\\). This results in the transform \\\\(Z(s-a)\\\\), which represents a shift in the complex plane compared to \\\\(Z(s)\\\\), reflecting changes in the convergence properties.",
