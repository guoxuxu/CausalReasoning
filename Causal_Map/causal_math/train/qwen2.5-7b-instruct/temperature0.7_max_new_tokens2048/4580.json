  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iωt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( ω \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state. We explore the impact of the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{αt}z \\\\) where \\\\( α \\\\) is a complex constant, applied at different points in the time evolution.\n\nProvided the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were applied (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both), by only knowing the state at \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) being the result of potentially multiple overlapping complex exponentials makes it difficult to discern exact interventions uniquely. The interplay of the magnitudes and phases affected by \\\\( α \\\\) and \\\\( β \\\\) could produce equivalently viable trajectories leading to the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\), obscuring the identification of specific interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The phase of the complex state at time T is influenced by ωt, while the magnitude is influenced by αt."
