  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. The function represents a signal in the complex plane, oscillating with time. We study the effect of applying a Fourier transform to this function to analyze its spectral properties.\n\nIf a phase shift transformation, defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t + \\phi} \\\\) where \\\\( \\phi \\\\) is a constant phase, is applied before computing the Fourier transform, will the spectrum still show a single frequency at \\\\( \\omega \\\\) without shifts?",
  "Explanation": "The phase shift \\\\( \\phi \\\\) in the time domain translates into a modified phase in the frequency domain without altering the location of the frequency component. Thus, the spectrum will still show a peak at \\\\( \\omega \\\\), confirming the frequency component remains unchanged, only the phase is affected.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying a phase shift to z(t) modifies z(t) but does not change the fundamental frequency content, so the spectrum still shows a single frequency at ω without shifts."
