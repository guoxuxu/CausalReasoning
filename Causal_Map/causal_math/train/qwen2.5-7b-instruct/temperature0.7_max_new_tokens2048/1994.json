  "Problem": "Investigate a system governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Sz \\\\), where S is a constant matrix. The study focuses on the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) implemented at various times t, with D being another constant matrix.\n\nCan the initial complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) be uniquely determined from the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) observed at T, without knowing if the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The potential transformation by \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) at the initial time obscures the original state unless additional information about the application of D is known. Different initial vectors transformed by distinct D matrices could evolve to the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
