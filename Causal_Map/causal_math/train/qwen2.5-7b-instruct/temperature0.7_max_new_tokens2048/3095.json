  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z : \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\) given by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number. We examine the impact of the Laplace Transform and its inverse on this function over time.\n\nIf a scaling function \\\\( f(t) = 2z(t) \\\\) is introduced at some time after computing \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\), and the Laplace Transform is then recalculated, will the new transform \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\) depend solely on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) without the intervention affecting the result?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with scaling affects the Laplace Transform significantly. The new transform, \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\), will represent the scaling, resulting in \\\\( Z'(s) = \\\\frac{2}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), which clearly shows the effect of the scaling intervention.",

List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
