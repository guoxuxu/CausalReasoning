  "Problem": "Consider a system driven by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. Explore the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\), transforming it into the frequency domain as \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) \\\\).\n\nCan we determine the initial function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) from the observed \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) without knowing the operator \\\\( L \\\\), just by inversely applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of L, it isn't definite how the transformation affected \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) over time; thus, reconstructing the exact initial conditions from \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) only by inverse Fourier without considering \\\\( L \\\\) is uncertain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "u(x, t) → u(x, 0); u(x, t) → hat{u}(k, t); hat{u}(k, t) → hat{u}(k, T); hat{u}(k, T) ← inverse(Fourier) → u(x, T)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial function u(x, 0) influences u(x, t) through the partial differential equation, which transforms to \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) \\\\) via the Fourier transform. Observing \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) allows for the reconstruction of u(x, T) using the inverse Fourier transform, but determining u(x, 0) without knowing L is not possible."
