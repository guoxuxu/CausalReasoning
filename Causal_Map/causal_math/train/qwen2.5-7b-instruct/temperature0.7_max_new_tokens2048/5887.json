  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the Poisson equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = f\\\\) in a domain \\\\(D\\\\), with \\\\(f\\\\) representing a source term. This domain undergoes a transformation \\\\(T\\\\) that maps it to a new domain \\\\(D'\\\\). The transformation changes how the system responds over time.\n\nIf an adaptive source term adjustment \\\\(f' = f + g\\\\) is introduced as an intervention after the domain is transformed to \\\\(D'\\\\), will the resulting Poisson equation solution in \\\\(D'\\\\) only depend on the new source term \\\\(f'+g\\\\) and not on the original configuration in \\\\(D\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the new source term \\\\(f'+g\\\\) plays a critical role, the domain's geometry transformed by \\\\(T\\\\) also significantly influences the solution. Any intervention in the form of additional source terms must still contend with how the altered spatial characteristics interact with these terms, thus not solely depending on the modified source alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation T maps the domain D to D', which affects how the source term f influences the solution u in the new domain D'. An adaptive source term adjustment f' = f + g, introduced after the transformation, directly causes the solution u in D'. The original configuration in D does not directly cause the solution u in D' once the transformation has occurred."
