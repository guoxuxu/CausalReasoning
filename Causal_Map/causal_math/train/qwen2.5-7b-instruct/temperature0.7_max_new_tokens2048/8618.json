  "Problem": "Consider a function z defined in the complex plane as \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. We are interested in how the Fourier Transform, denoted by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), affects this function.\n\nKnowing only the Fourier Transform at time T, can we determine the original function z(t) at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) directly gives the frequency component w. Since \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is solely defined by its frequency w in the exponential term, knowing the transform at any time point is sufficient to accurately deduce the original function at any earlier time, including t = 0.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
