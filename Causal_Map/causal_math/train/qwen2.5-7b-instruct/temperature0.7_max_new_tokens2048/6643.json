  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where A is a real constant matrix, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We inspect how the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\) affects the system's behavior over time t, where B is also a real constant matrix.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( k(z) = e^{iCt}z \\\\) (where C is another real constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( B \\\\) or \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of an additional transformation \\\\( k(z) \\\\) introduces further modifications based on the matrix \\\\( C \\\\). Both \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\), having influenced the state at different segments of its trajectory, contribute to the final state at \\\\( T \\\\), alongside the continuous driving influence of \\\\( iA \\\\). The result is a composite effect influenced by all the constants.",
