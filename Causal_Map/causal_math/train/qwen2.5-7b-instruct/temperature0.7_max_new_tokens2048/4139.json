  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{mt} \\\\\\) where \\\\( m \\\\) is a complex number, evolving in a system governed by the differential equation \\\\( z'(t) = kz(t) \\\\\\), with \\\\( k \\\\) being a real constant. We explore the effect of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{nt}z \\\\), applied at different times, where \\\\( n \\\\) is another complex number.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{pt}z \\\\) (where \\\\( p \\\\) is a complex number) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 only depend on \\\\( k \\\\) and not on \\\\( m, n \\\\) or \\\\( p \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) further alters the trajectory initiated by \\\\( f(z) \\\\), making the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) a product of interactions between \\\\( m, n, p, \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\). Each exponent contributes differently, influencing both magnitude and phase of the solution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
