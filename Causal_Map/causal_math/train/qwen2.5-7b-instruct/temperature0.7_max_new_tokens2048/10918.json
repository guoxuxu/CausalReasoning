  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a time-varying two-dimensional system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where \\\\(M\\\\) is a constant 2x2 matrix. We explore the consequence of intervention through a transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{Nt}z\\\\), where \\\\(N\\\\) is another constant 2x2 matrix.\n\nCan the original state \\\\(z_0\\\\) be determined precisely from \\\\(z(T)\\\\) observed at time T, if it is unknown whether the transformation \\\\(h(z)\\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Lacking knowledge about the application of transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{Nt}z\\\\), retracing to the original state \\\\(z_0\\\\) would be ambiguous as the transformation could have altered it in a manner dependent on the structure of matrix \\\\(N\\\\), which might not possibly be inferred from the final state alone, especially if \\\\(N\\\\) and \\\\(M\\\\) do not commute.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
