  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t represents time and i is the imaginary unit. This function describes a unit circle in the complex plane. We study the effect of the linear transformation \\\\( f(z) = Az \\\\) where A is a complex number, representing multiplication and rotation in the complex plane.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine exactly which transformations (values of A or B, or their sequence) were used, assuming multiple interventions might have occurred during the interval [0, T]?",
  "Explanation": "Because of the complex exponential function's periodic and rotating nature, different sequences of A and B could lead to the same endpoint on the unit circle. The overlap in potential transformations makes it impossible to definitively identify the exact interventions and their sequence.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
