  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}w \\\\), where A is a real constant and w is a complex constant vector. This scenario investigates the impact of a transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(w) = e^{iBt}w \\\\) where B is also a real constant, and how it modifies the system's dynamics over time t.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( w_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(w) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on whether the transformation \\\\( h(w) \\\\) occurred, determining \\\\( w_0 \\\\) purely based on the system state at t = T is challenging. The possibility that B may have altered the trajectory makes recovery of \\\\( w_0 \\\\) ambiguous, especially without additional information about the transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
