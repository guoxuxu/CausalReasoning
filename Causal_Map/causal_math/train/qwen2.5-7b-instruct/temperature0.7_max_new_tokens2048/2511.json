  "Problem": "Assume a linear transformation system controlled by the Laplace transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\\\) applied to a set of differential equations. We explore scenarios involving both the initial application of transforms and subsequent interventions through inverse Laplace transform \\\\( L^{-1}[F(s)] \\\\) at different stages.\n\nIf an intervention involving applying an additional Laplace transform \\\\( L[g(t)] = G(s) \\\\) is made at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the endpoint still solely depend on the initial Laplace transform \\\\( L[f(t)] \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a new transform as an intervention modifies the original system's state space and affects terminal conditions. Since the effect of the second Laplace transform could be independent or potentially even counteractive, the end condition depends on both transforms.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying an additional Laplace transform L[g(t)] at time t_1 leads to G(s), which influences the endpoint. The initial Laplace transform L[f(t)] also leads to F(s) that influences the same endpoint. Therefore, the endpoint depends on both F(s) and G(s)."
