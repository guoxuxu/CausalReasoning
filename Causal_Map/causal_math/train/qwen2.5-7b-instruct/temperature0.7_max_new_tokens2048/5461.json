  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system governed by the differential equation \\(\\\\dot{x} = Kx\\), where K is a constant matrix. Investigate the system's behavior under the transformation \\( g(x) = Q^{-1}x \\) over time t, where Q is a constant and invertible matrix.\n\nIf \\( g(x) \\) is applied to a vector \\( x_0 \\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\(\\\\dot{x} = Kx\\) without further intervention, will \\( x(t) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( x_0 \\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\(\\\\dot{x} = Kx\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( g(x) \\) to \\( x_0 \\) at t = 0 alters the initial condition to \\( x_0' = Q^{-1}x_0 \\). The system evolves from \\( x_0' \\) under \\(\\\\dot{x} = Kx\\), and due to this changed initial condition, \\( x(t) \\) at t = T will generally not match the state had \\( x_0 \\) been evolved with no transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation g(x_0) = Q^{-1}x_0 to x_0 at t=0 and evolving it under \\\\dot{x} = Kx for time T results in the same state x(t) as directly evolving x_0 under \\\\dot{x} = Kx for the same time period, due to the properties of linear transformations and the constancy of K."
