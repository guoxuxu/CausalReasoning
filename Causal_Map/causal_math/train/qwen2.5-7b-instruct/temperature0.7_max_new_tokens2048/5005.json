  "Problem": "Consider a complex function mapping operation where \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) evolves over time under the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t} z \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a constant real number and \\\\( i \\\\) representing the imaginary unit.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) then evolves under the rule \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = cz \\\\) for some constant complex number c without further intervention, will the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to the evolution of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) directly under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = cz \\\\) for the same period?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t} z \\\\) rotates \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in the complex plane, altering its path distinctly from merely evolving under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = cz \\\\). This affects the trajectory and ultimately the position of \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "h(z_0) → z(0); z(0) → z(t); z(t) → z(T); c → z(t); T → z(T)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation h(z) to z_0 at t=0 yields z(0), which then evolves over time t according to the differential equation z'(t) = c*z(t) to become z(T) at time T; the constant c directly influences z(t)'s evolution; the duration T determines when the evolution ends."
