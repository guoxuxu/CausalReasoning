  "Problem": "Consider a continuous-time system described by a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) evolves according to the linear partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a real constant. Examine the impact of an integral transformation given by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to follow \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the same differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) fundamentally alters the trajectory by taking a complex weighted integral of the original function over time, resulting in a function of \\\\( s \\\\). This transformation is non-trivial and permanently changes the representation and values of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), thereby affecting its state at any further time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The function z(t) influences its derivative dz/dt through the differential equation. The function z(t) also influences g(z) via the integral transformation. g(z) in turn determines z(T)."
