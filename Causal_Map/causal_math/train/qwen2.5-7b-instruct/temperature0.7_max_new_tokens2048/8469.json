  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\( z(t) \\) evolving over time according to \\( \\dot{z} = i \\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We analyze the impact of the transformation \\( f(z) = e^{it}z \\) applied at different time points.\n\nIf \\( f(z) \\) is applied to a complex number \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\( \\dot{z} = i \\omega z \\) without further intervention, will \\( z(t) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( z_0 \\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\( \\dot{z} = i \\omega z \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\( f(z) \\) modifies the initial condition by introducing an additional phase rotation of \\( e^{it} \\) at t = 0. This initial phase shift changes the trajectory of \\( z(t) \\), leading to a different result at time T compared to direct evolution under \\( \\dot{z} = i \\omega z \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial complex number z_0 directly causes z(t) through evolution under the differential equation. Applying the transformation f(z) at t=0 and then evolving under the differential equation causes z(t) to be equivalent to directly evolving z_0 under the same equation for the same duration."
