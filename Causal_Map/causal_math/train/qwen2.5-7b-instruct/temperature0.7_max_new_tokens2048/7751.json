  "Problem": "Examine the causal effects in a system governed by a Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = F(s) \\\\) of a function f(t), focusing on the response of systems described by the transfer function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s + a} \\\\) where a is a constant.\n\nIf an intervention by modifying the system's transfer function to \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{(s + a)(s + c)} \\\\) (with \\\\( c \\\\) as another constant) is applied at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the system's output at time \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) be independent of \\\\( b \\\\) in the input function?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention alters the system's transfer function, and thus affects how the input signal \\\\( f(t) = e^{-bt} \\\\) is processed. The response still depends on both the original parameter \\\\( b \\\\) in the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and the new parameter \\\\( c \\\\) added to \\\\( a \\\\). The output remains a function of these parameters as well as their interaction in the new transfer function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Modifying the system's transfer function from H(s) = 1/(s + a) to H(s) = 1/((s + a)(s + c)) changes the system response, which then affects the system's output for times t > t1. The original variable b in the input function does not directly cause changes in the system's output after the modification."
