  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the following operator equation \\( \\mathcal{L}(x) = D^2x + 2x \\) where \\( D \\) represents the differential operator with respect to variable \\( t \\). Assess how the introduction of a Laplace transformation \\( \\mathcal{F}(x(t)) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}x(t) \\, dt \\) modifies the system.\n\nGiven the transformed state \\( \\mathcal{F}(x(t)) \\) at \\( s = s_0 \\), is it possible to reconstruct the exact state \\( x(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) without prior knowledge of whether the system was subjected to the Laplace transformation?",
  "Explanation": "If \\( \\mathcal{F}(x(t)) \\) is observed, using the inverse Laplace transform, one can determine \\( x(t) \\) quite accurately, irrespective of our knowledge about the usage of the Laplace transformation in the process, assuming the transformation was linear and reversible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The second derivative of x with respect to t plus two times x directly causes the application of the Laplace transform L, which then directly causes the transformed state F, which can potentially influence the state x at time T."
