  "Problem": "Examine a system governed by Laplace's equation \\\\(\\\\Delta u = 0\\\\) in a domain, with boundary conditions defined by the prescription \\\\(u = g\\\\) on the boundary. An integral transformation \\\\(f(u) = \\\\int_{0}^{T} e^{At} u dt\\\\), where A is a constant matrix, is considered over a period [0, T].\n\nIf after a time T the function is found to be \\\\(f(u)\\\\), can we deduce the original function \\\\(u\\\\) (satisfying Laplace's equation) at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Recovering the original function \\\\(u\\\\) that satisfies Laplace’s equation from its integral transformation \\\\(f(u)\\\\) is generally not possible without additional information, as multiple different functions could yield the same transformed output due to the nature of integral and matrix exponential operations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The original function u at t=0 influences f(u) through the integral transformation defined by A and T. The boundary condition g influences u, which in turn affects f(u) via the transformation."
