  "Problem": "Examine a system characterized by the non-linear differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dx}{dt} = x^2 - 2x + 1 \\\\), and consider the impact of a transformation given by \\\\( g(x) = x + k \\\\) where k is a constant.\n\nAssuming that at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( h(x) = x - k \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend exclusively on the differential equation, unaltered by the effects of k?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention through transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) just as it was beginning to evolve after the application of \\\\( g(x) \\\\), will alter the pathway and the endpoint. Both effects of k and the non-linear nature of the differential equation play roles in determining the trajectory and consequently the final state at T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of x at any time t is influenced by the differential equation dx/dt = (x-1)^2. The transformations g(x) = x + k and h(x) = x - k do not alter the fundamental relationship between dx/dt and x, but rather shift x values by k. Thus, the endpoint x(T) for T > t_1 depends on the initial conditions and the differential equation, not solely on k."
