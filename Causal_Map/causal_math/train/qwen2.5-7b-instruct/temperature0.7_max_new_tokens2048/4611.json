  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) applied to a control system governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We analyze the behavior of the system under the influence of the transformation \\\\( f(x) = e^{At}x \\\\), where A is another matrix.\n\nIf a new function \\\\( g(x) = e^{Bt}x \\\\) (where B is another matrix) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be unaffected by the initial matrix A?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(x) = e^{Bt}x \\\\) does not nullify the effects of the initial transformation \\\\( e^{At}x \\\\). The system’s trajectory is now influenced by both A and B applied at different times, leading to a final state that depends on the interaction and possibly non-commutative properties of A and B in addition to D.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "A directly influences f(x), and B directly influences g(x); applying g(x) at t1 will change x(T) if T > t1, thus affecting x(T). The initial matrix A does not directly affect x(T) after t1 due to the intervention by g(x)."
