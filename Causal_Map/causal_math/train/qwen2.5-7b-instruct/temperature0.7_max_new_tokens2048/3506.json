  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit modeled with a complex function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) representing impedance, and a Laplace transformation \\\\( L \\\\) which converts time-domain functions into the s-domain. The action is analyzing the behavior of the current function \\\\( I(t) \\\\) when subjected to an input voltage \\\\( V(t) = V_0 e^{st} \\\\).\n\nIs it possible to precisely infer the exact form of the initial voltage function \\\\( V(t) \\\\) only by observing the resultant current function \\\\( I(t) \\\\) without any knowledge of the interventions or transformations applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the specific impedance \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) or any transformations that might have been performed, deducing \\\\( V(t) \\\\) from \\\\( I(t) \\\\) is not straightforward. The impedance function can vastly alter the response, meaning the exact input voltage function cannot be uniquely determined just from the current.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
