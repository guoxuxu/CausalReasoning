  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where a set of points \\\\( z \\\\) in the complex plane undergoes a transformation defined by the function \\\\( w(z) = e^{iz} \\\\). Post-transformation, these points are subjected to an integral transformation, \\\\( T(w) = \\\\int_{0}^{2\\\\pi} e^{iw} dw \\\\).\n\nGiven solely the output from \\\\( T(v) \\\\) after the intervention \\\\( v(w) = w^2 \\\\), is it possible to identify distinctly whether the original transformation \\\\( w(z) \\\\) or the intervening transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of multiple transformations complicates identifying the specific transformations used based on the integral transformation outcome. \\\\( v(w) = w^2 \\\\) intertwines effects from the initial and intervention transformations, making it impossible to distinguish them independently from the final outcome alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
