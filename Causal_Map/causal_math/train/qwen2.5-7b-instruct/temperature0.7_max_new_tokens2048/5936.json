  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where both \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) obey the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z = iAz \\\\), with A being a real constant. We explore the scenario by applying the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nKnowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for some T > t_1 (after applying the perturbation \\\\( p(t) \\\\)), is it possible to infer the specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and constant B used in \\\\( p(t) \\\\) just from \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The effect observed at time T could result from varying the parameters B and \\\\( t_1 \\\\) in different ways, due to the nature of exponential functions and differential equations. There are potentially multiple combinations of \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and B that could result in the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\), making precise determination ambiguous.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z at time T depends on the initial conditions (including u(t) and v(t)), the differential equation parameter A, and the perturbation p(t). The Fourier transform F(z)(ω) of z(t) provides information about z(t) across all frequencies. Knowing z(T) does not directly reveal the specific times t_1 or the constant B used in p(t)."
