  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = a+bt+ict^2 \\\\), where \\\\( a, b, c \\\\) are constants, and study the application of a Fourier Transform, defined by \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf a damping factor \\\\( e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a positive constant) is applied as an intervention at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) at \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) only depend on the new modified coefficients and not on the original values of \\\\( a, b, c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the damping factor modifies the whole function and its respective Fourier Transform, but it operates as a multiplicative factor in time-domain, affecting the resulting Fourier Transform. Therefore, the transformed function's spectrum depends on both the original function's characteristics and the characteristics of the damping.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
