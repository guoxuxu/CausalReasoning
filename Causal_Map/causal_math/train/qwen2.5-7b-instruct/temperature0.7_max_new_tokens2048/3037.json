  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) represent real parts dependent on a parameter \\\\( t \\\\). The function is subjected to transformation through the Laplace Transform \\\\( L \\\\), defined as \\\\( L\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t)dt \\\\), with \\\\( s \\\\) being a complex number.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed using the Laplace Transform at t = 0 and evolves under its own dynamics, will the transformed function \\\\( L\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\) at s = T reflect only the properties inherent to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without modification?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform inherently captures all aspects and dynamics of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). As this operation is linear and does not involve any external modifications post-transformation, the function primarily reflects \\\\( z(t) \\\\)'s inherent properties in its transform space.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The parameter t influences the real parts u(t) and v(t) of the function z(t), which in turn is transformed by the Laplace Transform L into L{z(t)}, where the value of s affects the transformed function."
