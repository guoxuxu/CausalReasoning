  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( z(x) = \\\\int_0^x e^{t^2} dt \\\\) characterizing a process dependent on the variable x. We further explore how the transformations through application of a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\), defined by \\\\( L(z) = z'(x) \\\\), impact the outcomes when \\\\( z(x) \\\\) evolves under a complex function \\\\( w(z) = z^2 + i \\\\), where i is the imaginary unit.\n\nIf we allow \\\\( z(x) \\\\) to evolve under the transformation \\\\( w(z) \\\\) without applying \\\\( L \\\\), will \\\\( w(z(x)) \\\\) be the same as evolving \\\\( z'(x) \\\\) under \\\\( w(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The direct application of \\\\( w \\\\) to \\\\( z(x) \\\\) does not involve the differential operation of \\\\( L \\\\). Therefore, the output from evolving under \\\\( w \\\\) would typically differ from the transformation after applying the operator \\\\( L \\\\), as this operator alters the function's derivative structure before applying \\\\( w \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of z(x) under w(z) results in w(z(x)), while the application of the linear operator L to z(x) to obtain z'(x) and then evolving it under w(z) results in w(z'(x)). These two processes are distinct."
