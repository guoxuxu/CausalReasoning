  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transformation \\\\( L\\{ f(t) \\} = F(s) \\), where \\\\( f(t) \\) is the original function in the time domain and \\\\( F(s) \\) its image in the complex domain. An intervention is represented by the multiplication of \\\\( F(s) \\) with a complex exponential \\\\( e^{as} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real number.\n\nGiven the observation of the system output at time \\\\( T \\\\) due to the modified transform \\\\( F(s) \\cdot e^{as} \\\\), can we definitively infer the specific intervention (value of \\\\( a \\\\)) applied?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting time-domain function, although distinct, does not provide unambiguous evidence of the specific shift \\\\( a \\\\) unless additional data or constraints are known. Multiple values of \\\\( a \\\\) can lead to similar or indistinguishable modifications in the function's behavior, particularly without precise prior information about \\\\( f(t) \\\\) or the nature of other potential transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The original function f(t) transforms into F(s) via the Laplace transformation; multiplying F(s) by e^(as) represents an intervention; this modified transform F(s) * e^(as) results in the system output f(T) at time T."
