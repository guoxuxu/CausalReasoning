  "Problem": "Consider a linear system with a function transformation defined by \\\\( z(x) = \\int_0^x t^kf(t) dt \\\\) where k is a constant and f is a differentiable function. The impact of the linear operation transformation \\\\( L[z(x)] = \\int_0^x z(t) dt \\\\) is analyzed over the interval [0, x].\n\nGiven the outcome of \\\\( L[z(x)] \\\\) at x, can we determine exactly what modification (original or intervened by \\\\( g(t) \\\\)) was applied in calculating \\\\( z(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple configurations of f(t) and potential interventions with different m values could result in the same outcome in \\\\( L[z(x)] \\\\), due to the integrating nature aggregating and potentially obfuscating distinct differences. Without explicit information about m or the function forms prior to intervention, it is not possible to precisely deduce the path taken.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function f(t) directly influences z(x) through integration. z(x) then directly influences L[z(x)] through further integration. An intervention by g(t) could modify z(x), but without additional information, it's unclear how this intervention affects the determination of the original form of z(x) from L[z(x)]."
