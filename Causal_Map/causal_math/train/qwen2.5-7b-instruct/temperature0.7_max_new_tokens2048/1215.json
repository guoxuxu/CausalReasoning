  "Problem": "Consider an electrical RLC circuit where the response \\( V(t) \\) over time t is governed by the differential equation \\( L\\frac{d^2V}{dt^2} + R\\frac{dV}{dt} + \\frac{1}{C}V = 0 \\), with L representing inductance, R resistance, and C capacitance. We explore the behavior following a Laplace transform of the voltage signal \\( V(t) \\), represented as \\( \\hat{V}(s) \\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies the resistance \\( R \\) to \\( R' \\) at time \\( t_1 \\), will the resulting Laplace transform \\( \\hat{V}(s) \\) for \\( t > t_1 \\) depend only on the new resistance \\( R' \\) and not on the original \\( R \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the resistance from \\( R \\) to \\( R' \\) partway through the circuit's operation introduces a discontinuity in the system’s response, which affects both the transient and steady-state solution of the system. The resulting Laplace transform \\( \\hat{V}(s) \\) will indeed depend on both the original and modified values of resistance, as well as how these changes interact with other circuit parameters (L and C).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "A change in resistance R at time t_1 directly affects the voltage response V(t) for t > t_1, and this effect persists such that the resulting Laplace transform \\(\\hat{V}(s)\\) depends on the new resistance R' and not on the original R."
