  "Problem": "Assume a complex-valued function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i \\\\omega z\\\\), with \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) being a real constant. We consider the impact of a Fourier transform operation, \\\\(F[\\\\cdot]\\\\), applied to \\\\(z(t)\\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\(F[z(t)]\\\\) is computed at t = 0 and \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is subsequently evolved according to the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i \\\\omega z\\\\) without further intervention, will the form of the Fourier transform at time T be identical to what would be computed directly from \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform at t = 0 captures the frequency content of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at that initial condition, which constitutes a spectrum focused around \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\). However, as \\\\(z(t)\\\\) evolves, the phase changes and while the frequency domain representation retains focus around \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), the specific complex coefficients in the Fourier transform would change due to phase shift, indicating different results.",
