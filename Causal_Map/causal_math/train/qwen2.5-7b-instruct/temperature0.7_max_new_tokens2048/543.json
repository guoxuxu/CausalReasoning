  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by a system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax(t) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By(t) \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We introduce the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant matrix, to observe changes over time t.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), for T > t_1, depend solely on A and B, not considering C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) as an intervention changes the trajectory path, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on the dynamics and interactions of A, B, C, and D. The effects from matrices C and D cannot be ignored as they may have substantial influence on the final state due to their exponential interactions with the original system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
