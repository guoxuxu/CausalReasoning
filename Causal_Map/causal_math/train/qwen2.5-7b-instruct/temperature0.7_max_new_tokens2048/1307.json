  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) over time \\( t \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant frequency. We analyze the changes in the output when a transformation defined by \\( g(z) = \\int_0^t z(s) \\, ds \\) is applied to \\( z(t) \\).\n\nIf at time \\( t_1 \\), a new transformation \\( h(z) = dz/dt \\) is applied as an intervention, will the form of \\( y(t) \\) for \\( t > t_1 \\) depend only on the dynamics of \\( \\omega \\) and not on the previous transformations or \\( t_1 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( h(z) \\) at \\( t_1 \\) immediately changes the evolution of \\( y(t) \\), basing it on the derivative of \\( z(t) \\), which will still depend on \\( \\omega \\). However, the effects of the integral transformation up to \\( t_1 \\) will have accumulated, thus altering the state of \\( y(t) \\) starting from \\( t_1 \\). Therefore, \\( y(t) \\)'s resultant form depends on both the prior transformation and the frequency, \\( \\omega \\), showing dependence on \\( t_1 \\) as well.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The frequency ω directly influences the form of z(t), which in turn directly influences the form of y(t). At time t1, applying the transformation h(z) introduces a new dynamic that affects y(t) for t > t1, but this new dynamic is independent of the previous transformations or the specific time t1."
