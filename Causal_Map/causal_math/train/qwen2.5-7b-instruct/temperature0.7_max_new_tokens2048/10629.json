  "Problem": "We are investigating the temperature dynamics in a material described by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta u \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity and \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) is the Laplacian operator. Consider the effect of a thermal control method described by the function \\\\( f(u) = e^{\\\\alpha t}u \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(u) \\\\) is applied to a state \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta u \\\\) without further intervention, will the temperature distribution \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the same differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( f(u) = e^{\\\\alpha t}u \\\\) modifies the initial condition by scaling \\\\( u_0 \\\\). This scaling alters the response of the system to the heat equation, causing a difference in the temperature distribution at any time T due to exponential growth factors introduced by \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the function f(u) to the initial state u_0 changes the temperature distribution u(t) over time; the thermal diffusivity κ and the Laplacian operator Δ also affect u(t) as they describe how the temperature evolves according to the partial differential equation."
