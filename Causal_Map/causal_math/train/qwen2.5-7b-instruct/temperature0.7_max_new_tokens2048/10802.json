  "Problem": "Consider the complex function defined as \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\). Investigate the effects of a transformation by matrix \\( M \\) where \\( M \\) effects the amplitude and frequency. The transformed variable is \\( w(t) = M z(t) \\). Let's analyze using variable separation and integral transformations.\n\nIf the trajectory \\( w(t) \\) is observed until t = T, can we deduce the exact initial matrix \\( M \\) used during transformation of \\( z(t) \\) at t = 0 given no further data?",
  "Explanation": "Since multiple matrices may result in similar transformations depending on their eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and given the complex function evolution, it's impossible to uniquely retrieve \\( M \\) without additional constraints or information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
