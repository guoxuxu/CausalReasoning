  "Problem": "Assume a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\(L[f(t)] = F(s)\\\\) of a function. We are examining the influence of an operation defined by the multiplier \\\\( M(s) = s^n \\\\), where n is an integer, on the transformed function.\n\nIf \\\\( M(s) \\\\) is initially applied to the Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) to generate \\\\( G(s) = s^n F(s) \\\\), then removed and allowed to operate under normal differential settings, will \\\\( L^{-1}[G(s)](t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( F(s) \\\\) was directly operated on to generate a function at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\\\( M(s) = s^n \\\\) modifies \\\\( F(s) \\\\) by effectively enhancing higher order derivatives of the original function, associated with the multiplication by \\\\( s^n \\\\) in Laplace space. This operation yields a different function \\\\( t^n * f(t) \\\\), altering the course and behavior of the inverse transform at any further time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the multiplier M(s) = s^n to F(s) results in G(s) = s^n F(s), and the inverse Laplace transform of G(s) at t = T is the same as directly applying the inverse Laplace transform to F(s) at t = T."
