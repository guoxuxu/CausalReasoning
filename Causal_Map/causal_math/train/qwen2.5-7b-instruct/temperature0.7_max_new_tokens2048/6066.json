  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( bi \\\\) are real and imaginary components of the complex exponent respectively. The system is subject to the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{(c+di)t}z \\\\), with \\\\( c \\\\), \\\\( d \\\\) being constants. Analyze the evolution and causality of this system over time.\n\nGiven the observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), is it possible to infer the initial conditions and the parameters \\\\( a, b \\\\) without knowledge of the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied, one cannot accurately determine if the changes in the state were due to the initial exponent parameters \\\\( a, b \\\\) or a combination of the initial conditions altered by \\\\( c, d \\\\). The interaction between these complex exponentials complicates back-calculations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
