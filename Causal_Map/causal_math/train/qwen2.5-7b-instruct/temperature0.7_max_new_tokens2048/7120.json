  "Problem": "Let \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s^2 + \\omega^2} \\\\) represent a transfer function in the Laplace transform domain, where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We consider the impact of applying a sinusoidal input \\\\( x(t) = \\sin(\\omega t) \\\\) and an impulsive function \\\\( \\delta(t - T) \\\\) as inputs into the system described by H(s).\n\nGiven the output data at time \\\\( t = T + \\epsilon \\\\), can we determine precisely whether there was an intervention with \\\\( \\delta(t - T) \\\\) or if the output changes were solely due to the sinusoidal input \\\\( \\sin(\\omega t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining whether the output change at \\\\( t = T + \\epsilon \\\\) was due to the sinusoidal input or the impulsive intervention is challenging without additional context or data. The nature of the output change caused by the impulse may not be distinctly identifiable from the input, especially if the system's response to the sine wave near time T inherently varies or overlaps with the impulse effect.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "A sinusoidal input x(t) and an impulsive input delta(t - T) both affect the system H(s), which in turn determines the output."
