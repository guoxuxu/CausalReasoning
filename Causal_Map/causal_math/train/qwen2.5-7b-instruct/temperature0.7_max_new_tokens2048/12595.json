  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( g(z) = e^{z} \\\\), and let an integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) be defined by \\\\( T(g) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} g(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex parameter. The study involves analyzing how transformations affect the function and its integration outcomes.\n\nGiven the outcome after changing the parameter during transformation to \\\\( s' \\\\), is it possible to definitively determine if the original parameter was \\\\( s \\\\) or some other value based on the transformed result alone?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple parameters could lead to similar or indistinguishable results upon transformation due to the nature of the exponential function and its integration, making it impossible to distinctly identify the original parameter \\\\( s \\\\) used before switching to \\\\( s' \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
