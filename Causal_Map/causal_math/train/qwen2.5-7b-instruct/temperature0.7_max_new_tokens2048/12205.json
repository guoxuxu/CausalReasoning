  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear transformation \\\\( L: \\\\mathbb{C}^n \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C}^n \\\\), defined by the matrix \\\\( M \\\\). An external operation \\\\( T(t) = e^{Nt} \\\\) with \\\\( N \\\\) being another constant matrix, acts on the state space over time. The impact of this operation on the initial conditions and subsequent system behavior is studied.\n\nIf only the resultant state at t = T is given, can we uniquely determine the initial state without knowledge of whether the operation \\\\( T(t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing just the transformed state at t = T without any information about application of \\\\( T(t) \\\\) does not permit backtracking to the initial conditions uniquely, especially if N does not commute with M. Multiple different initial states could evolve to the same final state under different sequences and timings of applying \\\\( T(t) \\\\) and \\\\( L \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
