  "Problem": "Consider a linear system where the state vector \\\\( x \\\\) at any given time \\\\( t \\\\) is governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\\\), with a control input \\\\( u \\\\). Here, A is a constant matrix defining the system dynamics and B is the control matrix. An operator applies a transformation \\\\( T(t) = e^{Ct}x \\\\), where C is another constant matrix determining a specific kind of state transformation.\n\nDoes the transformation \\\\( T(t) = e^{Ct}x \\\\) applied at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) affect the evolution of the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) under the system dynamics \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\\\) without any further control adjustments (i.e., \\\\( u = 0 \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(t) = e^{Ct}x \\\\) modifies the initial condition by setting a different starting point for the system's evolution. Therefore, even with \\\\( u = 0 \\\\), the resultant trajectory of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) will differ because the system evolves from this altered initial state, influenced by the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
