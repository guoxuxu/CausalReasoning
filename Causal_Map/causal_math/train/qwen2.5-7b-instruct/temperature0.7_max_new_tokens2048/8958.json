  "Problem": "Given a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) a real constant. We examine the effect of applying the Fourier transform \\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nBy observing the Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any time \\\\( t \\\\), is it possible to uniquely identify the initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing \\\\( t \\\\) at which the Fourier transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) focuses exclusively on frequency components and does not retain phase information specific to the value of \\\\( t \\\\). Since \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\) alters phase over time but retains the same frequency components, the initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\), especially its phase relative to time, cannot be uniquely determined without additional information about \\\\( t \\\\).",
