  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{gz} \\\\) where g is a complex constant. This function is used to transform the path of integration in the complex plane for the integral \\\\( I = \\\\int_C e^{z^2} dz \\\\), where C is initially the real axis from -∞ to +∞.\n\nIf a new transforming function \\\\( h(z) = e^{mz} \\\\) (where m is another complex constant) is applied at a midpoint during the integral's evaluation along \\\\( C' \\\\), will the final value of \\\\( I \\\\) solely depend on the original function \\\\( e^{z^2} \\\\) without influence from g or m?",
  "Explanation": "The application of another transforming function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces further modification to the path and potentially to the domain characteristics relevant for the integral. The ultimate value of \\\\( I \\\\) will thus depend not only on the original function but also critically on the influence of both transformations imposed by g and m, affecting how the poles, residues, or branch cuts are navigated.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
