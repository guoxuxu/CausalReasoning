  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, governed by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. The function is subjected to a Fourier Transform, defined by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt\\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) at time T, can we determine if an intervention (like scaling of \\\\( x(t) \\\\)) occurred, only by analyzing the results at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform at a specific frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) incorporates contributions from both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) but does not contain explicit markers of interventions unless such alterations distinctively affect the spectral characteristics at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Thus, pinpointing an intervention like scaling based solely on \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) is not feasible without additional contextual data.",
