  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolves over time under the influence of a differential operator \\\\( D \\\\), represented by \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = Az(t) \\\\), where A is a constant matrix. An integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T(z)(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{B(s-t)}z(s) ds \\\\), where B is another constant matrix, is applied intermittently.\n\nKnowing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we unequivocally determine the interventions used (whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( U(z) \\\\), or both) based solely on the outcome observed at time T?",
  "Explanation": "The potential overlap in the influences of the transformations \\\\( T(z) \\\\) and \\\\( U(z) \\\\) renders it challenging to backtrack and identify the specific interventions. Both transformations modify the path of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in possibly nonunique ways, leading to ambiguities concerning their individual or combined impacts at any given time point.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of z(t) over time is driven by the differential operator A; the integral transformation T modifies z(t) through the matrix B; knowing z(T) allows inference about the interventions applied, which could be T(z), U(z), or both."
