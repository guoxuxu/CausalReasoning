  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\( U_{xx} = -\\\\lambda U \\\\) where \\\\( U(x, t) \\\\) is a function of space x and time t, and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant. Study the effects of applying a Fourier transform over space, resulting in the transformed function \\\\( \\\\hat{U}(k, t) \\\\), and analyze its behavior under the spatial transform \\\\( G(k) = e^{-\\\\alpha k^2 t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is another constant.\n\nIf the Fourier transform is applied to \\\\( U(x, 0) \\\\) and then allowed to evolve until time t without further alteration, will \\\\( \\\\hat{U}(k, t) \\\\) at time t be solely influenced by \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) without any contribution from \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "When the Fourier transform is applied initially without subsequent modification, the evolution of \\\\( \\\\hat{U}(k, t) \\\\) is governed purely by the partial differential equation, represented in the k-domain by \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\hat{U}}{\\\\partial t} = -\\\\lambda k^2 \\\\hat{U} \\\\). Thus, \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) does not influence the solution in this scenario.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
