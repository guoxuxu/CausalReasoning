  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-dependent system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + A\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0\\\\), where A is a constant coefficient. An integral transform \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int e^{ikx} u(x, t) \\\\, dx \\\\) is applied to the function u(x, t).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T(u) \\\\) is applied initially to the function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) and the resulting function is then evolved according to the given partial differential equation without further transformations, will the transformed function at time T be the same as if \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) was transformed at t = T directly?",
  "Explanation": "The linear PDE with constant coefficients is compatible under integral transforms with time and space variables separated. Therefore, transforming initially or after evolving the function will yield the same result due to the time-invariance of the system and the properties of the Fourier transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial function u(x, 0) transforms to T(u) via the integral transform, which then evolves according to the PDE to become u(x, t). This u(x, t) further transforms to T(u, t) at any time t. Thus, applying the transform at t=0 and evolving, or transforming at t=T after evolution, results in the same T(u, t)."
