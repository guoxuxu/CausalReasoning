  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( w(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) and subsequently transformed by a function \\\\( h(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\), where \\\\(z\\\\) is a complex variable. We explore the behavior of this system under various transformations and interventions.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( w(z(T)) \\\\), can we precisely identify what transformations or interventions (\\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were applied based solely on \\\\( w(z(T)) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The overlap in effects caused by non-linear and linear transformations from \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) prevents us from distinctly determining which transformations were applied at what times. Given that both can influence the trajectory and state at T, identifying specific interventions from \\\\( w(z(T)) \\\\) becomes unfeasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
