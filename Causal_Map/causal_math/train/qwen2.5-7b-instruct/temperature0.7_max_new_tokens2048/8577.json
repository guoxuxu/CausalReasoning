  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving in a potential V(x) in one dimension governed by the Hamiltonian \\\\( H = \\\\frac{p^2}{2m} + V(x) \\\\). We investigate the effect of a linear transformation of the momentum variable \\\\( p \\\\) by a function \\\\( g(p) = ap \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant scaling factor.\n\nIf \\\\( g(p) \\\\) is applied to the momentum \\\\( p_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and the system is then allowed to evolve under the Hamiltonian \\\\( H \\\\) without further intervention, will the position \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at time t = T be the same as if \\\\( p_0 \\\\) was directly evolved under \\\\( H \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(p) = ap \\\\) changes the initial momentum, which affects the kinetic energy term \\\\( \\\\frac{p^2}{2m} \\\\) in the Hamiltonian, leading to a different trajectory and thus a different position \\\\( x(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the linear transformation g(p) to the initial momentum p0 changes the Hamiltonian H and consequently the evolution of position x(t) over time."
