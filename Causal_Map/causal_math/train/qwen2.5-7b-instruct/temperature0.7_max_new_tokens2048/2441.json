  "Problem": "Consider a stochastic process \\\\( X(t) \\\\) modeled by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{X} = AX + BU \\\\) where A and B are constant matrices and U is a control input. We study the impact of an integral transformation \\\\( T(X) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-Cs}X(s) ds \\\\), with C being a constant matrix, on the behavior of the process.\n\nIf no interventions are applied, and the control input U remains constant, is the output of the transformation \\\\( T(X) \\\\) at time T solely determined by matrices A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The output of the transformation \\\\( T(X) \\\\) also depends on the matrix C and the integration process over time. The dynamics of X are shaped by A and B via the differential equation, but the integral transformation with C infuses additional dependency, which alters the cumulative effect observed at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
