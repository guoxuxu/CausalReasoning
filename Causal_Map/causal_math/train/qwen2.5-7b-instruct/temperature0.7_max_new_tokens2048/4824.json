  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform defined by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\), where f(t) represents a time-dependent function and s is a complex number. An input signal f(t) is being studied for its transformation and response properties under different conditions and manipulations.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\( G(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-(a+b)} \\\\), can we determine precisely which intervention (value of b) was used on \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} \\\\), solely from the output \\\\( G(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While we know that an intervention in the form of a time-shift was applied, multiple values of b could lead to the same form of \\\\( G(s) \\\\). Without additional information about the specific magnitude or type of intervention, it is impossible to determine the exact value of b from \\\\( G(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-(a+b)} \\\\). The transformation output alone does not uniquely identify the parameters of the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of b influences G(s) through its effect on the poles of the Laplace transform, while a determines the form of f(t). Given F(s) and G(s), we can infer the relationship between a and b."
