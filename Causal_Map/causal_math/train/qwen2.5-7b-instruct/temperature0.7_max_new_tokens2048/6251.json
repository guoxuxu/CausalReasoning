  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\Delta u = 0\\\\) in a domain \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\). The domain boundary \\\\(\\\\partial\\\\Omega\\\\) has been split into two parts, where on \\\\(\\\\partial\\\\Omega_1\\\\) the function \\\\(u\\\\) is held fixed at zero, and on \\\\(\\\\partial\\\\Omega_2\\\\), a non-homogeneous Neumann boundary condition is applied involving the function \\\\(h(x)\\\\) by \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial n} = h(x)\\\\). We examine the effect of modifying the Neumann boundary condition by a function \\\\(g(x,t)\\\\) which depends on position and time.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), the function \\\\(g(x, t) = e^tx\\\\) is introduced as a new boundary condition on \\\\(\\\\partial\\\\Omega_2\\\\), will the solution \\\\(u(x)\\\\) at a later time \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) depend only on the modified Neumann condition and not on the original \\\\(h(x)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(g(x, t)\\\\) adds a time-dependent factor to the boundary condition, affecting \\\\(u(x)\\\\) at time T. The solution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) results from both the original and the modified boundary conditions due to the superposition principle and the dependence on previous boundary conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
