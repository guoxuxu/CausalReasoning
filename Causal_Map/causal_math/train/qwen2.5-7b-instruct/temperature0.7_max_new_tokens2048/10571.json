  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of a function \\\\( z(x, y) = x^2 + iy^2 \\\\) under a transformation \\\\( T(r, s) = \\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} e^{-i\\\\theta} z(r\\\\cos(\\\\theta), s\\\\sin(\\\\theta)) d\\\\theta \\\\), where i is the imaginary unit.\n\nIf an additional transformation function \\\\( U(q, p) = P \\\\cdot z(q + p, q - p) \\\\) is applied where \\\\( P \\\\) is a permutation matrix, and later \\\\( T(r, s) \\\\) is applied, will the outcome depend solely on the nature of \\\\( U \\\\) and disregard \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both transformations affect the function's outcome. While \\\\( U(q, p) \\\\) might permute or transform its inputs thereby altering \\\\( z(x, y) \\\\), applying \\\\( T(r, s) \\\\) further integrates these changes over a different path, and both function transformations compound to influence the final result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The function z evaluated at (r*cos(theta), s*sin(theta)) directly causes T(r, s). The function U evaluated at (q + p, q - p) and multiplied by P directly causes the input to T(r, s)."
