  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving in a potential field described by the potential function \\\\( V(x) = -\\\\alpha x^2 + \\\\beta x^4 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) are constants. Investigate the effects of perturbing the initial position of the particle using a transformation \\\\( g(x) = x + \\\\delta \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\) is a small constant, on the system's long-term behavior.\n\nAfter observing the position of the particle at a later time \\\\( t = T \\\\), can we conclusively determine the unperturbed initial position \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without knowing whether a perturbation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given the nonlinear nature of the potential field, the final observed position at \\\\( t = T \\\\) could result from different initial conditions due to the sensitivity to initial perturbations. Without knowing whether the perturbation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied, it is impossible to uniquely determine the initial position.",
