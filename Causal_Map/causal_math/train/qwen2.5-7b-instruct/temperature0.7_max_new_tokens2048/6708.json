  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = te^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. The function is subjected to an integral transformation given by \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s}f(s) ds \\\\).\n\nCan the specific nature of the intervention (e.g., increasing t by 1 after t_1) be determined uniquely by analyzing the transformed outcome \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) at some later time T?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the integral's cumulative and non-reversible nature, the exact nature of modifications (like the specific change in t or alterations in the function's structure) during the intervention cannot be determined uniquely from the outcome. Multiple different interventions could lead to similar or indistinguishable results in the transformed function, obscuring precise identification.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
