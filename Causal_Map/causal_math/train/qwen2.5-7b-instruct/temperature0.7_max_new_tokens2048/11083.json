  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) passed through an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) described by the kernel \\\\( K(t, s) = e^{-(t-s)^2} \\\\), such that the transformed function is \\\\( Tz(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} K(t, s) z(t) \\, dt \\).\n\nIf an intervention introduces a frequency shift by applying a function \\\\( g(t) = e^{i\\Omega t} \\\\) midway during the transformation, will the final output \\\\( Tz(s) \\\\) reflect only the new frequency \\\\( \\Omega \\\\) and not \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new function \\\\( g(t) = e^{i\\Omega t} \\\\) introduced as an intervention modifies the existing state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), and both frequencies \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\Omega \\\\) could potentially influence the final transformed output due to the overlapping effects and the inherent properties of the Gaussian kernel, which does not selectively filter out specific frequencies cleanly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The input function z(t) is transformed into Tz(s) via the integral transformation T. Introducing g(t) midway changes the transformation such that Tz(s) reflects primarily the frequency Ω from g(t) rather than the original frequency ω from z(t)."
