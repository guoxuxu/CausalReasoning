  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a differential operator. We examine the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the system, which alters the representation to depend on frequency variables \\\\( \\omega \\\\).\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new operator \\\\( M \\\\) is applied post-Fourier transform as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be exclusively determined by \\\\( L \\\\), regardless of \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with operator \\\\( M \\\\) will modify the transformed state during its evolution. Therefore, the final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) will reflect the influences of both \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\), not just \\\\( L \\\\). The impact of \\\\( M \\\\) can alter the trajectory even in the Fourier transformed domain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying operator L directly influences the state u(t) over time. Applying operator M after the Fourier transform influences u(t) up to t_1, but does not affect u(T) for T > t_1 because the system evolves according to L thereafter."
