  "Problem": "Consider a function system described by the complex function \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a complex constant. This system undergoes an integral transformation defined by \\\\( I(w) = \\\\int w(z) dz \\\\) applied over a certain path in the complex plane.\n\nGiven the outcome of the integral transformation \\\\( I(w) \\\\), can we determine the original function \\\\( w(z) \\\\) used (i.e., recover \\\\( A \\\\)) without additional information on path or conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The result of the integral transformation alone, without the specifics of the path or boundary conditions, cannot uniquely identify the coefficient \\\\( A \\\\) in the function \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\). Different values of A may yield similar results depending on the integration path and limiting behavior.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
