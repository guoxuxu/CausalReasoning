  "Problem": "Consider a system based on the function \\\\( z(x) = e^{Ax} \\\\), where A is a complex matrix and \\\\( x \\\\) is a real scalar. We evaluate the effect of applying a transformation \\\\( h(z) = Bz \\\\), where B is also a complex matrix, on the variable \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention by applying a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = Cz \\\\) (where C is another complex matrix) is introduced at some x = X1, will the outcome state \\\\( z(X) \\\\) at X > X1 depend only on A and not on B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome \\\\( z(X) \\\\) will depend on the interplay of A, B, and C due to the sequential application of transformations and their potential non-commutative nature. The system's evolution is affected by both the initial transformation with B and the intervention with C, making the final state \\\\( z(X) \\\\) a function of A, B, and C.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation g(z) = Cz at x = X1 will directly cause z(X) for X > X1, while the original transformation h(z) = Bz does not affect this relationship. Thus, z(X) depends on A through the initial condition and C through the intervening transformation."
