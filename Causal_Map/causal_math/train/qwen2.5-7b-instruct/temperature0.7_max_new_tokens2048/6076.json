  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), and its behavior under the integral transformation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where s is a complex parameter.\n\nCan we ascertain whether the original function or the modified function (post-intervention) was applied, merely by analyzing \\\\( T[g](s) \\\\) after the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Given the nature of the transformation and the possibility of different function forms like \\\\( e^{z} \\\\) or \\\\( e^{z^2} \\\\) leading to diverse results under the same transformation parameter s, it’s challenging to uniquely determine the pre-transformation function form purely based on \\\\( T[g](s) \\\\). Multiple function forms could yield complex behavior after transformation, increasing uncertainty without additional data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The original function f(z) → T[f](s) transforms into T[f](s) through the integral transformation, and similarly, the original function g(z) → T[g](s) transforms into T[g](s] through the same process."
