  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant and \\( t \\) represents time. The system undergoes a Fourier transformation defined by \\( \\hat{z}(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt \\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform result as \\( \\delta(\\omega - \\omega') \\), can we specify whether any modulation like \\( e^{-i\\alpha t} \\) was applied solely based on the delta function's position?",
  "Explanation": "The delta function indicates the presence of a pure frequency, but it cannot reveal if this frequency resulted directly from \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\) or from a modified function such as \\( e^{i(\\omega - \\alpha)t} \\). The centrality of \\( \\omega' \\) matches \\( \\omega - \\alpha \\) and could be interpreted as either the original or shifted frequency without additional context.",
