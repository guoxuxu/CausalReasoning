  "Problem": "Consider a complex integral transformation defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{C} \\\\frac{e^{zt}}{(z-a)^2} dz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a contour in the complex plane encompassing the singularity at \\\\( z = a \\\\). Analyze how the transformation's effect varies due to perturbing the path \\\\( C \\\\) or modifying the exponential term's coefficient.\n\nIf the path \\\\( C \\\\) is slightly varied without crossing or touching the singular point \\\\( a \\\\), will the transformed result \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at a later parameter \\\\( t \\\\) remain unchanged?",
  "Explanation": "As long as the contour \\\\( C \\\\) still encompasses the singularity at \\\\( z = a \\\\) without crossing it, the result of the integral transformation defined by the Residue Theorem remains unchanged. The integral's value is dictated by the singularities enclosed by the contour, not by its specific shape as long as topological conditions are met.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Varying the path C slightly without crossing or touching the singular point a does not change F(z) at a later parameter t, and increasing t increases the magnitude of the exponential term in the integrand."
