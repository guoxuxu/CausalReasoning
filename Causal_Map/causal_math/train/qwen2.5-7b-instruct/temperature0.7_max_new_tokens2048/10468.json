  "Problem": "We consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We explore scenarios involving the integral transform \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant, to analyze how transformations and interventions affect the system.\n\nGiven the transformed endpoint \\\\( F(z(T)) \\\\), can we unambiguously determine if any interventions (like scaling by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)) were applied, just from the transformed value?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the precise nature or existence of interventions such as scaling solely from the endpoint \\\\( F(z(T)) \\\\) is not feasible. The integration and transformation process may mask or mimic the effects of interventions, making it impossible to precisely deduce the type or presence of scaling or other alterations made during the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The complex-valued function z(t) directly influences its derivative dz/dt, and through z(t) also influences the integral transform F(z). Scaling z(t) by α directly influences z(t), which in turn affects F(z). The constant ω directly causes dz/dt, while the constant s directly influences F(z)."
