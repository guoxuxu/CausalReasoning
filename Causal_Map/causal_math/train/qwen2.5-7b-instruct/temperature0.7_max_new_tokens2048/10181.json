  "Problem": "Consider the impact of different transform kernels in an integral transformation on a function \\\\( f(x) \\\\). Define transform kernels \\\\( K(t, x) = e^{At} \\\\) and intervention kernels \\\\( L(t, x) = e^{Bt} \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices, on the analysis of the function over time.\n\nIf the kernel \\\\( K(t, x) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( f(x) \\\\) at t = 0, and the function is allowed to evolve under this kernel without further intervention, will the function at t = T be the same as if no kernel was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the kernel \\\\( K(t, x) = e^{At} \\\\) modifies the function by operating through a convolution-type transformation, fundamentally altering its characteristics and trajectory over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying transform kernel K(t, x) to f(x) at t=0 influences f(T), while no kernel application leaves f(x) unchanged, thus f(T) under K(t, x) is different from f(T) without any kernel."
