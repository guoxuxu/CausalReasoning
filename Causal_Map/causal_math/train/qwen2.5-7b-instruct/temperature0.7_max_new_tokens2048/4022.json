  "Problem": "Assume the function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the complex differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\) where \\( \\omega \\) is a real number, represents a physical process. We explore the effects of the operation \\( h(z) = e^{kt}z \\) on \\( z(t) \\), with \\( k \\) being another real constant.\n\nCan we infer the initial condition \\( z_0 \\) accurately after observing \\( z(T) \\) when unsure if the operation \\( h(z) \\) was applied during the period, only from the equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without confirmation of the application of \\( h(z) \\) and merely observing \\( z(T) \\), there is ambiguity since multiple initial conditions could evolve into the same \\( z(T) \\) due to the multiplication by \\( e^{kT} \\). This makes it impossible to ascertain \\( z_0 \\) uniquely.",
