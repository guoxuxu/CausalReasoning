  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) defined in the complex plane as \\\\( h(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\), and its transformation through the integral \\\\( H(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} h(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable. We examine the behavior when using two transformations: \\\\( f(t) = t^2 \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) = \\\\sin(t) \\\\).\n\nAfter obtaining \\\\( H(s) \\\\) from \\\\( h(t) \\\\), is it possible to accurately determine whether the transformation \\\\( f(t) = t^2 \\\\) was applied to \\\\( h(t) \\\\) before taking the integral, based on the resulting \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without previous knowledge of whether \\\\( f(t) \\\\) was applied, it’s challenging to infer the transformation directly from \\\\( H(s) \\\\) due to the potential alterations in the integral caused by the transformation, particularly if the effects of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) result in a function outside the typical properties of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) derived from \\\\( h(t) \\\\).",
