  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( z(x) = \\int_0^x e^{t^2} dt \\\\). We explore the behavior of the function under different transformations and integration conditions.\n\nIf a linear transformation \\\\( h(x) = ax + b \\\\) (where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are constants) is applied before computing \\\\( z(x) \\\\), will the result of \\\\( z(h(x)) \\\\) only depend on x and not on the coefficients of h?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation affects the variable passed to \\\\( z \\\\). This means the integration limits and the function form integrate over a different range and a modified argument, respectively. As such, the outcomes will indeed depend on the parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) of \\\\( h \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
