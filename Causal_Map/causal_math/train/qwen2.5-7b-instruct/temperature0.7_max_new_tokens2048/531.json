  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = h(t) + g(t)i \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\) are real functions representing harmonic oscillations. We analyze the impact of a Fourier transform on this complex function over time t.\n\nIf an intervention in the form of a differential operator \\\\( D = \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\) is applied at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), affecting \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from that point onwards, will the Fourier transform at T > t_1 reflect only the original characteristics of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of a differential operator as an intervention modifies the frequency components of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by shifting their frequencies and potentially changing their amplitudes. Thus, the Fourier transform at any time T > t_1 will reflect the effects of both the initial conditions and the intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "A differential operator D applied to h(t) and g(t) results in their derivatives h'(t) and g'(t), which then affect z'(t). The derivative z'(t) influences the value of z(t) at any time t. Applying D at t_1 changes z(t) starting from t_1, and this change propagates through z'(t) to Z(T) for T > t_1."
