  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) in a domain \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\). If \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) is a solution, then we apply a transformation by adding a complex function \\\\(g(z)\\\\) where \\\\(z = x + iy\\\\) and examine changes in the boundary behavior.\n\nGiven the boundary conditions of \\\\(u\\\\) at a time t = T, can the parameters k and the exact form of \\\\(g(z)\\\\) be uniquely determined?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of k and different forms of \\\\(g(z)\\\\) could result in the same boundary behavior at t = T, especially considering the complex interactions and the infinite possibilities for the choice of \\\\(g\\\\). Therefore, it is impossible to uniquely determine k and \\\\(g\\\\) simply based on the observed boundary conditions at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
