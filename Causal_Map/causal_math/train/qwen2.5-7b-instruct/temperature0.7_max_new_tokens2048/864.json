  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\) defined in the complex plane where \\\\( x, y \\\\) are real numbers and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex function. We apply the Laplace transform to the function, which changes its domain from time-domain to frequency-domain, represented as \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t)) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nKnowing the transformed function \\\\( F(s) \\\\) post-intervention that included additional dependencies (*e.g.*, \\\\( g(y) \\\\)), can we establish precisely what the form of intervention was based solely on \\\\( F(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific form of an intervention such as \\\\( g(y) \\\\) just from \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is not feasible, as multiple differing forms of \\\\( g(y) \\\\) could result in the same or similar transformations in \\\\( F(s) \\\\). The resulting transformed function may not uniquely specify the nature or structure of the intervention applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
