  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the time-dependent differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Ay \\\\), where A is a constant matrix. We are interested in testing the effects of applying a complex integral transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Bt}z(t) dt \\\\), where B is also a constant matrix, on this system.\n\nIf we apply \\\\( f(z) \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from t = 0 to T and let the system evolve with the original differential equations without applying any further transformations, will the state of the system at a later time T' > T be the same as if no transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) integrates the function \\\\( e^{Bt}z(t) \\\\), which modifies the spectrum of initial conditions imposed on the subsequent evolution of the system. This change in the initial trajectory due to the integral transformation can alter the state at any later time T' > T.",
