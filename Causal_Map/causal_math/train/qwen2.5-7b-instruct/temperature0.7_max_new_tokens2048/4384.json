  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + kz^2\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency, and \\\\(k\\\\) is a complex constant. We analyze the effect of a linear transformation \\\\( h(z) = Cz \\\\) applied at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a nonzero complex constant.\n\nGiven the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which interventions were used (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( j(z) \\\\), or both) and their parameters only by knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the nonlinear nature of the governing equation and the further complication of compound transformations \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( j(z) \\\\), it is challenging to backtrack and uniquely determine the sequence or scale of interventions solely based on the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Different parameters and their combinations can lead to equivalent end states due to overlapping effect.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of z with respect to time (z'(t)) directly influences the value of z at a future time step (z(t+Δt)). Applying a linear transformation h(z) directly changes the value of z at time t. Without additional information about the application of j(z) or specific details about the transformations and initial conditions, it is not possible to precisely determine which interventions were used and their parameters solely based on the end state z(T)."
