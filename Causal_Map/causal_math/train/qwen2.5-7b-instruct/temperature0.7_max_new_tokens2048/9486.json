  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial state of the system. The effect of the integral transformation described by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{B\\\\tau} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) is analyzed with respect to its impact on \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nCan we infer the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) given the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) if we do not know whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) had been applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "The potential application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) complicates backtracking to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) as it entails an integration process influenced by \\\\( B \\\\), which impacts the trajectory in a non-trivial way, obscuring the original state.",
