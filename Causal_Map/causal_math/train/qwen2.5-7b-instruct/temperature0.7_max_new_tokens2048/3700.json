  "Problem": "In this scenario, we consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), where \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). This scenario investigates how the causal relationship between functions and their transforms behaves with or without interventions in the form of function modification.\n\nGiven that \\\\( H(s) = F(s-a) + \\\\frac{c}{s-a} \\\\), is it possible to determine precisely whether the function was originally \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without knowing both the intervention \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) and the modification of adding \\\\( c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The measured Laplace transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\) integrates the effects of both the exponential intervention and the additive constant. Without explicit knowledge of one or both interventions, it is impossible to accurately reverse-engineer \\\\( f(t) \\\\) alone, as similar outcomes could arise under different specific modifications.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
