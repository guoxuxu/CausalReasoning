  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) defined on the complex plane. We evaluate the responses to integrations involving the complex function and the related impacts given by the transform \\\\( g(z) = e^{2\\\\pi iz} \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and allowed to evolve without further modification, will the result of \\\\( f(z(t)) \\\\) at t = 1 be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly transformed by \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at t = 1?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) squares the complex number, changing both magnitude and argument differently than the transform \\\\( g(z) = e^{2\\\\pi iz} \\\\), which rotates the number in the complex plane without altering the magnitude. Thus, the results at t = 1 are fundamentally different.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of f(z(t)) at t=1 depends on the evolution of z_0 over time, while g(z_0) at t=1 directly transforms z_0. Since z(t) and f(z(t)) are derived from z_0 through different processes, f(z(t)) at t=1 will not necessarily be the same as g(z_0) at t=1."
