  "Problem": "Examine the effect of a Fourier transformation denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) defined on the real line. Further, let's consider that \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is initially described by a differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}g(t) = -\\lambda g(t) \\\\) where \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) is a positive real number. The Fourier transform is then impacted by an additional transformation \\\\( h(f) = e^{-\\alpha |f|^2} \\\\), where \\\\( f \\\\) represents frequency and \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nConsidering the final observed output \\\\( |\\\\mathcal{F}[g](f, T)| \\\\), can we precisely determine both the original exponential decay rate \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) and the parameters of \\\\( h(f) = e^{-\\alpha |f|^2} \\\\) solely based on the output data at time T?",
  "Explanation": "Due to superposition and interaction effects in the Fourier transform and additional modifications by \\\\( h(f) \\\\), it is not feasible to uniquely identify and separate both \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) and \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) values just by observing the output spectrum at T. This ambiguity harps on the overlapping influences each parameter has on the frequency domain.",
