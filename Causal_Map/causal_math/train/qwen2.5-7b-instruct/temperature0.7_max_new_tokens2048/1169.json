  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) where \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) are real functions describing a physical system. We investigate a transformation \\( f(z) = e^{i\\omega t}z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant frequency, applied to this system over time \\( t \\).\n\nIf \\( f(z) \\) is applied to a complex number \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve according to the dynamics \\( \\dot{z} = \\lambda z \\), where \\( \\lambda \\) is a complex constant, will \\( z(t) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( z_0 \\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\( \\dot{z} = \\lambda z \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\( f(z) \\) modifies the initial state of the system, imparting a rotational component due to the term \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\). This leads to a trajectory that differs fundamentally from that which arises from the direct integration of \\( \\dot{z} = \\lambda z \\). The resultant state at time T depends not only on the initial condition \\( z_0 \\) but also significantly on the parameter \\( \\omega \\).",
