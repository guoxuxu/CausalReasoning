  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system described by \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where A is a real constant, C is a complex constant matrix, and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex vector. We examine the impact of transformation \\\\( h(z) = De^{iBt}z \\\\) over time t, where D is a complex constant matrix and B is another real constant.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{iAt}z_0 \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to T under \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{iAt}z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) changes the initial state by the transformation \\\\( De^{iB0}z_0 = Dz_0 \\\\. The matrix D can lead to an eigenvalue scaling or a rotation, depending on its structure, which modifies the overall evolution making \\\\( z(T) \\\\) different from the state arrived by just evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\( Ce^{iAt} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation h(z) applied at t=0 and then allowed to evolve under z(t) = Ce^(iAt)z_0 will result in z(T) being the same as if z_0 was directly evolved to T under z(t) = Ce^(iAt)z_0, because the effect of h(z) is only at t=0 and does not alter the subsequent evolution governed by z(t)."
