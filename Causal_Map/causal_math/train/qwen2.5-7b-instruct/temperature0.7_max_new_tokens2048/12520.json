  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) in which both x and y are differentiable real-valued functions of t. We apply a transformation \\\\( w(z) = e^{iAt}z \\\\) where A is a constant real number and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit.\n\nIf \\\\( w(z) \\\\) is applied to an initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then permitted to evolve under the operation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = az \\\\) without further manipulation, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) evolving under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = az \\\\) to time T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( w(z) \\\\) modifies the initial phase and amplitude of \\\\( z_0 \\\\), impacting how it evolves under the differential operation. Since \\\\( e^{iAt} \\\\) adjusts the phase of the complex number, the resulting trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) will differ.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation w(z) at t=0 with initial condition z_0 results in z(t), which evolves under the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = az \\) to become z(T) at time T, assuming no further manipulation is applied."
