  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in complex domain as \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) and a mapping function given by \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\). We explore the impact of their composition \\\\( h(z) = g(f(z)) \\\\) and transformations related to the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\), where C is a contour in the complex plane.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is defined as described above, and the contour C is altered from a circular path around the origin to a rectangular path, will the result of \\\\( \\\\int_C f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\) still represent a function solely dependent on the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral \\\\( \\\\int_C f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\), where \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\), is highly sensitive to the path of C due to residues and poles in the complex plane. Changing the contour shape impacts whether the pole at z=0 is enclosed, fundamentally altering the result of the integral.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
