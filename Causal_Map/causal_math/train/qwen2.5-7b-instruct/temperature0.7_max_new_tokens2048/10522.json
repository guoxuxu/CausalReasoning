  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. This function models a sinusoidal signal in the complex plane over time \\\\( t \\\\). Additionally, analyze the impact of a Laplace transform applied to this function, transforming it into \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), and its implications on causality inferences.\n\nIs it possible to uniquely determine \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) from the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), given that no other information about the time evolution or the initial conditions is known?",
  "Explanation": "Given the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) can be uniquely extracted as the imaginary part of the pole of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\). This characteristic holds independently of initial conditions or specific system evolution.",
