  "Problem": "Consider a functional transformation in a complex plane defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\). Analyze the evolution of values under the transformation and its implications with and without external interventions.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without further modifications, will the transformed value \\\\( f(z_0) \\\\) maintain the same magnitude as \\\\( z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The magnitude of \\\\( e^{iz_0} \\\\) in the complex plane is always 1, regardless of the value of \\\\( z_0 \\\\), as the exponential of a pure imaginary number \\\\( iz_0 \\\\) translates to rotation on the unit circle in the complex plane, not affecting the magnitude.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The magnitude of z_0 directly influences the magnitude of f(z_0); applying f(z) to z_0 maintains the magnitude of z_0."
