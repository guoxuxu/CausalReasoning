  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Mx + Nu \\), where \\( M \\) and \\( N \\) are constant matrices, and \\( u(t) \\) is a control function. We explore the impact of a transformation \\( f(x) = Sx \\), where \\( S \\) is a linear invertible matrix applied instantaneously at a certain time.\n\nIf an intervention \\( g(x) = Dx \\) (where \\( D \\) is another constant matrix) is applied at a time \\( t_1 \\), will the system's state \\( x(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depend solely on the properties of \\( M \\) and not on \\( S \\) or \\( D \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the transformation \\( g(x) \\) as \\( Dx \\) at \\( t_1 \\) adds another layer of complexity to the system's dynamics. The final state \\( x(T) \\) will now depend on \\( S \\), \\( D \\), and \\( M \\). Since these matrices may not commute and can interact in complex ways, the final state is influenced by all transformations along with control dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An intervention g(x) = Dx directly causes changes in x, while M governs the continuous evolution of x over time. The instantaneous transformation f(x) = Sx does not affect the long-term behavior of x for T > t1, and thus x(T) depends on M but not on S or D."
