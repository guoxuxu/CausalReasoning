  "Problem": "Consider a system involving a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are functions governed by linear differential equations, and i represents the imaginary unit. The transformation applied is \\\\( f(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), where B is a real constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to an initial complex value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to develop under the respective differential equations for x and y without further intervention, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was evolved under the original equations to time T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) rotates the initial complex plane vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\), changing its trajectory. Since \\\\( e^{iBt} \\\\) effectively rotates by an angle \\\\( Bt \\\\), the resulting trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) will be different from the untransformed path.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation f(z) directly changes the state of z(t), which is composed of x(t) and y(t). The constant B directly influences the form of the transformation f(z). Without further intervention, the evolution of x(t) and y(t) under their respective differential equations determines the state z(t) at any time T."
