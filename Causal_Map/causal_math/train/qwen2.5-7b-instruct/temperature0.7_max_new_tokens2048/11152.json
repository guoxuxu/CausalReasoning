  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and i is the imaginary unit. We explore the effect of a transformation, defined by the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), over time t, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the manifestation of \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we exactly determine what transformations and sequences were applied (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both), solely based on the knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining specific interventions from the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is highly ambiguous due to the overlapping influences of the transformations and the inherent complexities of exponentiation with complex numbers. Precisely identifying the sequence or type of transformations based on the endpoint is generally unfeasible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
