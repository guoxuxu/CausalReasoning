  "Problem": "Consider a complex function given by \\\\( z(t) = e^{At} + i \\\\int_0^t e^{(A-1)s} ds \\\\), where A is a constant and i represents the imaginary unit. We analyze the behavior of z when affected by transformation \\( g(t, z) = e^{Bt} z \\), where B is another constant.\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) an additional transformation \\\\( h(t, z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) (where C is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced only by A and not by B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(t, z) \\\\) adds another layer of complexity to the function's evolution, affecting the trajectory and the endpoint. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is influenced by all three constants A, B, and C, since the transformations introduce scaling and rotation effects at different stages of the function's evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
