  "Problem": "Investigate the effects of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where \\\\( t \\\\) is time, on a real variable system \\\\( x(t) = t^2 \\\\) under both normal evolution and perturbed conditions.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is only observed without altering the evolution of \\\\( x(t) \\\\), will the knowledge of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) influence the trajectory of \\\\( x(t) = t^2 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) is complex and oscillates on the unit circle in the complex plane, whereas \\\\( x(t) = t^2 \\\\) is solely dependent on real values of \\\\( t \\\\) and progresses independently of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Therefore, observing or not observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) does not affect the trajectory of \\\\( x(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z(t) does not directly influence the trajectory of x(t) = t^2 since z(t) is only observed and not used to alter the evolution of x(t)."
