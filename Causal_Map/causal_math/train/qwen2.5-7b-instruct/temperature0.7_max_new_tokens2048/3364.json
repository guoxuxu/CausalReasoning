  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. We examine the impact of applying a linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = cz + d \\\\) where \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\) are complex constants, on the function \\\\( f \\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( f(Z) \\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations were used (whether \\\\( T(z), S(z), \\\\) or both), solely by knowing the value of \\\\( f(Z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the multitude of possibilities for choosing parameters \\\\( c, d, e, f \\\\) leading to potentially equivalent outputs of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it is impossible to uniquely determine which transformations or their combination were applied merely from the final function value. Each set of parameters can induce variations that result in the same \\\\( f(Z) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying a linear transformation T(z) or S(z) to z can result in a specific value for f(Z), but knowing only f(Z) does not uniquely determine which transformations were applied."
