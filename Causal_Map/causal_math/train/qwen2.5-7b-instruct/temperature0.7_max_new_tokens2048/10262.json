  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) mapping real numbers to complex numbers. We explore the transformation driven by the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), applied to this function resulting in \\\\(Z(\\\\omega)\\\\), and analyze its impact under different conditions.\n\nCan the original function \\\\(x(t)\\\\) be uniquely determined from \\\\(Z(\\\\omega)\\\\) if the scaling parameter \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is unknown?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the scaling parameter \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\), it is impossible to accurately reverse the frequency shift introduced by the exponential factor in \\\\(z(t)\\\\), thus making it challenging to uniquely recover the original function \\\\(x(t)\\\\) from \\\\(Z(\\\\omega)\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
