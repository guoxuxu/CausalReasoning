  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) that represents a complex function on the complex plane, given by \\\\( z(x) = e^{ix} \\\\). For a complex domain transformation defined by \\\\( w(z) = z^2 \\\\), we investigate how this affects the mapping of points over an interval from x = 0 to x = 2\\\\pi.\n\nGiven a mapped point \\\\( w \\\\) on the w-plane at x = \\\\pi, can we unambiguously determine the corresponding value of x on the z-plane without knowing whether the transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given a point \\\\( w \\\\) at any part of the evolution (say x = \\\\pi), the original x on the z-plane could correspond to multiple values due to the squaring transformation (i.e., both x and x+\\\\pi would map to the same w). Without knowing the specifics of the transformation, multiple possible pre-images exist.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation w(z) = z^2 maps each z to w, and z(x) = e^(ix) maps x to z. Knowing w at x = π does not uniquely determine x in z because w(π) = w(3π) = -1 due to the periodicity of the exponential function."
