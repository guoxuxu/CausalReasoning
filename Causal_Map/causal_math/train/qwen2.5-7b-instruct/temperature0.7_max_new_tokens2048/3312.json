  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iz\\\\), and an integral transformation \\\\(T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{s^2} z(s) ds\\\\). We investigate how the results of further transformations and initial conditions evolve through the system.\n\nGiven the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at a time T, can we conclusively identify which transformations (either \\\\(T(z)\\\\), \\\\(G(z)\\\\), or both) were applied, solely from the knowledge of \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The combination of different integral transformations along with the original evolution under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iz\\\\) results in overlapping effects that cannot be unambiguously disaggregated at the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\). This overlap makes it impossible to uniquely pinpoint which transformations affected the pathway of the function z.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
