  "Problem": "Consider a system of coupled harmonic oscillators whose state is described by the vector function \\\\(\\\\vec{z}(t)\\\\). The evolution over time is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{\\\\vec{z}} = M\\\\vec{z}\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We investigate the system's behavior under the Fourier transform, defined as \\\\( F(\\\\vec{z})(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\omega t}\\\\vec{z}(t) dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( \\\\vec{z}(T) \\\\), can we uniquely determine whether the original state underwent the Fourier transform, the transformation \\\\( G(\\\\vec{z}) \\\\), or both from just knowing \\\\( \\\\vec{z}(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact sequence or type of transformations from the endpoint \\\\( \\\\vec{z}(T) \\\\) is not feasible due to the convolutive effects of matrix transformations on the spectral and time-domain properties of the state vector. Multiple transformation paths could lead to identical or indistinguishable endpoints.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
