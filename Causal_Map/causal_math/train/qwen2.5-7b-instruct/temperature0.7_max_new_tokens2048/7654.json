  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( g(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\) defined over complex numbers, and its transformation over time t using \\\\( T(p(z)) = \\\\int_0^t e^{z^2} dz \\\\).\n\nBy observing the value of \\\\( T(p(z)) \\\\) at \\( t = T \\), can we uniquely determine \\\\( g(z_0) \\) without knowing the specific path taken over \\( t \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation by integration adds complexity, and different initial values of \\( z \\) could result in the same integral value at \\( t = T \\) due to the properties of complex function behavior and integration, making it impossible to reverse uniquely.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
