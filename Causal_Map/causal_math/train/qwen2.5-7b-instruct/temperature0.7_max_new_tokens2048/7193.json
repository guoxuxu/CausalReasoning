  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. We investigate the impact of applying a Fourier transform, represented by the function \\\\( F(u) \\\\), to the function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) and how this affects the behavior over time.\n\nIf \\\\( F(u) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) initially and then \\\\( u \\\\) is evolved according to \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at T = T be impacted by the initial application of \\\\( F(u) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform to \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) alters the initial conditions by converting it into the frequency domain. This transformation influences how the solution evolves under the operator \\\\( L \\\\), as the effects of \\\\( L \\\\) on the transformed \\\\( u \\\\) might differ significantly from its effect on the original, potentially altering dynamics and solutions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
