  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) which solves the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = a^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a positive constant. An integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is applied, defined by \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-sx} u(x, t) \\\\, dx \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\( T(u)(T) \\\\), can we determine exactly which differential operator \\\\( D \\\\) was applied during the intervention at some \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), based purely on this information?",
  "Explanation": "The final transformed state \\\\( T(u)(T) \\\\) under the heat equation could be influenced by various forms of the differential operator \\\\( D \\\\), which differentially affect the evolution of \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\). The lack of unique determination from the end result to the specific intervention reflects the non-injective nature of such transformations under differential and integral modifications.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function u(x, t) is transformed into T(u)(T) through the integral transformation T. The application of a differential operator D at time t_1 < T influences the form of u(x, t) but cannot be uniquely determined from T(u)(T) alone."
