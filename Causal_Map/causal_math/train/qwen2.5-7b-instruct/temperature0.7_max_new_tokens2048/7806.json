  "Problem": "Consider a complex function transformation of a vector space, where we use the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) defined by the operation \\\\( L(z) = pz + q \\\\) for complex scalars \\\\( p \\\\) and \\\\( q \\\\). We investigate how the transformation impacts the solutions of the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant matrix, over time t.\n\nCan we determine the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after it evolved under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), not knowing if transformation \\\\( L(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Unless exact details of the transformation (values of \\\\( p \\\\) and \\\\( q \\\\)) are known, reversing the transformations or differential equation effects to deduce \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is indeterminable. The transformation \\\\( pz + q \\\\) can potentially modify \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in ways that are not simply reversible without additional information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The solution of the differential equation Mz → dz/dt determines the evolution of z over time, starting from z0 → z(t), which eventually leads to z(T). Applying the transformation L(z) → z' does not affect the determination of z0 from z(T) since the original z0 can be traced back through z(t) → z(T)."
