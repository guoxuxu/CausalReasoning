  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) representing a complex-valued signal over time. The function is transformed by a Fourier transform, represented as \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\). We analyze causal inference when altering the frequency spectrum by filtering specific frequency components.\n\nAfter observing a time-domain signal \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) obtained from an inverse Fourier transform of a filtered spectrum, can we perfectly reconstruct the unaltered original signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without prior knowledge of the applied filter?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the details of the frequency components removed by the filter, it is impossible to accurately reconstruct the original signal since the high-frequency details lost during filtering are irreplaceable. Hence, perfect reconstruction of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from the altered \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) is not feasible.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The original time-domain signal z(t) influences the observed time-domain signal z'(t) through its Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega)\\\\), which is then filtered to produce a modified frequency spectrum \\\\(\\\\hat{z}'(\\\\omega)\\\\), and finally transformed back to the time domain to yield z'(t).
