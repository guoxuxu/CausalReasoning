  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real-valued functions of time t, satisfying the Cauchy-Riemann equations. \\nWe investigate how the transformation \\\\(g(z) = e^{wt}z\\\\), where w is a complex constant, affects this function over time.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(g(z)\\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0, and then \\\\(z(t)\\\\) evolves under the original complex function without further intervention, will \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\(z_0\\\\) was just evolved under the original complex function to T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation alters the initial condition by scaling and possibly rotating it depending on the real and imaginary parts of w. This initial change modifies the trajectory of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) because the transformation and the evolution under the complex function do not necessarily commute.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation g(z) applied to z_0 at t=0 results in z(T), which is different from evolving z_0 directly to z(T) under the original function because g(z) introduces exponential growth/decay based on the complex constant w."
