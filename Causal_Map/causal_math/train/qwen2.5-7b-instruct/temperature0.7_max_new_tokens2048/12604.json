  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( z' = Cz \\\\), where C is a linear operator. We evaluate the effect of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = S^{-1}e^{Dt}Sz \\\\), where D is a linear operator and S is an invertible matrix, over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z' = Cz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( z' = Cz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) adjusts the initial condition via the operator \\\\( S^{-1}e^{Dt}S \\\\) which rescales and rotates the vector, thus altering the trajectory. Consequently, the state at time T will differ due to these changes, unless D and C are related in such a way that their exponentials commute over time through S.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation h(z) to z_0 at t=0 and allowing it to evolve under z' = Cz until t=T results in the same z(t) as directly evolving z_0 under z' = Cz from t=0 to t=T."
