  "Problem": "Investigate a system where current flows through an electrical circuit influenced by a complex function transform. The current \\( I(t) \\) is governed by \\( \\dot{I} = -RI + V_0 \\) where \\( R \\) is resistance and \\( V_0 \\) a voltage source. We explore the behavior under the Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{I(t)\\} \\) and its inverse.\n\nIf an additional voltage \\( V_1 e^{-Rt} \\) is introduced at a time \\( t_1 \\) and we apply the Laplace Transform, will the future behavior of \\( I(t) \\) at \\( t > t_1 \\) depend only on \\( R \\) and \\( V_0 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( V_1 e^{-Rt} \\) introduces a new component that alters the system's response. Both the original setup and the additional voltage \\( V_1 e^{-Rt} \\) contribute to the resultant \\( I(t) \\), which means future behavior depends on \\( R \\), \\( V_0 \\), and \\( V_1 \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "V_0 → I(t); R → I(t); V_1 e^{-Rt} → I(t); t_1 → I(t)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Resistance R and voltage V_0 directly cause the current I(t). An additional voltage V_1 e^{-Rt} and a time t_1 can also influence I(t) after t_1."
