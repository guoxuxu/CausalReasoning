  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. We study the effect of this transformation on the integral paths in the complex plane, specifically focusing on the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C e^{az} dz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) represents a path in the complex plane.\n\nBased on the integral output \\\\( \\\\int_C e^{az} dz \\\\), can one deduce the exact original path \\\\( C \\\\) if only the integral value is known?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple paths might result in the same integral value due to the properties of the complex exponential function over different paths. The integral value alone is insufficient to uniquely identify the original path without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
