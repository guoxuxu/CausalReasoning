  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions satisfying the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\). An integral transform \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int e^{st}z(t) dt \\\\) is applied where s is a complex number.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which interventions (specific values of k) were used only by knowing the final transformed value?",
  "Explanation": "The transform \\\\( T(z) \\\\) creates a scenario where multiple interventions leading to the same or similar transformed output at time T are possible. Different combinations of k and initial conditions can lead to outputs that are indistinguishable in the transform space, especially given the linear nature of differential influence.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The values of A, B, C, and D in the differential equations directly influence the behavior of x(t) and y(t), which in turn affect the integral transform T(z)(t)."
