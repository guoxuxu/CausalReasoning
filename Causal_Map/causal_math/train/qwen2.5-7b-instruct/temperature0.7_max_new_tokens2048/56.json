  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(f(z) = z^2 + 1\\\\) and its impact on a contour integral over a closed path in the complex plane. Analyze how the transformation \\\\(g(z) = z + ai\\\\) (where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit) affects the evaluation of the integral \\\\(\\\\oint_C f(z) \\\\, dz\\\\) around a simple closed contour \\\\(C\\\\).\n\nCan the exact transformations (\\\\(g(z)\\\\), \\\\(h(z)\\\\), or their combination) be determined from merely knowing the final contour \\\\(C''\\\\) and the value of the integral \\\\(\\\\oint_{C''} f(z) \\\\, dz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the exact sequence or type of transformations used to modify the contour based solely on the final position of the contour and the integral value is not feasible. The same final integral value and contour shape can be achieved through different paths or transformations, especially considering different choices of constants \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) and how they influence the movement in the complex plane.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation g(z) maps the initial contour C' to the intermediate contour C', which is then transformed to the final contour C''. The function f(z) evaluated along the contour C yields the integral ∮_C f(z) dz, and this integral's value when evaluated along the final contour C'' is ∮_{C''} f(z) dz."
