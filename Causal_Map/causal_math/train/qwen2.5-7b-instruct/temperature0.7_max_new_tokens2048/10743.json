  "Problem": "Consider the effect of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) on a time-dependent signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant. This leads to a transformed signal \\\\( y(t) = z(t) \\cdot x(t) \\\\). The operation is analyzed in the context of the Laplace transform domain, where both functions are transformed and then manipulated algebraically.\n\nAssuming an intervention changes \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and applies a new factor \\\\( w(t) = e^{i\\eta t} \\\\), will the intervention noticeably alter the form of \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) compared to the original transformation using only \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a new complex exponential \\\\( w(t) \\\\) as an intervention will effectively change the frequency shifting originally provided by \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The resultant signal would then undergo a different shift in frequency, conclusively altering the Laplace transform \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) from its initial form seen just with \\\\( z(t) \\\\). This modification directly depends on the properties and value of \\\\( \\eta \\\\) compared to \\\\( \\omega \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The change from z(t) to w(t) alters Y(s) because the Laplace transform of the product with x(t) changes with the different frequency factors."
