  "Problem": "Consider a linear system modeled by the equation \\\\( u' = Du \\\\), where D is a linear operator acting on a vector space V. We explore the impact of applying a linear transformation, defined by the operator \\\\( T(u) = Evu \\\\), where E is a matrix and v is a scalar, and then examining the system's response over time.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a transformation \\\\( M(u) = Ku_1 \\\\) (where K is another matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on D and not on E or K?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces another variable into the system's evolution. Therefore, the final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) is dependent on E (from the initial transformation), K (from the intervention), and D (the system operator). Each contributes in shaping the trajectory and final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The final state u(T) at time T depends on the initial dynamics described by D and the interventions M and K. Specifically, M → u(T) indicates that the application of M at time t1 influences the state u(T), alongside the continuous effect of D."
