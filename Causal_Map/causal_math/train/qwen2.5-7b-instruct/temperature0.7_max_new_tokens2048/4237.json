  "Problem": "Consider a complex function given by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) which describes a point moving on the unit circle in the complex plane over time t. We explore the response of the system under an integral transformation described by \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t f(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is applied at t = 0 and simply integrated over time (without any additional transformation), will the result \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) describe a circular motion in the complex plane at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The integral of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) yields a function that accumulates values along a spiral path in the complex plane, rather than describing a simple circular motion. The integral inherently alters the nature of the trajectory as it provides a cumulative effect rather than a cyclic one.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
