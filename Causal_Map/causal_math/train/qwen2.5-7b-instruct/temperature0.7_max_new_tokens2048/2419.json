  "Problem": "Examine a control system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu + p\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator and \\\\(p\\\\) is a control function. The system's transformation is analyzed using the Laplace transform, defined as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(u(t)) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}u(t)\\\\, dt\\\\).\n\nIf a modified control function \\\\( q(t) = p(t) + e^{kt} \\\\) is used as an intervention at a time t = T, will the subsequent Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(u(t))\\\\) for t > T depend only on the new function q and not on the original p?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with function q alters the control from time T onward, but the state of the system u(t) at time T, which is influenced by the original p(t) up to T, also factors into the system's future evolution under q. The Laplace transform of u(t) for t > T reflects both the influence of p and q due to the system's history dependent nature.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The modified control function q(t) directly influences u(t) through its dependence on p(t) and the exponential term e^(kt). The introduction of q(t) at time T changes the dynamics of u(t), and thus the Laplace transform L(u(t)) for t > T depends on q(t) rather than the original p(t)."
