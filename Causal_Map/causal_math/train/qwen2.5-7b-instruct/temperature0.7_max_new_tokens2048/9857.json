  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant (LTI) system represented by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Dy\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. Evaluate the system's dynamics under different transformations and perturbations using scalar functions and the Laplace transform, represented as \\\\( f(y) = Ly \\\\) where L is a linear operator.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(y) \\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\( y_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and the system evolves under \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Dy\\\\) without further intervention, will the system's state \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( y_0 \\\\) were allowed to evolve directly under \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Dy\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( f(y) \\\\) modifies the initial conditions. The behavior of \\\\( Ly \\\\) influences how \\\\( y(t) \\\\) evolves depending on the properties of L relative to D. This can potentially change the trajectory, hence, the resulting state at time T will differ from the untransformed initial condition evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation f(y) to the initial condition y_0 changes the system's state y(t) over time, whereas allowing y_0 to evolve directly under D results in a different state y(t) at time t = T unless f(y) = identity."
