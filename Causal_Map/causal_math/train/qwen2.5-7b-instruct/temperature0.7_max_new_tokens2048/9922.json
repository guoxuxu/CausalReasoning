  "Problem": "Consider a wave equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\) defined in a one-dimensional space. We examine the effects of a Fourier transform applied to u(x,0) to analyze the wave's behavior.\n\nAfter observing the wave's behavior at a time t > 0, can we uniquely determine the initial wave function \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) from its Fourier transformed state \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t)\\\\) without additional data?",
  "Explanation": "Given the linear and reversible nature of the Fourier transform combined with the determinism of the wave equation, the initial condition \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, 0)\\\\) can be uniquely recovered by inverse Fourier transforming \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t)\\\\).",
