  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable \\\\( z \\\\) given by \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-sz} ds \\\\), which is an integral transformation. We assess the behavior and relationships of this function under different transformations \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nGiven a bounded value of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) after some transformations, can we conclusively identify the original \\\\( z \\\\) or the transformations applied?",
  "Explanation": "While transformations that increase the real part of \\\\( z \\\\) result in bounded \\\\( h(z) \\\\), the specific original value of \\\\( z \\\\) or the transformations made cannot be uniquely determined from the boundedness alone due to potential multiple transformations achieving the same effect.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
