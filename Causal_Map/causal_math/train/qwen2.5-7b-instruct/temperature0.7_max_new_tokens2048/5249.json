  "Problem": "Consider a linear system described by Laplace Transformations, where an initial function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is transformed into \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{g(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). Here, \\\\( g(t) = e^{at}\\\\), and an intervention involves multiplication by the function \\\\( h(t) = t^n \\\\), where n is a positive integer.\n\nIf the function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is transformed without intervention, will the nature of \\\\( G(s) \\\\) for a given s be the same as simply applying Laplace Transform on \\\\( g(t) \\\\) initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without intervention, the transformation from \\\\( g(t) \\\\) to \\\\( G(s) \\\\) follows the direct application of the Laplace Transform, resulting in \\\\( G(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) which is a standard result directly derived from the transformation rule.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation of g(t) = e^(at) into G(s) is unchanged by multiplying g(t) by h(t) = t^n before applying the Laplace Transform, as the Laplace Transform of g(t)h(t) introduces additional terms involving s and n."
