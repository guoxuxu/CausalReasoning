  "Problem": "Consider a sequence of complex transformations applied to a function \\\\(h(z)\\\\) in the complex plane, described by \\\\(h_1(z) = e^{Az}h(z)\\\\) initially and then \\\\(h_2(z) = e^{Bz}h_1(z)\\\\) after some time T, where A and B are complex constants.\n\nGiven the outcome of \\\\(h_3(T)\\\\), can we definitively determine the sequence and nature of transformations (A, B, and C)?",
  "Explanation": "Similar to the previous cases without additional intervention, the exponential transformations result in a final form that is effectively the exponentiation of a summed constant. It is thus impossible to uniquely identify or distinguish the sequence or values of A, B, and C just from the final transformation due to their cumulative effect.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The function h(z) is transformed into h_1(z) through multiplication by e^(Az), then h_1(z) is further transformed into h_2(z) through multiplication by e^(Bz), resulting in h_2(T) which becomes h_3(T)."
