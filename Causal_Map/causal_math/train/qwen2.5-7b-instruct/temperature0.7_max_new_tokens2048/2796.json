  "Problem": "Consider the complex integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{C} \\\\frac{e^{az}}{z - w} dz \\\\) over a closed contour C in the complex plane, where a and w are constants, and w lies inside C. This transformation explores the impact of parameter 'a' on function behavior around singular point w.\n\nGiven the output function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) after an intervention, can one deduce whether the original transformation parameter was 'a' or the intervened 'a + b' based only on the output?",
  "Explanation": "The final expression of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) can be achieved through various combinations of the original and intervened parameters a and 'a + b' due to the overlapping functional impacts on the complex integration path and the exponential factor. Therefore, it is unfeasible to distinctly attribute the result to either 'a' or 'a + b' without additional information about timing or nature of the intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
