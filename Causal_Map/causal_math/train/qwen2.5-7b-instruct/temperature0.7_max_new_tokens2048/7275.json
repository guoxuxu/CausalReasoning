  "Problem": "Consider a system described by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing angular frequency, and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state. We examine the impact of a transformation by the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant, on the system's evolution.\n\nIf a new function \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a different real constant) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces another factor influencing the system’s evolution. The ultimate state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on the compounded effects of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), affecting both the amplitude and phase of the waveform.",
