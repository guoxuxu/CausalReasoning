  "Problem": "Consider a complex function given by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function is analyzed under the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\theta}z \\\\), with \\\\( \\theta \\\\) being a constant phase shift.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\phi}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\phi \\\\) is another constant phase) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\theta \\\\) or \\\\( \\phi \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces another modifying factor, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on \\\\( \\omega \\\\), \\\\( \\theta \\\\), and \\\\( \\phi \\\\). The initial phase shift \\\\( \\theta \\\\) and the later phase shift \\\\( \\phi \\\\) interact, influencing the trajectory and final state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The endpoint z(T) depends on ω through z(t) and is independent of θ and φ. θ → z(t) and φ → z(t) indicate that θ and φ affect z(t) but not z(T) directly; ω → z(T) shows that ω is the primary factor influencing z(T)."
