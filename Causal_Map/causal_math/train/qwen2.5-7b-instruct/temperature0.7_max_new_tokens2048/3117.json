  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) in the complex plane, transforming its domain using a Möbius transformation given by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\frac{az + b}{cz + d} \\\\), where \\\\( a, b, c, \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\) are complex constants with \\\\( ad - bc \\\\neq 0 \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is computed, will this give the same result as directly applying \\\\( f \\\\) to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then applying \\\\( g \\\\) to the result?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( f \\\\) and the Möbius transformation \\\\( g \\\\) do not generally commute. Specifically, applying \\\\( g \\\\) then \\\\( f \\\\) results in \\\\( f(g(z)) \\\\), whereas applying \\\\( f \\\\) then \\\\( g \\\\) on \\\\( z \\\\) gives \\\\( g(f(z)) \\\\). Their effects are different because \\\\( f \\\\) and \\\\( g \\\\) alter the domain in uniquely different ways, which aren't interchangeable.",
