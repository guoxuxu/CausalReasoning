  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\) in the complex plane where \\( A \\) is a non-scalar constant matrix. Examine the evolution of the function under different mappings and their compositional effects.\n\nKnowing only the output \\( f(z) \\), can we determine explicitly whether \\( T(z) \\) or \\( G(z) \\), or both were applied as interventions?",
  "Explanation": "The complexity and compositional ambiguity of matrix transformations in exponential functions hinder the ability to retroactively determine the path or type of interventions applied solely based on the output. Non-uniqueness in exponential mappings under non-commutative matrices adds to this ambiguity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
