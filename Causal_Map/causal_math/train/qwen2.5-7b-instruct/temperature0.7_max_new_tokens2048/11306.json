  "Problem": "Consider a linear system characterized by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where \\\\(M\\\\) is a constant matrix. To examine causal inference, we analyze the effects of applying the transformation \\\\( h(z) = S^{-1}e^{Dt}Sz \\\\), where \\\\(D\\\\) is another constant matrix and \\\\(S\\\\) is an invertible matrix.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can the initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) be unequivocally inferred if it is unknown whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without confirmation on the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), the potential modification of the initial condition by \\\\(S\\\\) and \\\\(D\\\\) makes it impossible to backtrack uniquely to \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The matrix transformation can encode or disguise original values in a manner that cannot be simply reversed based on \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone.",

List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
