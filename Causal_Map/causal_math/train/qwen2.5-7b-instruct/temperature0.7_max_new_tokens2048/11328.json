  "Problem": "Consider the scenario where a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves in the complex plane under the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We study how the Fourier Transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t)) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\), affects our understanding of the system.\n\nGiven the Fourier Transform of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) where T > t_1 after some unknown interventions, is it possible to precisely determine the interventions applied (e.g., value of \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) or other transformations)?",
  "Explanation": "While the Fourier Transform will provide detailed frequency information, identical spectral characteristics can result from different phase shifts or other transformations of similar nature. Therefore, without additional information, it's impossible to precisely identify the specific interventions or their parameters based solely on the transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
