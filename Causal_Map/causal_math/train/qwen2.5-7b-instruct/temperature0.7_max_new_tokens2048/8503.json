  "Problem": "Consider a linear algebra situation where a complex function \\\\( z(t) = xe^{iwt} \\\\) is applied over time to an initial complex vector \\\\( x \\\\), and the behavior of the system is studied under the transformation \\\\( T_t(x) = e^{At}x \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit.\n\nIf an intervention using another modification \\\\( z'(t) = xe^{-iwt} \\\\) is applied at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state at \\\\( t = T \\\\), for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\), depend solely on the matrix \\\\( A \\\\) and not on the initial or intervening modifications?",
  "Explanation": "The final stage \\\\( t = T \\\\) will be influenced by both the initial modification \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and the intervening modification \\\\( z'(t) \\\\). The application of these complex exponential functions alters the trajectory depending on their respective frequencies and the effects of \\\\( e^{At} \\\\), resulting in a final state that does not depend solely on the matrix \\\\( A \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
