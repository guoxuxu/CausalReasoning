  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a frequency parameter and \\\\( i \\\\) the imaginary unit. This function represents the solution to the linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\). We examine the effect of applying a linear operator, represented by matrix A, to alter the function: \\\\( f(z) = Az \\\\).\n\nCan we infer the original complex value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, without knowing whether operator A was applied at t=0?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone isn't sufficient to uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) unless the nature of A is explicitly known. The operator A could alter the initial state in a way that isn't invertible purely from knowledge of \\\\( z(T) = e^{i\\\\omega T}Az_0 \\\\) without additional information about A.",
