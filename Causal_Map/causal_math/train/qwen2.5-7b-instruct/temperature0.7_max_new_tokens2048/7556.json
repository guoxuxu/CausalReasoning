  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where a continuous function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) describes a complex-valued signal, and the Laplace transform \\\\(Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s)\\\\) is used to analyze the system's frequency domain properties. The signal is transformed using a complex function \\\\(f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant angular frequency.\n\nKnowing only the final transformed signal at time T, can one uniquely identify the sequence and types of interventions (whether \\\\(f(z)\\\\), \\\\(g(z)\\\\), or both) applied based on the observed characteristics of the signal?",
  "Explanation": "The final characteristics of the signal might stem from combined or isolated effects of the interventions of different frequencies. Without knowing the modulation frequencies or phases applied at each step, it's impossible to ascertain the precise intervention sequence solely from the final signal properties.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
