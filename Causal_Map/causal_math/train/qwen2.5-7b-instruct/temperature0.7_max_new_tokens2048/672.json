  "Problem": "Consider a linear system of equations represented by \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), where A is a matrix and b is a vector. Explore the effects of applying a transformation matrix \\\\(T\\\\) to both sides of the equation, resulting in \\\\(T(Ax) = Tb\\\\).\n\nCan the initial system \\\\(Ax = b\\\\) and the transformations \\\\(T\\\\) and \\\\(S\\\\) be uniquely identified at some time \\\\(t\\\\) given only the final transformed system \\\\(S(TAx) = S(Tb)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the final state \\\\(S(TAx) = S(Tb)\\\\), it is not possible to uniquely backtrack to determine both the initial conditions (\\\\(Ax = b\\\\)) and the transformations applied (\\\\(T\\\\) and \\\\(S\\\\)). Multiple combinations of initial conditions and transformations can lead to the same final state due to properties like non-invertibility or commutativity issues with matrix operations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation matrix T affects A and b to produce TAx and Tb respectively. The transformation matrix S further transforms TAx and Tb to SATx and STb respectively."
