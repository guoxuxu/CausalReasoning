  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation on a function space, described by the integral transform \\\\(T[f](x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} K(x, s)f(s) ds\\\\), where \\\\(K(x, s)\\\\) is the kernel function. We examine the transformation's behavior when the function \\\\(f(s) = e^{-s^2}\\\\) is introduced, and how adding a multiplication by \\\\(e^{as}\\\\) as an intervention affects transformations.\n\nIf at a certain point a modulation by \\\\(e^{as}\\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the outcome \\\\(T[f](x)\\\\) for the altered \\\\(f(s) = e^{-s^2}e^{as}\\\\) be equivalent to that from the original function \\\\(f(s) = e^{-s^2}\\\\) under the transformation \\\\(T\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the form of \\\\(f(s)\\\\), specifically modulating it by \\\\(e^{as}\\\\), which will alter the integral transform outcome due to the change in the function's behavior across the domain of integration. This results in a potentially different \\\\(T[f](x)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "K(x, s) → T[f](x); f(s) = e^{-s^2} → T[f](x); f(s) = e^{-s^2}e^{as} → T[f](x)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The kernel function K(x, s) determines the transformation T[f](x). The function f(s) = e^{-s^2} transforms to T[f](x) through K(x, s), and when f(s) is modulated to e^{-s^2}e^{as}, the resulting transformation T[f](x) changes accordingly."
