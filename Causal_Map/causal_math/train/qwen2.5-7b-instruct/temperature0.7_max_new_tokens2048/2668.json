  "Problem": "Consider a continuous system described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -kz \\\\), where k is a positive constant. The system undergoes an analysis involving a Fourier transform defined by \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the frequency variable.\n\nGiven the spectrum of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after an unknown intervention, can we determine precisely which decay parameter (k or m) was adjusted during the system's evolution?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier spectrum of the system at T only indicates the total effective decay rate and not whether the additional decay was intrinsic (k) or due to an intervention (m). The response is integrated and does not separately reflect the individual contributions from k and m.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The decay parameter k influences the rate of change of z with respect to time, while the Fourier transform of z yields the spectrum which is related to the frequencies present in z."
