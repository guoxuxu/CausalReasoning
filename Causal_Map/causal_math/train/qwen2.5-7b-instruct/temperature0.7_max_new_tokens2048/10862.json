  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the input-outcome relationship described by \\\\( y(t) = \\int_0^t e^{A(t-s)} Bu(s) ds + e^{At}y_0 \\\\) where A and B are constant matrices and u(t) represents a control input function.\n\nCan the original state \\\\( y_0 \\\\) be uniquely determined after observing \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing the function u(t) used?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the control input u(t), we cannot uniquely reverse the state at t = T to \\\\( y_0 \\\\) because the contribution of u(t) through the integral term is unknown. The relationship between y(T) and y_0 is convolved with the effects of u(t).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
