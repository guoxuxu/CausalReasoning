  "Problem": "Consider the computation of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{ x(t) \\\\} \\\\) of a function \\\\( x(t) \\\\). Here, \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is described by the time-domain differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are matrices, and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is an input signal or control function. The Fourier transform is taken with respect to the function after applying a linear transformation \\\\( f(x) = Dx \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is a constant matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is applied at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and then the function is evolved under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{ x(t) \\\\} \\\\) be equal to \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{ Dx \\\\} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\\\( f(x) = Dx \\\\) modifies the input to the differential equation, impacting the frequency contents of \\\\( x(t) \\\\). The Fourier transform of the modified state \\\\( Dx \\\\) will therefore differ from the Fourier transform had \\\\( D \\\\) not been applied to the initial conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation f(x) = Dx at t=0 changes x(t), which then influences its Fourier transform F{x(t)}. Therefore, F{x(t)} after the transformation is not equal to F{Dx} unless D is the identity matrix."
