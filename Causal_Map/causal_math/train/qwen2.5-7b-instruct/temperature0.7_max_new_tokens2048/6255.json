  "Problem": "A physical system's temperature distribution, u(x,t), satisfies the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), with k being the thermal diffusivity. A transformation \\\\( g(u) = u + Ce^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\), where C and \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) are constants, is studied to evaluate its effect on the system.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( h(u) = u - De^{\\\\mu t} \\\\) (with D and \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\) as constants) is applied, will the resulting temperature distribution at a later time T be influenced only by the heat equation properties and not by the transformations \\\\( g(u) \\\\) or \\\\( h(u) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) with \\\\( h(u) \\\\) adds a new variable influencing the system, along with the prior effect of \\\\( g(u) \\\\). Both transformations affect the evolution and the final state of the system in combination with the dynamics prescribed by the heat equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
