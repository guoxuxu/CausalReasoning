  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = c(t) + id(t) \\\\), where \\\\( c(t) \\\\) and \\\\( d(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t. The system undergoes a Fourier transformation, defined as \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transformed function \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) after convolution with \\\\( h(t) \\\\), can we precisely determine both the interventions and the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\) solely from \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the convolution results in a multiplication in the frequency domain, it generates ambiguities — multiple functions \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\) could result in the same product, \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\). This indeterminacy prevents uniquely identifying the interventions and the original signal.",
