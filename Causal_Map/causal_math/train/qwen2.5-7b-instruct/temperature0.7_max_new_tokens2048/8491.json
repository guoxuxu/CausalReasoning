  "Problem": "Assume that a function \\\\( h: \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\) is defined as \\\\( h(z) = e^{az} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. We investigate the effects of this transformation on complex-valued functions and their corresponding Fourier Transforms.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( a \\\\) to a new value \\\\( b \\\\) at some point after \\\\( f(z) = e^{az}g(z) \\\\) was initially transformed, and then the Fourier Transform is recalculated, will the outcome only depend on the new value \\\\( b \\\\), not on \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by changing \\\\( a \\\\) to \\\\( b \\\\) does not erase the effects of the initial application of \\\\( e^{az} \\\\) on \\\\( g(z) \\\\). The outcome in the Fourier domain will reflect a combined influence of both the original transformation by \\\\( a \\\\) and the intervention by \\\\( b \\\\), creating composite effects.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
