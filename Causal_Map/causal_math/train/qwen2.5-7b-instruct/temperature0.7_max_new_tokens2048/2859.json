  "Problem": "Assume a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\) in a complex domain, defined as \\\\( f(x, y) = x^2 + iy^2 \\\\). The causal inference involves analyzing transformations through the function and the reverse mapping from the function back to its inputs.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( y \\\\) by a scaling factor \\\\( \\lambda \\\\), and the system is subsequently allowed to evolve under \\\\( f(x, \\lambda y) \\\\), will the output be solely determined by the original variable \\\\( x \\\\) and the scaling factor \\\\( \\lambda \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Though the transformation of \\\\( y \\\\) to \\\\( \\lambda y \\\\) alters \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\), the dependence on \\\\( y \\\\) remains. The system’s output depends complexly on both \\\\( x \\\\) and the new value \\\\( \\lambda y \\\\), indicating a dependency on both the original input and the intervention’s magnitude.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
