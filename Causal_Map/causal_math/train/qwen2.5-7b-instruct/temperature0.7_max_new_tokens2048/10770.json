  "Problem": "Consider a model where the temperature change in a material over time is governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. An external heat source is introduced via a transformation \\\\( f(u) = u + h(t) \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent function representing the heat input.\n\nGiven the temperature distribution \\\\( u(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine the initial condition \\\\( u_0 \\\\) without knowing the specific function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) used?",
  "Explanation": "The additional heat input \\\\( h(t) \\\\) alters the initial and subsequent states, making it impossible to uniquely backtrack to \\\\( u_0 \\\\) without exact knowledge of \\\\( h(t) \\\\). Multiple configurations of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) could lead to the same observed \\\\( u(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The time-dependent heat input h(t) influences the temperature distribution u(T) at time T, which in turn determines the initial condition u_0."
