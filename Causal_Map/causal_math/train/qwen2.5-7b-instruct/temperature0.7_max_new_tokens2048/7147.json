  "Problem": "Consider a control system modeled by the function \\\\( f(z) = \\int_0^T e^{At}z(t) dt \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and z is a function representing system states over time. The impact of applying a transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\int_0^T e^{B(t-s)}z(s) ds \\\\), where B is another constant matrix, is analyzed.\n\nIf an intervention is applied at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by introducing a new transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\int_{t_1}^T e^{C(t-s)}z(s) ds \\\\) (where C is a constant matrix), will the final output \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at time T be dependent exclusively on A?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) adds an additional layer of influence through the matrix C affecting the subsequent state of z. This results in an output at T that is a result of the compounded effects of A, B (from the initial \\\\( g(z) \\\\)), and C, making the final system state a function of all three matrices.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
