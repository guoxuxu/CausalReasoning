  "Problem": "Consider a system influenced by the heat equation in a rod, described by \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\) where \\\\( u \\\\) represents the temperature, \\\\( t \\\\) is time, and \\\\( x \\\\) is the position along the rod. Analyze the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) with respect to \\\\( x \\\\) to the equation and the inverse transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\) after a specific time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nGiven the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\), can we determine accurately what interventions were applied (like \\\\( g(u) \\\\) or other modifications), just by analyzing \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of similar temperature distributions from different interventions and the non-unique nature of additional disturbances mean that without further specific information, it's impossible to definitively ascertain the interventions applied during the process.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The change in temperature over time (u_t) directly causes changes in the second derivative of temperature with respect to position (u_xx); the temperature distribution at a specific time (u(x,T)) evolves into the temperature distribution at a later time (u(x,t)); applying a Fourier transform to the temperature distribution at time T results in the transformed temperature distribution (U(k,T)); transforming back using the inverse Fourier transform on the transformed temperature distribution at a later time (U(k,t)) yields the temperature distribution at that later time."
