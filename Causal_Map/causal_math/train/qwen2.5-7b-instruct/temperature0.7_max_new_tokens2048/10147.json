  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) follow the differential equations given by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) respectively, with constant matrices A and B. We examine the effect of a transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another constant matrix, on the trajectory of z over time t.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention using a function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is a constant matrix) is applied, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on A and B, and not on C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces new dynamics, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on C and D, in addition to A and B. The compounded effects of \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) influence the overall trajectory and final position.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
