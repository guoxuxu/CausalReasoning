  "Problem": "Evaluate the nonlinear system governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = z^n + c \\\\) where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex function of a real variable \\\\( t \\\\), \\\\( n \\\\) is a positive integer, and \\\\( c \\\\) is a complex constant. We consider transformations using a function \\\\( h(z) = z^{m} \\\\), where \\\\( m \\\\) is an integer, applied at different time points.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to an initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), and then the system evolves according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = z^n + c \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = z^n + c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^{m} \\\\) initially multiplies the degree of \\\\( z \\\\) by \\\\( m \\\\), altering the trajectory of the system. The evolution path of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) becomes dependent on \\\\( z_0^m \\\\), rather than simply \\\\( z_0 \\\\), thus resulting in a different trajectory and endpoint at time \\\\( T \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state z_0 directly influences z(t) through the evolution governed by dz/dt = z^n + c. Applying the transformation h(z) at t=0 changes z(t) compared to directly evolving z_0 under the same dynamics."
