  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) defined over time, where the state of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at any time t is influenced by \\\\(z_0\\\\) and a transformation \\\\(z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0\\\\), with \\\\(A\\\\) a real constant. We investigate the role of applying a linear transformation \\\\(f(z) = Bz\\\\), where \\\\(B\\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nUpon observing the resultant \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can it be concluded whether the initial vector was \\\\(z_0\\\\) or \\\\(Bz_0\\\\) without knowing if the transformation \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied at the outset?",
  "Explanation": "Since the function \\\\(f(z) = Bz\\\\) could alter the state in a non-identifiable way (if the matrix B commutes with \\\\(e^{iAt}\\\\)), it is not possible to unequivocally backtrack to the exact initial conditions just by knowing \\\\(z(T)\\\\), without clear information on whether the transformation was applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
