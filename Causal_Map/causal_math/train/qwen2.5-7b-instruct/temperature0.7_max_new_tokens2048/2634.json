  "Problem": "Analyze the system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + L(u) = 0\\\\), where L is a linear operator. We examine the effects of applying a Fourier transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(k, t) \\\\), which changes the domain from time-space to frequency-time.\n\nCan we reconstruct the initial function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) from the transformed function \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether the Fourier transform was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "With Fourier transforms, the frequency domain contains the complete information about the spatial configuration at any time, allowing for full reconstruction of the initial state from the transformed state at any other time, given the nature of linear homogeneous partial differential equations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "L(u) → ∂u/∂t; Fourier transform → change from time-space to frequency-time; u(x, 0) → hat{u}(k, T); hat{u}(k, T) → information about u(x, 0)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Fourier transform to the solution u(x,t) at time t=T changes its domain from time-space to frequency-time, allowing us to infer information about the initial condition u(x,0) from the transformed function \\( \\hat{u}(k, T) \\). The linear operator L(u) influences the time derivative of u(x,t), and knowing \\( \\hat{u}(k, T) \\) can help reconstruct u(x,0) without directly knowing the initial function."
