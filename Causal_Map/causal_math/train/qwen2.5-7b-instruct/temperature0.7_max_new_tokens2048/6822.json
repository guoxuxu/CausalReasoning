  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) affected by a linear time-dependent operator \\\\( L(t) = Ae^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real scalar. The evolution of the system without interventions follows the integral equation \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t L(s)z(s) ds + z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial condition.\n\nObserving \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at some final time \\\\( T \\\\), can we determine the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) if we don't know the function \\\\( L(t) \\\\) that was applied continuously?",
  "Explanation": "Without precise knowledge of \\\\( L(t) \\\\), particularly how \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) interact with the system over time, it's impossible to reconstruct \\\\( z_0 \\\\) unequivocally. The continuous interaction of \\\\( L(t) \\\\) with \\\\( z(t) \\\\) means knowing the end state alone isn't sufficient to backtrack accurately without additional information.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of \\( z(T) \\) at time \\( T \\) depends on the initial condition \\( z_0 \\) and the integral effect of \\( L(t) \\) over time. Since \\( L(t) \\) is unknown, determining \\( z_0 \\) from \\( z(T) \\) is challenging."
