  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(f(z) = z^2 + 1\\\\) and its impact on a contour integral over a closed path in the complex plane. Analyze how the transformation \\\\(g(z) = z + ai\\\\) (where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit) affects the evaluation of the integral \\\\(\\\\oint_C f(z) \\\\, dz\\\\) around a simple closed contour \\\\(C\\\\).\n\nKnowing the value of the integral \\\\(\\\\oint_{C'} f(z) \\\\, dz\\\\), can we reconstruct the exact original contour \\\\(C\\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(g(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since multiple contours in the complex plane could yield the same integral value due to symmetries or specific functional behaviors within those contours, it's impossible to definitively determine the original contour \\\\(C\\\\) from the integral value alone, especially without knowledge of the application of \\\\(g(z)\\\\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation g(z) changes the function f(z) and thus affects the evaluation of the integral ∮_C f(z) dz. Knowing the integral ∮_C' f(z) dz does not allow us to uniquely reconstruct the original contour C without information about the transformation g(z)."
