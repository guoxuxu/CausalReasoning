  "Problem": "Consider a feedback control system with a controlled function \\\\(F(x, u) = A x + B u\\\\), where x is the state vector, u is the control input, A is the state matrix, and B is the control matrix. We are interested in the impact of a perturbation transformation \\\\(h(x) = Cx\\\\), where C is a constant matrix, on the evolution of the state vector over time under the control strategy that minimizes a quadratic cost function.\n\nIf \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied to the initial state vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, followed by application of the optimal control sequence without further modifications, will the final state vector \\\\( x(T) \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was used as the initial state without applying \\\\( h(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(x) = Cx \\\\) modifies the initial state, potentially altering the optimal control responses due to the different initial conditions. This can lead to a different state vector at time T, as the system's response is sensitive to initial conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the perturbation transformation h(x) to the initial state vector x_0 at t=0 results in a modified initial state x_0', which then evolves over time to produce x(T). Without applying h(x), the original state x_0 evolves to produce the same x(T) under the optimal control strategy."
