  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, and \\( z \\) is subjected to the integral transformation \\( Z(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\, dt \\), with complex variable \\( s \\). Analyze the effects of modifying \\( u(t) \\) or \\( v(t) \\) separately on \\( Z(s) \\).\n\nGiven the transformed output \\( Z(s) \\), can we precisely determine whether the changes were applied to \\( u(t) \\) or \\( v(t) \\), especially if we do not know the nature of interventions?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\( Z(s) \\) is a composite function capturing the integrated effects of both \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\), without knowledge of the specific form or timing of interventions, it is impossible to accurately attribute observed changes in \\( Z(s) \\) to alterations in \\( u(t) \\) or \\( v(t) \\) independently.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Modifying u(t) or v(t) directly influences Z(s) through the integral transformation, but without additional information about the nature of the intervention, it is not possible to precisely determine which specific function was modified based solely on Z(s)."
