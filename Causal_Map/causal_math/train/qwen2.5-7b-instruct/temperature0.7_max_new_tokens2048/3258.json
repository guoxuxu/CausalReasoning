  "Problem": "Assume we have a system represented by the complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) following the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. At time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant, is applied.\n\nKnowing the form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\), can we accurately determine the initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without information on whether transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) (the transformation \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha T}z_0 \\\\)), it's impossible to unambiguously deduce the correct initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) because the exponential factor introduced by \\\\( f(z) \\\\) could significantly modify the observed state at \\\\( t = T \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
