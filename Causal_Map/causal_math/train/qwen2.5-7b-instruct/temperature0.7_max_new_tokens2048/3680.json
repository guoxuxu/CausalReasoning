  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{at}\\\\) where \\\\(a\\\\) is a complex constant. The Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) = Z(s)\\\\) is taken to analyze the behavior in the frequency domain. We explore the effects of modifying the exponent by a real number \\\\(b\\\\) through the transform \\\\(f(z) = e^{bt}z\\\\).\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\(Z(s)\\\\) at s = p, can we ascertain exactly what transformations were applied (whether \\\\(f(z)\\\\), \\\\(g(z)\\\\), or both), solely from the value of \\\\(Z(s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final form of \\\\(Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - (a+b+c)}\\\\) does not provide explicit details on the individual contributions of \\\\(b\\\\) and \\\\(c\\\\) since any number of combinations of these constants can lead to the same sum \\\\((a+b+c)\\\\). This ambiguity prevents definitive tracing of which specific transformations were applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
