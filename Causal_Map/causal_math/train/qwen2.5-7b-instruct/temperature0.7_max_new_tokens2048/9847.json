  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) applied to a variable \\\\( z \\\\) in the complex plane. The impact of this transformation is studied over the path of the unit circle in the complex plane, described by \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where \\\\( t \\in [0, 2\\\\pi] \\\\).\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied at \\\\( t = \\\\pi \\\\) as an intervention, will the resulting path depend only on the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) and not on \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) squares each point on the circle, resulting in a shorter period of traversal (completing a full loop in \\\\( \\\\pi \\\\) time units instead of \\\\( 2\\\\pi \\\\)). Applying \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) before \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and then evolving could impact the specific points and their sequencing on the unit circle due to initial direction modification, hence affecting the subsequent transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The path of z(t) in the complex plane is determined solely by its definition as e^(it), and the intervention g(z) = z^2 at t=π modifies z(π) independently of the continuous transformation f(z) = 1/z."
