  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix, and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. The function evaluates the transformation of complex functions in the complex plane and further examines how transformations such as Fourier Transform affects the signal.\n\nGiven \\\\( F(w) \\\\), the Fourier Transform of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), can one uniquely determine the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) without additional information or conditions?",
  "Explanation": "Under typical conditions where \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is well-behaved (i.e., it meets all necessary conditions for the Fourier Transform to be reversible like bandlimitation), one can uniquely reconstruct \\\\( f(z) \\\\) from \\\\( F(w) \\\\) using the Inverse Fourier Transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The Fourier Transform F(w) of f(z) allows us to infer f(z), given that f(z) depends on the complex matrix A and the complex variable z."
