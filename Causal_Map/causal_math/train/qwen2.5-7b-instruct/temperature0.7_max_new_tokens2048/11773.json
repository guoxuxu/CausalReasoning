  "Problem": "Consider a linear algebra problem involving an initial matrix \\u0027X\\u0027. The function \\u0027f(X) = e^{At}X\\u0027 transforms \\u0027X\\u0027 over time \\u0027t\\u0027, where \\u0027A\\u0027 is a constant skew-symmetric matrix. This explores changes under the integral transformation using the Laplace Transform of \\u0027X\\u0027.\n\nCan the initial matrix \\u0027X_0\\u0027 at time \\u0027t = 0\\u0027 be exactly determined from observing \\u0027X(T)\\u0027 at time \\u0027T\\u0027 without knowing if \\u0027f(X)\\u0027 was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Given the orthogonality of \\u0027e^{At}\\u0027 resulting from a skew-symmetric \\u0027A\\u0027, the original matrix \\u0027X_0\\u0027 can be recovered by applying the inverse transformation \\u0027e^{-AT}\\u0027 to \\u0027X(T)\\u0027. This inverse operation accurately retrieves \\u0027X_0\\u0027, whether or not \\u0027f(X)\\u0027 was initially applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
