  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\) where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are complex variables and the function is defined as \\\\( f(x, y) = e^{Ax + By} \\\\). Here, A and B are constant matrices. We assess how the sequence of partial differentiation with respect to \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) and their integrations influence the outcome.\n\nCan we determine which transformations were applied (original derivatives and/or intervention by \\\\( g(x, y) \\\\)) by examining the final form of \\\\( z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final form of \\\\( z \\\\) could result from different combinations of differentiation, integration, and transformations due to the non-commutative properties of matrix exponentiation. Identifying specific transformations from the end result is not deterministically feasible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
