  "Problem": "Consider a heat distribution on a metal rod described by the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) represents the temperature at point x and time t, and k is the thermal diffusivity. Assess the effect of a heat source represented by a function \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\) added at specific points over time.\n\nIf a cooling function \\\\(c(x, t) = -r u\\\\) (where r is a constant rate of heat removal) is applied as an intervention at a certain time \\\\(t_1 < T\\\\), will the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) be independent of the earlier heat source \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\) at t=0?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention through \\\\(c(x, t)\\\\) changes the system dynamics post-intervention; however, the effect of the earlier heat source \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\) at t=0 still influences the temperature distribution up to time \\\\(t_1\\\\), and indirectly affects the subsequent evolution of the temperature. Hence, \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) remains dependent on both the initial heat source and the cooling intervention.",
