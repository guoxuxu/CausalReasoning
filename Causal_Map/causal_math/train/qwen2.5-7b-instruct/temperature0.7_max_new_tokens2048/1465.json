  "Problem": "Consider a signal process represented by a function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the Laplace Transform \\( Z(s) = L\\{z(t)\\} \\), where \\( z(t) = e^{At} \\) and A is a constant matrix. We analyze the effect of an input signal modified by the transformation \\( h(t) = e^{Bt} \\) on the system's response over time t, where B is another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\( h(t) \\) is applied to a system with initial condition \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\( z(t) = e^{At} \\) without further intervention, will \\( z(T) \\) at T be the same as if \\( z_0 \\) was directly evolved to T under \\( z(t) = e^{At} \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\( h(t) \\) modifies the input signal, which alters the system's response compared to an unmodified input. Since \\( e^{Bt} \\) impacts the evolution of the system's state depending on the properties of B relative to A, the state at time T will be different.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input signal modified by \\( h(t) = e^{Bt} \\) influences the system's intermediate state, which is then governed by \\( z(t) = e^{At} \\) to produce the final state \\( z(T) \\). Directly evolving the initial condition \\( z_0 \\) under \\( z(t) = e^{At} \\) would produce a different final state \\( z(T) \\) unless \\( h(t) \\) does not alter the initial condition."
