  "Problem": "Consider that velocity \\\\( v \\\\) of a particle moving in a one-dimensional space is governed by the equation \\\\( v = \\\\omega x \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant. We examine the effects of an integral transform \\\\( I(x) = \\\\int x e^{-\\\\lambda t} dt \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is also a constant, applied to the position \\\\( x(t) \\\\) of the particle.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( J(x) = x^2 \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the velocity \\\\( v(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) or the effects of \\\\( J(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( J(x) \\\\) further alters the position of the particle by squaring it, thereby influencing the velocity \\\\( v(T) \\\\) greatly. This makes the final velocity dependent not only on the original constant \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) but also on the effect of the initial integral transformation \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) and the subsequent application of \\\\( J(x) \\\\).",
