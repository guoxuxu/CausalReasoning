  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We investigate the effects of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\) on the signal and explore varying the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of the system at t = 0 after observing the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in the complex plane over time without knowing the initial position?",
  "Explanation": "The trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) specifically the rate of rotation around the origin directly corresponds to the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). By analyzing the periodicity of the trajectory, we can determine \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The frequency ω directly influences z(t), which in turn determines the trajectory in the complex plane over time t."
