  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t, governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. We evaluate the effects of a Fourier transform defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-2\\pi i \\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\) on z(t).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) starting from t = 0 and evolves naturally under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) without any external intervention, will the Fourier transform of z(t) at t = T differ from that of the initial conditions directly evolved to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the Fourier transform does not alter the physical evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), it only provides a transformation into the frequency domain. The dynamics governed by A and B remain unaffected by the Fourier transform itself, hence the spectrum at t = T should depend only on these dynamics and initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of x(t) under the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and y(t) under \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\) directly influences z(t) through the relationships x(t) → z(t) and y(t) → z(t). The Fourier transform of z(t) at time T will differ from the Fourier transform of its initial conditions if either x(t) or y(t) changes over time due to the differential equations governing them."
