  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. The function describes a rotation in the complex plane over time t. We analyze the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\).\n\nIf a new transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) \\\\) is applied immediately after \\\\( g(z) \\\\) from time T to U, will the state at time U depend on the initial function form given \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The differential intervention \\\\( h(z) \\\\) effectively resets the state manipulation by taking the derivative, which brings the focus back to the original function form \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\). Therefore, the state at time U exclusively relies on \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) and on how the derivative operation manipulates the function's rotation.",
