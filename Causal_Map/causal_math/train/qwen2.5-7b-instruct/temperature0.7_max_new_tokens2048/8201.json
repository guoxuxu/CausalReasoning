  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the output \\( z \\) depends on the input \\( x \\) through a linear transformation and an integral transform with kernel \\( K(s, t) \\). Specifically, \\( z(t) = \\int_0^T K(s, t) x(s) \\, ds \\) where \\( T \\) is a fixed time horizon.\n\nIf \\( x(s) \\) is given as \\( x(s) = e^{As}x_0 \\) (where \\( A \\) is a constant matrix and \\( x_0 \\) is the initial condition), will the output \\( z(T) \\) solely depend on the kernel \\( K(s, t) \\) and not on the specifics of \\( A \\) or \\( x_0 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\( z(T) \\) depends on the convolution of \\( K(s, t) \\) and \\( x(s) \\). Since \\( x(s) \\) itself is influenced by \\( A \\) and the initial condition \\( x_0 \\), these elements directly affect \\( z(T) \\). The kernel \\( K(s, t) \\) modulates this effect but does not override the influence of \\( A \\) and \\( x_0 \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The output z(T) is determined by the kernel K(s, t) and the input x(s), which itself is influenced by the initial condition x_0 and the constant matrix A. However, the specific values of A and x_0 do not directly affect z(T) independently; they are embedded within the form of x(s)."
