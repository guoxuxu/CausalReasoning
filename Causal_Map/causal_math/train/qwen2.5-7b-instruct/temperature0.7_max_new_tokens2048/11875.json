  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform applied to a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}h(t) dt \\\\). The behavior of the function \\\\( h(t) = \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\) is analyzed under different settings, where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the resultant Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t) + g(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) is given, can we determine the specific form of the intervention (\\\\( g(t) \\\\)) even when knowing \\\\( h(t) = \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Even when aware that \\\\( h(t) = \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\), the specific form of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) cannot be unequivocally deduced from the resulting combined transform, due to the potential for various functions to produce similar transform results when added to \\\\( \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
