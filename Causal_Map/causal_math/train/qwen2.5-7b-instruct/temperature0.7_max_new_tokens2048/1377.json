  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations modeled as \\\\( Ax = b \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and b is a known vector. We analyze the impact of applying a transformation matrix T, where \\\\( Tx = y \\\\) changes the basis of the solution and subsequently applying the inverse transformation \\\\( T^{-1}y = x \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is applied to vector \\\\( x \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under the equation \\\\( Ax = b \\\\) without further intervention, will the solution \\\\( y \\\\) in the new basis at the end still satisfy \\\\( Ay = b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) changes the basis of \\\\( x \\\\) to \\\\( y \\\\). The system in the new basis is \\\\( AT^{-1}y = b \\\\), not \\\\( Ay = b \\\\). Without converting back, the system equation does not hold as directly transformed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying transformation T to vector x results in vector y, and if vector y satisfies the equation Ay = b, then the original vector x, when transformed back by T^-1, will satisfy the original equation Ax = b."
