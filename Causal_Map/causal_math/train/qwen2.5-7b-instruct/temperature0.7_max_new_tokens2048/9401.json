  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where s is a complex number. We investigate the causality in the changes of original function and its behavior under various transformations.\n\nIf the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is an exponential function like \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) where a is a real number, will the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f) \\\\) change essentially if we modify \\\\( a \\\\) slightly?",
  "Explanation": "Changing \\\\( a \\\\) affects the decay or growth rate of the function \\\\( e^{at} \\\\), which fundamentally alters the responses of its Laplace transform, shifting the pole of \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) in the complex plane. The Laplace transform will therefore change essentially.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
