  "Problem": "Assess the causal relationship in a vector field defined by \\\\( z(x, t) = Ax + tBx \\\\) where A and B are fixed matrices and x is an input vector. An integral transform \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{sC}z(x, s) ds \\\\) is applied to z(x, t), involving a matrix C.\n\nCan the origin vector x be uniquely reversed from the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) without any additional information apart from the outcome after T?",
  "Explanation": "Since multiple combinations of x, A, B, and C can lead to the same transformed outcome \\\\( T(z) \\\\), it is impossible to uniquely determine x without further information on the parameters A, B, and even C.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input vector x is transformed into z through a function, and z is then transformed into T(z) via an integral transform involving matrix C."
