  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by a complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. Evaluate the impact of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s} z(s) \\\\, ds \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nCan we reconstruct the original function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) over an interval [0, T] from the value of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) integrates and modifies the original function over the interval, producing a single value or function of time that lacks the information required to uniquely reconstruct \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over the entire interval due to the irreversible nature of the integration process.",
