  "Problem": "In a stochastic process, the change in a variable X is governed by the differential equation \\\\( dX_t = \\mu X_t dt + \\sigma X_t dW_t \\\\), where \\\\( \\mu \\\\) is the drift coefficient, \\\\( \\sigma \\\\) is the volatility coefficient, and \\\\( dW_t \\\\) represents the increment of a Wiener process. We study how the application of a transformation \\\\( h(X) = X^2 \\\\) impacts the process over time.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( X(T) \\\\) at time T, can we accurately determine which transformations were applied (either \\\\( h(X) \\\\), \\\\( k(X) \\\\), or both) during the process, only by knowing \\\\( X(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( X(T) \\\\) can potentially result from different sequences or types of transformations due to the nonlinear effects on the stochastic path. These transformations and their sequence play a significant role in shaping the trajectory, and without additional information, one cannot uniquely determine what transformations were applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The change in X over time (dX_t) is influenced by the drift (μ), volatility (σ), and random increments (dW_t). Applying the transformation h(X) = X^2 results in X^2, but determining which transformations were applied based solely on X(T) is not straightforward."
