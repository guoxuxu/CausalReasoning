  "Problem": "Assess the effects of a Fourier transform on a function \\\\( g(t) = e^{-at^2} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a positive constant, and its impact on system behavior described by a differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + bx = g(t) \\\\), where \\\\( b \\\\) is also a constant.\n\nGiven the final output \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can one uniquely determine the specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and function-switch (from \\\\( g(t) \\\\) to \\\\( h(t) \\\\)), purely based on observing \\\\( x(T) \\\\) and knowing the system's equation?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact moment and nature of the intervention from the final observation \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is generally complex due to the superposition principle in linear systems and the potential similarity in the effect of different functions on the system. The outputs can be heavily overlapped and obscured by system dynamics, making it impossible to uniquely backtrack the timing and type of input changes without additional information.",
