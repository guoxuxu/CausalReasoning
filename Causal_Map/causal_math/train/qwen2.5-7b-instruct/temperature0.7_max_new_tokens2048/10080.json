  "Problem": "Consider a control system formulated by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx + u\\\\), where D is a constant matrix and u is a control vector. The study considers the transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(x) = e^{Mt}x \\\\), applied at certain intervals, where M is a distinct constant matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we identify precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( g(x) \\\\), \\\\( h(x) \\\\), or both), solely by knowing the value of \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping effects of matrix exponentials, particularly when M and N do not commute with D or each other, make it difficult to deduce exactly which transformations were applied. Different combinations of the interventions could potentially lead to the same endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\), thus preventing the precise identification of the applied transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The control input u directly influences the state x over time. The transformation g(x) depends on the matrix M and the time interval T, which in turn affects the state x at time T."
