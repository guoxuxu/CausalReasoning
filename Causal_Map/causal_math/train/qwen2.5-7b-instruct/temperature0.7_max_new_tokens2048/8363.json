  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant frequency. We investigate the dynamics of this function under the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-ist}z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z'(t) = e^{itunes}z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) is a fixed real number, will the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z'(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) at \\\\( s = w + u \\\\) remain qualitatively different from its values at other \\\\( s \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by multiplying \\\\( e^{itunes} \\\\) shifts the frequency component from \\\\( w \\\\) to \\\\( w+u \\\\). Correspondingly, the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z'(t)\\\\} \\\\) concentrates at \\\\( s = w+u \\\\) with a Dirac delta function, making it distinct at this frequency compared to others.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The frequency w influences z(t), which in turn affects the Fourier transform F{z'(t)}(s) at s = w + u; the fixed real number u modifies z(t) to z'(t), which then changes F{z'(t)}(s) such that at s = w + u, the transform is qualitatively different from other values of s."
