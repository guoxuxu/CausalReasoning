  "Problem": "Investigate a unitary transformation system defined by \\\\(z(t+1) = Uz(t)\\\\) where \\\\(U\\\\) is a unitary matrix and \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is a complex vector. Consider the impact of the transformation \\\\(g(z) = Vz\\\\), where \\\\(V\\\\) is another unitary matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\(g(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the initial state was transformed by \\\\(V\\\\), it’s impossible to uniquely determine \\\\(z_0\\\\) just from \\\\(z(t)\\\\). The potential application of \\\\(V\\\\) could have modified \\\\(z_0\\\\), and because both \\\\(U\\\\) and \\\\(V\\\\) are unitary, they preserve the norm but change other properties, impeding the exact trace back to \\\\(z_0\\\\) without additional information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state of z at time t+1 is determined by the unitary transformation U applied to the state of z at time t. The application of the transformation g does not affect the causal relationship between the state of z at different times unless g itself is applied at each step."
