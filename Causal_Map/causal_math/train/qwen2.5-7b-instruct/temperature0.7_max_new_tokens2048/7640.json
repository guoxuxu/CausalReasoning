  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}z_0 \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant angular frequency and \\( z_0 \\) is the initial complex number. Analyze the effect of a Laplace transformation \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\) applied to this function.\n\nGiven the system's state \\( z(T) \\), is it possible to determine whether the Laplace transform was applied at any point, or can the same state arise from multiple transformation scenarios?",
  "Explanation": "The specific properties of \\( e^{i \\omega t} \\) under the Laplace transform do not uniquely modify the frequency or phase in a way that cannot be replicated by natural evolution or other frequency-shift transformations. Hence, multiple scenarios can lead to the same \\( z(T) \\), obscuring the details of any transformations applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The time-domain function z(t) is transformed into the frequency-domain function Z(s) via the Laplace transform. The system state at time T influences the value of z(T), which in turn determines Z(s)."
