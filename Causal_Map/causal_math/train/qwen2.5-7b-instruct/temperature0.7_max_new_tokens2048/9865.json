  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), evolving over time t according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\). We investigate whether the application of a Fourier transform affects the interpretation or evolution of the function.\n\nIf a Fourier transform is applied to \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) continues to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\) without intervention, will the function behave the same way as if only \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\) was applied from the start?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform alters the representation of the function from time domain to frequency domain, changing its interpretation and potentially affecting subsequent analyses or transformations. Thus, the behavior under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\) post-transformation will be different in the frequency domain than just evolving \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in the time domain.",
