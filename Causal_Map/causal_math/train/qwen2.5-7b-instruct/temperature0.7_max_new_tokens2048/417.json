  "Problem": "Let's examine the role of a control function \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) in determining the solution to the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + x\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0\\\\) under different scenarios.\n\nIf \\\\(u(x, 0) = \\\\sin(x)\\\\) is given as an initial condition and the system evolves according to the PDE without intervention, will the final state \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) be the same as for the initial \\\\( \\\\sin(x - t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The PDE given has characteristics that propagate solutions along curves defined by \\\\(dx/dt = x\\\\). Given the initial form \\\\(u(x, 0) = \\\\sin(x)\\\\), it evolves according to \\\\(u(x, t) = \\\\sin(x - t)\\\\), maintaining the form due to the conservative nature of the equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u(x, 0) = sin(x) directly causes the solution u(x, t) to evolve over time as sin(x - t), assuming the PDE \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + x\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0 \\) holds without intervention."
