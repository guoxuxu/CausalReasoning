  "Problem": "Suppose we have a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We are interested in how the application of a Fourier transform affects this function and the consequences of its application on the behavior of the system.\n\nHaving observed the transformed function \\\\( Z(\\omega) \\\\) post-intervention, can we precisely determine whether a phase shift was applied, solely based on \\\\( Z(\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The phase information is preserved in the Fourier transform, allowing us to detect changes such as the phase shift. A deviation in the phase from the expected for \\\\( e^{i \\omega t} \\\\) in \\\\( Z(\\omega) \\\\) can indicate that a phase shift intervention occurred.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
