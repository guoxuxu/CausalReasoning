  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\\\), where A and B are scalar constants determining the growth rate in two different components x and y, respectively, as functions of time t.\n\nIf an intervention in the form of a linear transformation \\\\( L(x, y) = (x + ky, y + kx) \\\\) (where k is a known constant) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), and the system evolves to time T > t_1, will the form of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) still be explicitly dependent only on the original growth rates A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( L(x, y) \\\\) modifies the trajectory of both components by mixing \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) which introduces additional complexity into the system, making the solution at T dependent not only on A and B but also on the intervention parameter k. Thus, the final form of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) cannot be computed merely based on A and B alone.",
