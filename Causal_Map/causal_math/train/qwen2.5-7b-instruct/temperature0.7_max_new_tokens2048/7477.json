  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2 u}{dx^2} + k^2 u = 0\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a constant. We analyze the impact of the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx}u(x)dx\\\\) on the function \\\\(u(x)\\\\) and its alteration after a transformation defined by \\\\( v(x) = u(x) + ax \\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( v(x) = u(x) + ax \\\\) is applied to \\\\( u(x) \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under the original differential equation without further intervention, will the transformed function \\\\( v(x) \\\\) satisfy the original equation?",
  "Explanation": "The additional term \\\\( ax \\\\) does not satisfy the original differential equation, \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2 ax}{dx^2} + k^2 ax = k^2 ax\\\\), which is non-zero unless \\\\(a = 0\\\\). This means the new function \\\\(v(x)\\\\) will not satisfy the original equation, altering the system's behavior.",
