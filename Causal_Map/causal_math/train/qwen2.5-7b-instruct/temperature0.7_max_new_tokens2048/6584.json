  "Problem": "Consider a system based on the function \\\\( z(x) = e^{Ax} \\\\), where A is a complex matrix and \\\\( x \\\\) is a real scalar. We evaluate the effect of applying a transformation \\\\( h(z) = Bz \\\\), where B is also a complex matrix, on the variable \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(X) \\\\), is it possible to precisely determine what transformations were applied (whether \\\\( h(z) = Bz \\\\), \\\\( g(z) = Cz \\\\), or both) just by knowing the value of \\\\( z(X) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the non-commutative properties of matrix operations and multiple potential paths to the same final state \\\\( z(X) \\\\), it's impossible to definitively conclude the sequence or type of transformations applied. The same endpoint can result from different interventions or initial conditions, leading to ambiguity in tracing back the causal path.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
