  "Problem": "Consider the solution to the initial value problem defined by \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2 u}{dx^2} + p(x) \\\\frac{du}{dx} + q(x)u = 0 \\\\) with initial conditions. An integral transform, specifically the Laplace Transform, is used to simplify this differential equation to a form involving complex functions.\n\nIf after applying the Laplace Transform an additional modifying transform, say a Fourier Transform, is used and then invertibly transformed back, will the resulting function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) reflect changes due only to the original differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying an additional transform such as the Fourier Transform introduces new variables and potentially alters the solutions characteristics. Although the original differential equation governs the behavior of \\\\( u(x) \\\\), the additional transformation impacts the final outcome, modifying the original solution structure.",
