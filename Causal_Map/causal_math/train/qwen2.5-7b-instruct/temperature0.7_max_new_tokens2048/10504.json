  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit where the voltage across an element is described by the complex function \\\\( V(t) = Ve^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), with \\\\( V \\\\) as a constant voltage amplitude and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) as the angular frequency. The response of the circuit (current, \\\\( I(t) \\\\)) is given by a convolution involving the circuit's impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and the voltage \\\\( V(t) \\\\).\n\nWith the knowledge of \\\\( I(T) \\\\) at a specific end time \\\\( T \\\\) along with the unaltered part of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) from \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( t_1 \\\\), can we pinpoint whether the filter \\\\( f(t) = e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\) was applied at \\\\( t_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the full dynamics of the system post-\\\\( t_1 \\\\), we cannot definitively ascertain if the filter was applied based purely on \\\\( I(T) \\\\). Similar current patterns could be produced by other equivalent changes in the system, such as alterations in other circuit elements or different types of filtering.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
