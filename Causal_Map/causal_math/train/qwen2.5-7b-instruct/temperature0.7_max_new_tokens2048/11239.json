  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iCz \\\\), where C is a real constant representing frequency. The impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{-iCs} z(s) ds \\\\) is studied over the interval \\\\( [0, T] \\\\).\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{2iCs} z(s) ds \\\\) is applied at some time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\) during the evolution, could the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be solely dependent on the original differential equation's constant C, without any influence from the transformations \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The subsequent interventions with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and prior application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) introduce additional dynamics into the evolving state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) through composite effects of their respective integral transformations, influencing the final state observed at time T beyond just the impacts of C.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The final state z(T) is influenced by the constant C through the differential equation and indirectly by C through the transformations f(z) and g(z). However, z(T) is not solely dependent on C without considering the effects of f(z) and g(z)."
