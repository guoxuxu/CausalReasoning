  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = u(x, y, t) + iv(x, y, t) \\\\), a complex-valued function of two spatial variables and time, governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = -i\\\\nabla^2 z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 \\\\) is the Laplacian operator in two dimensions.\n\nIf an intervention is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) with another function, say \\\\( w(x, y, t) = k(x, y)z \\\\) where k(x, y) is another complex function, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced solely by the initial wave equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = -i\\\\nabla^2 z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( w(x, y, t) \\\\) introduces another complexity to the system, asserting that influences from function k(x, y) also play a crucial role in shaping the final state at time T, alongside the original wave equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of z(t) over time is driven by the Laplacian of z, and an intervention w(x, y, t) can alter z(t) starting from t_1."
