  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( g(z) \\) defined on the complex plane as \\( g(z) = e^{cz} \\) where \\( c \\) is a constant complex number. The function is studied under the Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{g(t)\\}(s) \\) which transforms \\( g(t) \\) from the time domain to the complex \\( s \\)-domain.\n\nGiven the resulting function \\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-e} \\) in the \\( s \\)-domain after the transformation, can the specific interventions (whether \\( g(t) \\), \\( h(t) \\), or both) be identified solely from \\( H(s) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed function \\( H(s) \\) showing a pole at \\( s=e \\) cannot conclusively indicate whether it was a result of \\( c \\), \\( d \\), or a combination \\( c + d = e \\). This ambiguity arises because the algebraic properties of the exponential function blend the effects of \\( c \\) and \\( d \\) without distinguishable traces in the resultant \\( H(s) \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The function g(z) is transformed by the Laplace Transform into H(s), and the constant c in g(z) influences the form of H(s); the variable s in H(s) is the transform variable."
