  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a constant frequency parameter. We investigate the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) defined by \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i \\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf a transformation \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is modified at some intermediate time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by an additional function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) that adjusts its amplitude, will the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at T > t_1 demonstrate solely the effect of the original \\\\( i\\\\omega z \\\\) frequency component?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) modifies the amplitude, and potentially the phase, thereby altering the original frequency components present in \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Thus, the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at T > t_1 reflects the new characteristics introduced by \\\\( h(t) \\\\), alongside the original frequency determined by \\\\( i\\\\omega z \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of z(t) over time, governed by the differential equation dz/dt = iωz, directly influences its Fourier transform F(z)(ω). At any time t, including t_1, modifying z(t) with h(t) changes z(t), which in turn affects F(z)(ω). Therefore, F(z)(ω) at T > t_1 will reflect the combined effects of the original frequency component iωz and the modification by h(t) up to time t_1."
