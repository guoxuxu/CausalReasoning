  "Problem": "Consider a linear system where the temperature distribution \\\\(T(x,t)\\\\) along a rod evolves according to the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\) where k is the thermal diffusivity. We analyze the effect of an intervention defined by a change in boundary conditions from \\\\(T(0, t) = T_0\\\\) (a constant temperature) to an impulse response \\\\(T(0, t) = T_0 + \\\\delta(t)\\\\) at a specific time.\n\nIf an impulse response intervention \\\\(\\\\delta(t)\\\\) at \\\\(x=0\\\\) is introduced at t = 0, will the temperature distribution at \\\\(x=L\\\\) for a later time \\\\(T > 0\\\\) still follow the same pattern as if the boundary had been constantly \\\\(T_0\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of an impulse response at the boundary condition modifies the temperature evolution. The delta function introduces a discontinuity, altering the temperature pattern at \\\\(x=L\\\\) compared to the scenario without such an intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An impulse response δ(t) at x=0 causes a change in the temperature T(0, t), which then influences the temperature distribution T(x, t) along the rod. As a result, the temperature at x=L for a later time T > 0 will differ from the case where the boundary was constantly T_0."
