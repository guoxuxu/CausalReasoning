  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Schrödinger equation for a quantum particle in a potential, \\\\( i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial t} = -\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m}\\\\nabla^2 \\\\psi + V(x) \\\\psi \\\\), where \\\\( V(x) \\\\) is the potential energy function. We investigate the effect of applying a transformation represented by a unitary operator \\\\( U(t) = e^{-iHt/\\\\hbar} \\\\), where H is a Hamiltonian operator.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( V(t) = e^{-iKt/\\\\hbar} \\\\) (where K is another Hamiltonian operator) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on H and not on K?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( V(t) \\\\) introduces a new modifying factor, making the final state \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\) dependent on both H and K. Both Hamiltonian operators influence the evolution by affecting the phase and configuration of the wave function, leading to a state that is dependent on the specifics of both H and K.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation U(t1) and V(t1) at time t1 causes a change in the wavefunction ψ(t1+dt), which then propagates to the endpoint ψ(T) for T > t1. Both transformations affect ψ(t1+dt), but the endpoint ψ(T) depends primarily on the Hamiltonian H rather than K."
