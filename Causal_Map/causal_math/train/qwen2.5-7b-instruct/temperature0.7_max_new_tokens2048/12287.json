  "Problem": "Investigate a discrete dynamical system governed by the linear transformation \\\\( x_{n+1} = Mx_n \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant square matrix representing the evolution operator, and \\\\( x_n \\\\) is the state vector at the n-th step. We also explore the influence on the system of applying a nonlinear transformation \\\\( h(x) = x + u \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) is a constant vector.\n\nKnowing the series of state vectors up to \\\\( x_n \\\\) and considering that interventions \\\\( h(x) \\\\) and \\\\( j(x) \\\\) occurred, is it possible to determine exactly what these interventions were, including the values of \\\\( u \\\\) and \\\\( v \\\\), based solely on the value of \\\\( x_n \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Even with full tracking of the state evolution, the specific values of \\\\( u \\\\) and \\\\( v \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined based solely on \\\\( x_n \\\\) because different combinations of these vectors and timing of their applications could result in the same final state, particularly due to the linear nature of matrix multiplication and vector addition.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution operator M directly influences the state vector x_n through successive transformations. The nonlinear transformation h(x) → x + u and j(x) → x + v add constant vectors u and v respectively to the state vector."
