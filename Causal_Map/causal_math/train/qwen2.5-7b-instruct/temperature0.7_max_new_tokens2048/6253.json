  "Problem": "A physical system's temperature distribution, u(x,t), satisfies the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), with k being the thermal diffusivity. A transformation \\\\( g(u) = u + Ce^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\), where C and \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) are constants, is studied to evaluate its effect on the system.\n\nDoes the application of \\\\( g(u) \\\\) to the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) at t = 0 and letting it evolve under the heat equation change the temperature distribution at a later time t = T compared to just letting \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) evolve under the heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(u) \\\\) modifies the initial condition by adding \\\\( C \\\\) which evolves exponentially with time. This impacts the distribution, making it deviate from the path it would follow under the heat equation alone, accounting for the integration of the transformation over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial temperature distribution u_0(x) directly influences the temperature distribution u(x,t) and u'(x,t) through the heat equation and the transformation g(u). The thermal diffusivity k directly influences both u(x,t) and u'(x,t). Applying g(u) to u_0(x) results in a different temperature distribution u'(x,t) at any time t compared to the evolution of u_0(x) under the heat equation alone."
