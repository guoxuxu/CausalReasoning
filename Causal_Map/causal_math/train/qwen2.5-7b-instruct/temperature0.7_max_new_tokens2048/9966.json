  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = e^{iwx} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We assess the effect of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on this function, given by the integral \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z)(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{iwx} e^{-ikx} dx \\\\), analyzing both the direct transformation and its inversion.\n\nGiven the transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z)(k) \\\\) as \\\\( 2\\\\pi \\\\delta(k - w) \\\\), can we conclusively determine \\\\( z(x) \\\\) at any prior time without further data?",
  "Explanation": "The transform result \\\\( 2\\\\pi \\\\delta(k - w) \\\\) uniquely identifies the original function \\\\( z(x) = e^{iwx} \\\\) due to the property of the Fourier transform being a bijective operation on functions of this form. The delta function's location directly indicates the frequency component in \\\\( z(x) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of w directly influences the Fourier transform, which in turn determines z(x) through the transform and its inversion."
