  "Problem": "Consider a vector field \\( V \\) in a complex domain, represented as \\( V(z) = u(z) + iv(z) \\) where \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) are real-valued functions of the complex variable \\( z \\). We examine the situation where an integral transform \\( T \\), particularly the Laplace Transform, is applied to \\( V \\).\n\nCan the original vector field \\( V(z) \\) be uniquely reconstructed at \\( z = z_0 \\) after observing its transformed state \\( T(V)(s) \\) without knowledge of any specific boundary conditions or initial function forms?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform is not always invertible without additional information such as boundary conditions or the behavior of \\( V \\) over a region. Hence, one cannot uniquely determine \\( V(z_0) \\) from \\( T(V)(s) \\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
