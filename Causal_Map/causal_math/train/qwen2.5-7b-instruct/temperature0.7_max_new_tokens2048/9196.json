  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) ruled by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Az + Bz^2 \\\\), where A and B are constants. We investigate the impacts of the linear transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) where C is also a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of interventions using \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\), and their timing, could yield the same endpoint due to the complex, non-linear interactions within the system and the transformations. The exponential growth factors blur distinct pathways to the same endpoint, making it impossible to distinguish between possible intervention histories.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
