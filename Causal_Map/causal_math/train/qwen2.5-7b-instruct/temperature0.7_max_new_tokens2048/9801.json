  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{s^2} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T[z] \\\\) is applied to the function at t = 0, and the system is allowed to evolve naturally under \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) without further intervention, will the resulting function at t = T simply be the initial function integrated with \\\\( e^{s^2} \\\\) up to T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T[z] \\\\) modifies the nature of the original function by integrating it with \\\\( e^{s^2} \\\\), which significantly alters its properties and results. This new function is not merely \\\\( e^{it} \\\\) integrated with \\\\( e^{s^2} \\\\); it is a fundamentally different function resulting from the combination of the two influences over the interval from 0 to T.",
