  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\( f(z) = e^{i\\omega t}z \\), utilized in the context of a linear transformation in the complex plane over time \\( t \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real number representing angular frequency. The evolution of a complex function \\( g(z) = az + b \\) follows, where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are complex constants.\n\nGiven only the end result \\( z(T) \\), can one determine exactly which transformations were applied (whether \\( f(z) \\), \\( g(z) \\), \\( h(z) \\), or some combination), without additional data about the sequence or parameters?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of parameters and sequences for \\( f(z) \\), \\( g(z) \\), and \\( h(z) \\) might yield the same final result \\( z(T) \\) due to properties like rotational symmetry and linear transformation complexity in the complex plane. Without precise sequence and parameter information, deducing the exact transformations used cannot be reliably done.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
