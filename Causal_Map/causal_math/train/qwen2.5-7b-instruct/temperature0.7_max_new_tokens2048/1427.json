  "Problem": "Suppose we have a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We are interested in how the application of a Fourier transform affects this function and the consequences of its application on the behavior of the system.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by applying a phase shift, \\\\( z(t) = e^{i(\\omega t + \\phi)} \\\\), will the Fourier transform of the modified function \\\\( Z(\\omega) \\\\) for times \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) only depend on the original angular frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not on the phase shift \\\\( \\phi \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduced phase shift \\\\( \\phi \\\\) alters the phase content of the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), which impacts its Fourier transform. Thus, \\\\( Z(\\omega) \\\\) representing times \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) will reflect both the original frequency and the effects of the phase shift intervention.",
