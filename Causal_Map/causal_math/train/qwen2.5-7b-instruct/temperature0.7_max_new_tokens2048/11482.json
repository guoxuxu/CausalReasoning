  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), defined in a closed path in the complex plane, where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are differentiable functions of t. The transformation operator \\\\( T \\\\) is defined as \\\\( Tz = z^2 \\\\), applied to the path of z.\n\nCan the original complex path \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be uniquely determined from the transformed path at t = T if we know the path has been subjected to \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While knowing the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) helps, many different paths could potentially yield the same transformed path due to the nature of complex square functions, where both positive and negative roots are possible for each point on the resultant path.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
