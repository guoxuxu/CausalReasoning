  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable z, defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z^t dt \\\\), where s is a complex parameter. The question examines the sensitivity of the integral transformation under varying parameters.\n\nIf the parameter s is increased, resulting in a shift from s to \\\\( s+\\\\delta \\\\), without any other intervention, will there be any change in the integral transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "An increase in s makes the exponential decay faster, effectively weighting the integral more towards the lower values of t. This results in a change in the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\), altering the output of the integral transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
