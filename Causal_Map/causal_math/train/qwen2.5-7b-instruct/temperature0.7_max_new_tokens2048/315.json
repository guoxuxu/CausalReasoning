  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. We examine the impact of a linear transformation \\\\( f(z) = Mz \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a complex constant matrix.\n\nIf, at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = Nz \\\\) (where \\\\( N \\\\) is another complex constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( k \\\\), \\\\( M \\\\), or \\\\( N \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be influenced by all mentioned variables (\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), \\\\( k \\\\), \\\\( M \\\\), and \\\\( N \\\\)). The new intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) alters the trajectory in a compound manner with the existing dynamics and the preceding transformation \\\\( M \\\\).",

List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
