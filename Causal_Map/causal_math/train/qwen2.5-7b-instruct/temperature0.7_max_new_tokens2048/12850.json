  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, describing a system exhibiting harmonic motion in the complex plane. An integral transformation \\\\( F(z) = \\int_{0}^{t} e^{-s\\omega} z(s) ds \\\\) is applied over time t.\n\nIf an intervention alters the function at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) = z(t) + c \\\\), where c is a constant complex number, will the transformation \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at t = T reflect only the effect of the original system described by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\omega z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by adding \\\\( c \\\\) changes the state of the system, which affects subsequent states and hence alters the result of \\\\( F(z) \\\\) calculated at any t = T. Therefore, the output will combine effects from both the original system dynamics and the intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
