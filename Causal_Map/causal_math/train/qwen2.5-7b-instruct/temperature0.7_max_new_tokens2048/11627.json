  "Problem": "Assess the study of causal inference in a system modeled by a linear partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. An integral transform \\\\(T_k(u) = \\\\int e^{-ikx} u(x,t) \\\\, dx\\\\) is applied, where k represents a frequency parameter.\n\nIf an intervention applying a secondary operator \\\\(M\\\\) is introduced at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), modifying the system's state before it evolves further, does \\\\(T_k(u(t))\\\\) for \\\\(t > t_1\\\\) depend solely on the initial operator \\\\(L\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the system's trajectory, thus \\\\(T_k(u(t))\\\\) for \\\\(t > t_1\\\\) reflects the influence of both the original operator L and the intervention M. Depending on the nature of M, it could significantly alter how u evolves, thereby influencing the outcome of the transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of u over time depends on the operator L, and applying the transform T_k reveals information about u. Introducing the operator M changes L, but T_k(u(t)) for t > t_1 still depends on the modified L rather than the original L."
