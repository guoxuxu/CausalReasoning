  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear operator equation \\\\(Lx = \\lambda x\\\\). Analyze how utilizing a transformation \\\\(T(x) = e^{i\\theta}x\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\theta\\\\) a constant, affects the system over a time-scale \\\\(t\\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\(x_0\\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\(T(x)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\(T(x)\\\\), distinguishing between a simple evolution under \\\\(Lx = \\lambda x\\\\) and one modified by \\\\(T(x)\\\\) is not possible. The phase shift introduced could be any multiple of \\\\(2\\pi\\\\), making the original state \\\\(x_0\\\\) indeterminable without more information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation T(x) = e^(iθ)x changes the state from x(0) to x(t) over time t, and observing x(t) at time t=T allows us to infer the original state x(0) if T(x) was applied."
