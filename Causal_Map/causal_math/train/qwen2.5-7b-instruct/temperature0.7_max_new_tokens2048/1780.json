  "Problem": "Consider a vector field expressed by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where A is a complex constant and z is a complex variable. Analyze the effect when a Möbius transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{az + b}{cz + d} \\\\) is applied to z, where a, b, c, d are complex constants.\n\nBased on the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we unequivocally determine what transformations were used (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), solely by analyzing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) might result from a variety of different transformations or their combinations, particularly due to the complex and non-linear nature of Möbius transformations. Identifying the exact transformations from the endpoint state alone is not possible without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of Möbius transformations f(z) and g(z) on z leads to the endpoint z(T), but z(T) alone cannot unambiguously determine which specific transformations were applied."
