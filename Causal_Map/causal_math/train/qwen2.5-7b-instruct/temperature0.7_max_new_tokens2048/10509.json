  "Problem": "In the context of function analysis, consider the equation \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are initial conditions and \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constant matrices. The effect of varying \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) under the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\) is analyzed.\n\nWhen varying matrix \\\\( A \\\\) while keeping \\\\( B \\\\) constant, will the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) directly reflect changes made to matrix \\\\( A \\\\) for all values of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The effect of varying \\\\( A \\\\) is intertwined with the influence of \\\\( B \\\\) due to the additive nature of the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Since \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is influenced by both exponential terms, the variation in \\\\( A \\\\) alone does not exclusively determine the transformed function at all frequencies, especially when interactions between the exponents become significant.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
