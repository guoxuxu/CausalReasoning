  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution over a plate is described by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = \\\\kappa \\\\nabla^2 u \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) being the thermal diffusivity constant. We explore the impact of an initial transformation using Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi) = \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}^n} e^{-2 \\\\pi i x \\\\cdot \\\\xi} u(x, 0) \\\\, dx \\\\) and study the system evolution.\n\nCan we determine the exact initial temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) from the observed temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at t = T, without knowing whether Fourier transform was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given the heat equation is linear and the Fourier transform is a linear isomorphism in proper function spaces, it is possible to correctly reconstruct \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) from the information at any later time T using the inverse Fourier transform and the known effects of \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\nabla^2 \\\\) on the evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_map": "u(x, T) ← u(x, 0); Fourier transform → transformed_u(ξ, 0); transformed_u(ξ, T) ← transformed_u(ξ, 0)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial temperature distribution u(x, 0) influences the temperature distribution u(x, T) at time T; applying Fourier transform to u(x, 0) results in transformed_u(ξ, 0), which evolves to transformed_u(ξ, T) under the same thermal diffusivity process."
