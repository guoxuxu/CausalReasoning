  "Problem": "Assume a linear system described by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\Delta u = 0\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) is a complex function of a spatial variable. We investigate how the application of Fourier transformation, denoted by \\\\(\\mathcal{F}\\\\), impacts the causal inference of effects in this system.\n\nCan the original function \\\\(u(x)\\\\) at the initial state be uniquely determined from its evolved state under only its Laplace equation transformation, after applying \\\\(\\mathcal{F}(u)\\\\) initially?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Laplace equation is linear and the Fourier Transform is an invertible linear operator, the transformed and evolved state can be uniquely inverted back to the original state \\\\(u(x)\\\\) at the initial time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The original function u(x) influences its Laplacian Δu, and through Fourier transformation F(u), it leads to the evolved state. The Laplacian being zero ensures that the evolved state is consistent with the initial function's properties."
