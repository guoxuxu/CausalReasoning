  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) represents a linear differential operator. We explore the effects of applying a Fourier Transform \\\\(F(u)\\\\) to the function \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) in terms of spatial variable \\\\(x\\\\).\n\nIf at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), a Laplace Transform \\\\(L(u)\\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\(U(p, T)\\\\) in transformed space for T > t_1 depend solely on the operator \\\\(L\\\\) and not on initial or intervening transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the Laplace Transform alters the state space by converting it from time-domain to complex-frequency domain. This new representation \\\\(U(p, T)\\\\) does depend on both the early state transformations and the dynamics under \\\\(L\\\\), as these transformations affect how the state evolves under the differential equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying a Laplace Transform L(u) at time t_1 introduces a new state U(p, T) in transformed space that depends on the operator L and the dynamics of u from t_1 onwards, independent of previous Fourier Transforms F(u)."
