  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\\\), where A and B are scalar constants determining the growth rate in two different components x and y, respectively, as functions of time t.\n\nGiven the composition of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after intervention \\\\( L \\\\), can we deduce the specific nature of the intervention (values of k) and the initial conditions (\\\\( x_0 \\\\), \\\\( y_0 \\\\)) solely from the knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and the growth rates A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is shaped by the interplay between the initial conditions, the growth rates, and the intervention's properties. Without explicit knowledge of how the initial conditions were transformed by the intervention, and given the exponential influence of time through A and B, reconstructing specific details about k, \\\\( x_0 \\\\), and \\\\( y_0 \\\\) solely from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) entails high ambiguity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z(T) is influenced by the initial values of x and y, the growth rates A and B, and the elapsed time T. Specifically, x and y directly cause z(T), while A and B also directly cause z(T) through their respective exponential functions."
