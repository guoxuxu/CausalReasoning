  "Problem": "We examine the stability and effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T_w [f](x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-wt} f(t) dt \\\\) applied to the function \\\\( f(t) = e^{At} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( w \\\\) are complex constants.\n\nDoes applying \\\\( T_w \\\\) to \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and analyzing at arbitrary \\\\( x \\\\), provide the same result as if \\\\( f(t) \\\\) were directly evaluated for all \\\\( t \\\\) without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T_w \\\\) modifies the original function by including a factor of \\\\( e^{-wt} \\\\), which fundamentally alters the integration results compared to evaluating \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without it. The transform essentially filters the function through a complex exponential decay, changing its behavior and properties.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of w and A directly influences the result of the transformation, which in turn depends on the function f(t)."
