  "Problem": "Analyze the influence of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) on the stability of a linear system defined by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax \\\\), where A is a constant matrix.\n\nIf an intervention is applied at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), involving a new function \\\\( g(x) = e^{i\\\\omega t}x \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant), will the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), for T > t_1, solely rely on A and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on any initial application of \\\\( e^{it} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(x) \\\\) adds another variable to the system dynamics, influencing the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) through both the new phase imparted by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and the existing system matrix A. The effects of the initial application are still embedded in the system’s state at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), affecting how the intervention shapes the trajectory afterward.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "z(t) → x(t); A → dx/dt; z(t) → g(x); ω → g(x); t1 → g(x); t1 → x(T)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The complex function z(t) influences the state x(t) which is governed by the differential equation's right-hand side. The matrix A directly causes the rate of change of x with respect to time. The function g(x) depends on both z(t) and the constant ω. An intervention at time t1 modifies g(x) but does not affect the state x(T) for T > t1 beyond its immediate impact through ω."
