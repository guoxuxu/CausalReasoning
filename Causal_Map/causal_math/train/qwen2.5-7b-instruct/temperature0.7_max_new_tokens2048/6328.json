  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\\\(x' = Lx\\\\) where L is a linear operator. The behavior of this system is analyzed when a transformation \\\\(h(x) = Mx\\\\), where M is another linear operator, is applied.\n\nKnowing only the final state \\\\(x(T)\\\\), is it possible to precisely deduce which transformations (\\\\(h(x)\\\\), \\\\(k(x)\\\\), or both) were applied during the evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Given the multiplicative effects of matrix transformations and the potential for various sequences of applications (either M, N, both, or none), several possible paths could lead to the same final state \\\\(x(T)\\\\). This ambiguity prevents accurately tracing back the exact interventions applied solely based on the outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The derivative of x at time T (x'(T)) directly causes the state of x at time T (x(T)). Applying transformation h(x) directly causes the derivative of x at time T (x'(T)). Similarly, applying transformation k(x) directly causes the derivative of x at time T (x'(T))."
