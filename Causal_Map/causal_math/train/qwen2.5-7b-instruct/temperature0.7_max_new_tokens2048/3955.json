  "Problem": "Analyze a complex electrical circuit involving resistors (R), capacitors (C), and inductors (L), modeled by the differential equation \\\\(V(t) = L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI + \\\\frac{1}{C}\\\\int I dt\\\\), where V is voltage, I is current, t is time, and R, L, C are constants. Consider the Laplace transform, defined as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt\\\\), applied to V(t).\n\nIf at time t = t1, an additional independent voltage source V1 is introduced and the system is allowed to evolve, will the resultant Laplace transform of I(t) at time T > t1 be solely determined by the original parameters of the circuit (R, L, C) and not V0 or V1?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of adding a new voltage source V1 impacts the circuit dynamics, which modifies the entire system response. This means that the final Laplace transform of I(t) will depend on both the original system parameters and the characteristics of the new voltage source, not just the initial setup.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
