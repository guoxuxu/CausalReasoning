  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) of a time-dependent signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\). Suppose the transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\frac{1}{s-a}Z(s) \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve without further intervention through inverse transformation, will the reconstructed signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at time t be the same as if \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) was inversely transformed without applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the Laplace domain representation by introducing a pole at \\\\( s = a \\\\), which fundamentally alters the time-domain behavior of the system. This will lead to a different signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) than the one that would be obtained directly from \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation f(z) to Z(s) results in Z'(s), which then influences the reconstructed signal x'(t). Without applying f(z), Z(s) directly reconstructs to x(t). The question is whether x'(t) at time t is the same as x(t) when f(z) is not applied."
