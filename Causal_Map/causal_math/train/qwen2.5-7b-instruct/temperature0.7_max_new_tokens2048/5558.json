  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where the state of a system z(t) is transformed by a complex function \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(A-iB)s} z(s) ds \\\\), where A and B are matrices, and i is the imaginary unit. This system's behavior under temporal evolution is governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) where C is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to determine whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0 or if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was simply subjected to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) without knowledge of the use of \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, the subsequent evolution under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) obscures whether the complex integration effected by A, B, and i was the initial condition, especially considering that complex exponentials and differentials don't easily reverse infer.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state z_0 directly influences the state z(t) through the transformation governed by the integral function h(z). The constant matrix C directly influences the state z(t) through the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = Cz \\). Given z(T), it is not possible to determine whether h(z) was applied at t=0 or if z_0 was subjected to \\( \\dot{z} = Cz \\) without additional information."
