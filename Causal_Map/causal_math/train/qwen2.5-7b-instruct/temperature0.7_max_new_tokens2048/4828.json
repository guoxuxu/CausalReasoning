  "Problem": "We explore a physical system where a beam is subjected to various forces over time. The forces are represented as functions of time, \\( f(t) \\), acting at different points on the beam. Fourier transforms of these functions (\\( F(\\omega) \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is the frequency) are used to analyze the system's behavior in the frequency domain. The structural integrity response of the beam, \\( R(\\omega) \\), depends on these inputs.\n\nIs it possible to determine accurately whether the original force \\( f(t) \\) or the additional damping force \\( g(t) \\) or both were applied, by only analyzing the frequency spectrum \\( R(\\omega) \\) at a specific \\( \\omega_3 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Though \\( R(\\omega) \\) at \\( \\omega_3 \\) provides information about the overall effects on the beam, it does not unambiguously distinguish between contributions from \\( f(t) \\) and \\( g(t) \\). Both forces alter the frequency response, and without temporal information or additional context, it is not feasible to dissect their separate impacts strictly from \\( R(\\omega_3) \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
