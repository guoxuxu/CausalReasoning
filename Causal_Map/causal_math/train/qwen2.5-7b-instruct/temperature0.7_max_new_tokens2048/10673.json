  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Sturm-Liouville problem \\\\( -\\\\frac{d}{dx}\\\\left(p(x) \\\\frac{dy}{dx}\\\\right) + q(x)y = \\\\lambda w(x)y \\\\), where \\\\( p(x), q(x), w(x) \\\\) are given functions and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is the eigenvalue. An integral transformation \\\\( T[y](x) = \\\\int_{a}^{b} k(x, t)y(t)dt \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( k(x, t) \\\\) is the kernel of the transformation.\n\nIf the integral transformation \\\\( T[y](x) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( y(x) \\\\) adhering to the Sturm-Liouville boundary conditions and then the function is evolved under the same Sturm-Liouville problem, will the transformed function still be a solution?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T[y](x) \\\\) may not preserve the boundary conditions or the structure required by the Sturm-Liouville problem, altering how the function satisfies the differential equation. The eigenfunctions corresponding to \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) will likely change unless \\\\( k(x, t) \\\\) has specific properties related to the operators in the equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the integral transformation T[y](x) to a function y(x) results in a new function y'(x). The coefficients p(x) and q(x) in the Sturm-Liouville equation affect the second derivative of y(x), while w(x) influences its first derivative. The eigenvalue λ scales the function y(x)."
