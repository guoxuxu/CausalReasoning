  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolving over time based on the linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iCz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a real constant. The function \\\\( g(z) = e^{iDt}z \\\\) where \\\\( D \\\\) is another real constant, represents a transformation applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iCz \\\\) without further intervention, will the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time T differ from evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) directly under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iCz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{iDt}z \\\\) initially modifies \\\\( z_0 \\\\) into \\\\( e^{iD(0)}z_0 = z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, but as t progresses, the effect of \\\\( D \\\\) continually alters the phase of \\\\( z \\). Thus, \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any time T will differ by a phase factor \\\\( e^{iDT} \\\\) compared to the trajectory of just evolving under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iCz \\\\), resulting in different trajectories.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The value of C determines the rate of change of z with respect to time. The application of g(z) transforms z at t=0 but does not change the underlying dynamics described by C. Therefore, the trajectory of z(t) at time T will be the same whether g(z) is applied initially or not."
