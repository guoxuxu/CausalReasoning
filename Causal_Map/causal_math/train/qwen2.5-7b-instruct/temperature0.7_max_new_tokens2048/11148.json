  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations expressed as \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), where A is a linear transformation in a vector space. A specific operator \\\\(T(x) = e^{Mt}x\\\\) is applied, with M being another linear matrix, affecting x through an exponential transformation.\n\nGiven the observed endpoint \\\\(x(T)\\\\), can the prior applications of transformations (either \\\\(T(x)\\\\), \\\\(U(x)\\\\), or both) be conclusively identified, based solely on the outcome \\\\(x(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) could have been produced through various combinations or sequences of transformations due to the properties of matrix exponentiation, which include nontrivial interaction and overlap in the effects on the vector space. Isolating specific interventions merely by outcome is thus unreliable.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the operator T to x results in x(T), and applying the operator U to x results in x(U)."
