  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the function \\\\( z(t) = wt \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex number with real and imaginary parts. We introduce a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) that takes the form \\\\( L(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{T} e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( T \\\\) is a finite time.\n\nCan we determine the exact time or nature of the intervention on \\\\( w \\\\) to \\\\( w' \\\\) by examining \\\\( L(z)(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output of \\\\( L(z)(T) \\\\) integrally combines effects from both before and after the intervention, making it impossible to precisely identify the timing or nature of the change from \\\\( w \\\\) to \\\\( w' \\\\) solely based on the output due to the continuity and compounded effect in the integral transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of w directly influences z, which in turn is used by L to compute L(z). The constants s and T also directly influence L(z)."
