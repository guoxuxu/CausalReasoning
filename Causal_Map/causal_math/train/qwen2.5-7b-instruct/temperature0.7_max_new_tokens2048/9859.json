  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant (LTI) system represented by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Dy\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. Evaluate the system's dynamics under different transformations and perturbations using scalar functions and the Laplace transform, represented as \\\\( f(y) = Ly \\\\) where L is a linear operator.\n\nSuppose an intervention employing another function \\\\( g(y) = Py \\\\) (where P is a linear perturbation) is applied at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\). Will the state of the system \\\\( y(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on D and not on L or P?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with function \\\\( g(y) \\\\) introduces new dynamics through \\\\( Py \\\\), adding to the effects of D and the initial transformation by L. This interaction can notably change the trajectory of the system, making the final state at \\\\( y(T) \\\\) dependent on D, L, and P. The compounded impact influences the system’s state at any subsequent time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
