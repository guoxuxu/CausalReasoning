  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, where \\\\( z(x) = e^{ix} \\\\). We study the integral transformation \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) over complex variable s and real variable t.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) is modified by a scaling factor \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) such that \\\\( z(x) = \\\\alpha e^{ix} \\\\) without further transformation, will the calculated transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at s = i still result in the same value as for \\\\( z(x) = e^{ix} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The scaling factor \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) will scale the integral by the same factor because \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-st} (\\\\alpha e^{ix}) \\\\, dt \\\\) becomes \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-st} e^{ix} \\\\, dt \\\\), which modifies the magnitude of the integral and consequently the value of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).",

List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "A scaling factor α applied to z(x) changes the magnitude of Z(s), and s influences Z(s) through the integration process. Thus, modifying z(x) to αe^(ix) will change Z(s) at s=i."
