  "Problem": "Consider a system where the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\Delta u\\\\) governs the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) over a domain, with constant thermal diffusivity \\\\(k\\\\). We investigate the impact of a Fourier transform, denoted by \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x,t))\\\\), and analyze its influence on temperature evolution.\n\nKnowing the temperature distribution at \\\\(t = T\\\\) after certain unknown transformations and interventions, can we determine exactly how \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) was transformed or what interventions were applied during the evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple transformations or different types of interventions (like varying heat sources) can lead to similar or identical temperature distributions at \\\\(t = T\\\\). Without explicit information about the nature and timing of these interventions, reconstructing the exact sequence of events or transformations is not feasible.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial temperature distribution u(x,0) directly influences the temperature distribution u(x,t) at any later time t. The temperature distribution u(x,t) at time t is transformed by the Fourier transform into its frequency domain representation hat{u}(ξ,t), which at time T becomes hat{u}(ξ,T)."
