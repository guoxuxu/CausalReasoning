  "Problem": "Imagine a system modeled by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is a complex function of time. We evaluate the impact of applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nHaving observed z(T) for some T, can we determine the initial condition z(0) and the specifics of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) applied (the value of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)) solely based on this final observation?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing z(T) without additional context does not uniquely specify z(0) or the parameter \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) due to the exponential nature of the transformation. Multiple combinations of initial conditions and scaling parameters can lead to the same result, particularly since \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) can interact to produce complex behaviors.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
