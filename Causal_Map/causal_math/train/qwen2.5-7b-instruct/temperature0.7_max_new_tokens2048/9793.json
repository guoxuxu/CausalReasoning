  "Problem": "Consider a linear system modeled by the equation \\(dz = Pz \\, dt\\), where \\(P\\) is a constant matrix. Investigate the implications of applying the transformation \\( g(z) = e^{Qt}z \\) over time \\(t\\), with \\(Q\\) also being a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\( g(z) \\) is applied to a vector \\( z_0 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\), and then allowed to evolve under \\( dz = Pz \\, dt \\) without further intervention, will \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) be equivalent to if \\( z_0 \\) was directly evolved to \\( t = T \\) under \\( dz = Pz \\, dt \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\( g(z) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) modifies the initial state \\( z_0 \\) to \\( e^{Q0}z_0 = z_0 \\). However, the trajectory from \\( t = 0 \\) to \\( t = T \\) is influenced by \\( e^{Qt} \\) under \\( dz = Pz \\, dt \\), depending on the relationship between \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\), leading to a different state than the untransformed evolution at \\( t = T \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation g(z) = e^(Qt) to z_0 at t=0 and allowing it to evolve under dz = Pz dt until t=T results in the same z(t) as directly evolving z_0 under dz = Pz dt from t=0 to t=T."
