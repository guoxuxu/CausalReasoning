  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iωt} \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( ω \\\\) is a constant real number. The transformation applied on this function is given by \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\), where n is a fixed positive integer. We investigate the impact of this transformation on the function's behavior.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine what transformations were used (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), solely based on the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), specifically its magnitude and phase, could result from various combinations of n and m, giving rise to complexities that cannot be disentangled without additional data. Different pairings can yield the same outcome, making it impossible to conclusively identify the interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
