  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + c \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) represents the state of the system and c is a constant wave speed. Consider the effect of applying a Fourier transform transformation defined by \\\\( F(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} u(x,t) e^{-ikx} dx \\\\).\n\nAssuming \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) is observed and knowing whether a Fourier transform was applied at t = 0, can we deterministically backtrack to precisely deduce \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the linear characteristics of both the PDE and the Fourier transform, if the application of \\\\( F(u) \\\\) is known, one can uniquely invert using the inverse Fourier transform and solve the transport equation backwards (by reversing the wave speed c) to exactly recover \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying a Fourier transform to u(x,T) allows us to deduce u(x,0) up to a constant phase shift due to the linearity of the Fourier transform and the initial condition."
