  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) evolving under a system driven by differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Mu \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Nv \\\\), where M and N are constant matrices. An integral transform \\\\( T[w] = \\\\int_0^T e^{-At} w(t) dt \\\\) with a constant matrix A is applied to study the dynamics.\n\nIf the initial state of \\\\( z(0) = u(0) + iv(0) \\\\) is given, and systems evolve under their respective differential equations without further modification, will the calculated value of \\\\( T[z] \\\\) at T be different if the systems evolved with a different initial condition such as \\\\( z(0) = v(0) - iu(0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation of initial conditions affects the dynamics of both \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) separately. Since each evolves according to different matrices M and N and contributes to the real and imaginary parts respectively, the integral transform \\\\( T[z] \\\\) will yield different results based on the specified initial conditions and the distinguishing characteristics of M and N matrices.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state z(0) directly influences T[z]. Specifically, changes in the initial values of u(0) and v(0) will affect T[z] because they determine the behavior of u(t) and v(t) over time through the differential equations, which in turn affect the integral transform T[z]."
