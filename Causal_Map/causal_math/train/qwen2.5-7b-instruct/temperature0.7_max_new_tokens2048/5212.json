  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. Analyze the changes induced by performing a Fourier transform \\\\( \\mathcal{F} \\\\) on the function, leading to the transformed function \\\\( Z(\\\\omega') \\\\).\n\nAfter observing the Fourier transform \\\\( Z(\\\\omega') \\\\) of the intervened system (with scaling), can it be conclusively determined what operations (scaling, only Fourier transform, or both) were performed?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the scaled function \\\\( S(t) \\\\) lacks uniqueness in indicating whether a simple Fourier transform or additional scaling was applied. The resulting spectrum might hint at multiple possible manipulations, thus not allowing a definitive backward inference from the effect to the specific cause or sequence of interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function z(t) = e^(i ω t) transforms via the Fourier transform into Z(ω'), and scaling applied to Z(ω') results in further modification of its magnitude spectrum."
