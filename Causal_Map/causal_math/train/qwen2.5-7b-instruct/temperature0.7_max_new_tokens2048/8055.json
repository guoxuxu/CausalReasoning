  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t, governed by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\). The functions are subjected to transformation through an integral operator \\\\( T \\\\), such that \\\\( Tz(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{C(s-t)}z(s)ds \\\\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) an intervention is introduced by another integral operator \\\\( U \\\\) defined as \\\\( Uz(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{D(s-t)}z(s)ds \\\\) (where D is another constant matrix), will the outcome at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) and not on \\\\( C \\\\) or \\\\( D \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions with the integral transformations \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( U \\\\) combined with matrices \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) change the evolution dynamics of the functions \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\). The final state at T is thus influenced by all matrices: \\\\( A, B, C, \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\). These transformations and interactions can lead to a variety of outcomes for \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depending on the characteristics of the matrices.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The values of x(t) and y(t) determine z(t). The parameters A and B govern the evolution of x(t) and y(t) respectively. The operators C and D affect Tz(t), but do not directly influence the values of z(t) at any given time t. Therefore, the outcome of z(T) for T > t_1 depends on A and B, but not on C or D."
