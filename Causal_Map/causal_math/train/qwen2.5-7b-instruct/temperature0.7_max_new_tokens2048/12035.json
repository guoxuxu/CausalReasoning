  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where the output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is described by a Laplace transform of the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\), leading to \\\\( Z(s) = H(s)X(s) \\\\), where \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is the system's transfer function. We analyze the effect of applying a convolution transformation \\\\( y(t) = (x * h)(t) \\\\) directly on the time-domain signal, where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is the inverse Laplace transform of \\\\( H(s) \\\\).\n\nCan we exactly determine whether the convolution operation or the additional filtering operation was applied, given only the final output \\\\( z''(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Analyzing the final output \\\\( z''(t) \\\\) alone, without additional details about the transformations applied (convolution or filtering), does not allow for the precise discrimination between the convolution or filtering effects due to their potential to produce similar or indistinguishable results in the final output, especially when the system characteristics \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and \\\\( G(s) \\\\) are not distinctly separable.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "x(t) → Z(s); H(s) → Z(s); Z(s) → z(t); x(t) * h(t) → y(t); H(s) → h(t); y(t) → z'(t); z'(t) → z''(t);",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input signal x(t) is transformed by the system's transfer function H(s) to produce Z(s), which is then inverse-transformed to obtain z(t). Alternatively, x(t) can be convolved with the impulse response h(t) to get y(t), which is then transformed to z'(t) and finally to z''(t)."
