  "Problem": "Consider a function $u(x, t)$ that satisfies the partial differential equation (PDE) $\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu$, where $L$ is a linear differential operator. This scenario examines the effect of an integral transformation $T(u) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} u(x,t) \\\\, dt$, which corresponds to the Laplace transform with respect to time $t$.\n\nIf $T(u)$ is calculated at some $s = s_0$, will the transformed function still satisfy a relation similar to the original PDE, $\\\\frac{d}{ds} T(u) = -LT(u)$, based on its property as a transform of the solution to the PDE?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform converts the time derivative to a multiplication by $-s$ in the $s$-domain. Assuming $u(x, t)$ satisfies the PDE, when transformed, the new form of the equation in terms of $T(u)$ still maintains homogeneous linear properties following the rules of Laplace transforms applied to linear differential operators.",
