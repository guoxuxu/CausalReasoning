  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z \\) defined in the complex plane as \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant frequency. We study the effect of adding a linear transformation represented by \\( T(z) = az + b \\) (where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are complex constants) on the behavior of \\( z(t) \\).\n\nIf \\( T(z) \\) is applied to \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve according to the original function without further intervention, will \\( z(t) \\) at t = T behave the same as if \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) was direct without \\( T(z) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( T(z) \\) at t = 0 modifies the initial condition to \\( ae^{i\\omega t} + b \\). This alteration changes the trajectory from the original \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\), producing different complex outputs at any time \\( t \\), including \\( t = T \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
