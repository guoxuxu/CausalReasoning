  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the Poisson equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = f\\\\) in a domain \\\\(D\\\\), with \\\\(f\\\\) representing a source term. This domain undergoes a transformation \\\\(T\\\\) that maps it to a new domain \\\\(D'\\\\). The transformation changes how the system responds over time.\n\nCan the original domain \\\\(D\\\\) and source term \\\\(f\\\\) configuration be accurately determined from the solution in the modified domain \\\\(D'\\\\) with an intervened source term, based only on observing the final state in \\\\(D'\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state in the transformed domain \\\\(D'\\\\) with an additional source term results from complex interactions between domain alterations and source dynamics. These factors create a non-unique scenario where multiple configurations from the original setting could lead to similar outcomes in \\\\(D'\\\\), rendering precise backward inference impossible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformed domain D' and its intervened source term f are influenced by the original domain D and the transformation T. The source term f determines the solution u, and the transformation T maps the original domain D to the new domain D'."
