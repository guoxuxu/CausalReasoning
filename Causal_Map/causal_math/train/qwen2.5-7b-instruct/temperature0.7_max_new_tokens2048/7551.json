  "Problem": "Consider a physical system represented by a vector function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u) \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. Evaluate the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\), denoted as \\\\( v(k, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}[u(x, t)](k) \\\\), and subsequently manipulating the system using a filter function \\\\( H(k) \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a filter function \\\\( H(k) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( v(k, t) \\\\), modifying it to \\\\( w(k, t) = H(k)v(k, t) \\\\), will the future state \\\\( w(k, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be determined solely by the dynamics of \\\\( L \\\\) without the influence of \\\\( H(k) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( H(k) \\\\) as an intervention directly manipulates the frequency components of the system's state. This alteration will influence how the system evolves from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to \\\\( T \\\\), making the final state \\\\( w(k, T) \\\\) dependent on both the original system dynamics \\\\( L \\\\) and the characteristics of \\\\( H(k) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state u(x, t) transforms to v(k, t) via Fourier transform, which then modifies to w(k, t) through filter function H(k), and this modification influences the future state w(k, T) for T > t_1."
