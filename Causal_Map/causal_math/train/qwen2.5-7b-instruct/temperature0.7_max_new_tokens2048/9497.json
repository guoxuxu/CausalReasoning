  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow in a region where the velocity field is represented by a vector field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v}(x,y) \\\\). We are interested in analyzing the result of applying a rotational transformation described by the function \\\\( R(\\\\theta) = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\cos(\\\\theta) & -\\\\sin(\\\\theta) \\\\\\\\ \\\\sin(\\\\theta) & \\\\cos(\\\\theta) \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\) on this velocity field over an angle \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\).\n\nIf the velocity field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v}(x,y) \\\\) is rotated by \\\\( R(\\\\theta) \\\\) at time t = 0 and left to evolve under natural fluid dynamics without intervention, will the flow pattern at time T directly resemble the original flow pattern had there been no rotation?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the rotation matrix \\\\( R(\\\\theta) \\\\) alters the direction and possibly the interaction between velocity components in the vector field. Such a change in initial conditions can lead to different fluid dynamics behaviors over time, as the flow develops according to this new orientation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying a rotational transformation R(θ) to the velocity field \\( \\mathbf{v}(x,y) \\) results in a rotated velocity field, which then evolves under fluid dynamics to form an evolved flow pattern that does not resemble the unrotated original flow pattern."
