  "Problem": "Consider the heat equation governed by \\\\( u_t = \\\\kappa u_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( u_t \\\\) is the time derivative, \\\\( u_{xx} \\\\) is the spatial second derivative, and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the diffusivity constant. We analyze the impact of a transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(u) = u + e^{-\\\\lambda t} \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we reliably determine the original condition \\\\( u_0 \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( f(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the transformation could be applied initially, and considering the decay of \\\\( e^{-\\\\lambda t} \\\\), determining \\\\( u_0 \\\\) is not possible without additional information. The transformation modifies the initial condition, and its effects decrease over time, blending indistinguishably with the characteristics of \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at later times.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The time derivative u_t directly causes changes in u, the function f(u) directly causes changes in u, the constant λ directly causes changes in f(u), the time T directly causes changes in f(u), and the initial condition u_0 directly causes the initial state of u."
