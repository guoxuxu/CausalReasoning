  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) and its impact when applied to a function described by \\\\( g(z) = e^{az} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant. The study will examine how transformations and temporal evolutions based on these mathematical relations affect causal inferences.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to transform \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at \\\\( z_0 \\\\), and then allowed to evolve without any intervention, will the result at any point \\\\( z_1 \\\\) only depend on the value of \\\\( a \\\\) and not on \\\\( z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) to \\\\( g(z) \\\\) leads to \\\\( f(g(z)) = \\\\frac{1}{e^{az}} = e^{-az} \\\\). The subsequent evaluation at any point \\\\( z_1 \\\\) systematically depends on both the value of \\\\( a \\\\) and the specific point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) due to the involved exponential transformation and its inherent dependence on the variable.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
