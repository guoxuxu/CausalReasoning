  "Problem": "Consider a circuit system described by the integral \\( y(t) = \\int_0^t e^{-sA} x(s) \\, ds \\), where \\( A \\) is a constant matrix that represents system parameters and \\( x(t) \\) is an input signal. We analyze the impact of modifying the input signal using a transformation defined by \\( f(x) = e^{Bt}x \\), where \\( B \\) is also a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the output \\( y(T) \\) at time \\( T \\), can we infer whether the transformation \\( f(x) \\) was applied to the initial input signal \\( x_0(t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\( y(T) \\) alone may not provide enough information to determine if \\( f(x) \\) was applied. Multiple input modifications can lead to similar outputs, especially since the matrix \\( B \\) effects could be balanced or masked by the characteristics of \\( A \\) in the integral.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input signal x(t) and system parameters A directly cause the output y(t). The transformation f(x) caused by matrix B indirectly influences the output y(T) at time T through the modified input."
