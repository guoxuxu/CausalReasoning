  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear transformation \\\\( x(t) = Sx \\\\) where S is a constant matrix. The impact of the complex function \\\\( h(x) = e^{iDt}x \\\\) over time t, with D also being a constant matrix, is analyzed.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( k(x) = e^{Ft}x \\\\) (where F is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on S and not on D or F?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( k(x) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) additionally affects the trajectory initiated by \\\\( h(x) \\\\). The final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) becomes dependent on the effects of both D and F, as well as S. The end state reflects compositional influences from all the applied transformations, creating a complex dependency.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The endpoint x(T) depends on the initial state x(t_1) and the matrix S through repeated application of S, but not directly on D or F. The intervention k(x) introduces F, which affects x(t+1) but does not change the dependency of x(T) on S from t_1 onwards."
