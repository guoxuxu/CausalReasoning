  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the Laplace Transform \\\\( L(f(t)) = F(s) \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is an original time-domain function and \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is its transformation in the s-domain. We examine the system's response when subject to an operator \\\\( G(s) = e^{-as} \\\\), with \\\\( a \\\\) being a real constant.\n\nIf at a particular moment, an intervention with another operator \\\\( K(s) = e^{-bs} \\\\) (where \\\\( b \\\\) is a constant) is applied to the already transformed system \\\\( H(s) \\\\), will the final output depend solely on the original transformation \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and not on the interventions (\\\\( G(s) \\\\) and \\\\( K(s) \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "The additional intervention with \\\\( K(s) \\\\) further modifies the system by another time shift, causing an additive shift effect to the already transformed input function. The final output in the time domain becomes \\\\( f(t-a-b) \\\\), hence heavily dependent on both intervening operations as well as the original function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
