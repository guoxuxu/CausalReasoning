  "Problem": "Consider the effect of the operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(u(x)) = \\\\int_0^x e^{-(x-t)} u(t) dt \\\\), on functions and its implications in a functional space. We explore whether this transformation can alter or trace back the cause of changes in function behaviors.\n\nIf we apply another operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{M}(u)(x) = \\\\int_0^x e^{(x-t)} u(t) dt \\\\) as an intervention on the transformed function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(u)(x) \\\\), will the resultant function's form be solely dependent on the nature of \\\\( u(x) \\\\) and not on the transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the new operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{M} \\\\) further modifies the function, influenced by the changes brought through both \\\\( \\\\mathcal{M} \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\). Their combined effect shapes the final form of the function, hence it is dependent on both transformations and not solely on the original function \\\\( u(x) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
