  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = \\\\kappa u_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We explore the effect of a transformation via the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t,x)\\\\} = U(s,x) \\\\) over variable t.\n\nGiven the final observed temperature distribution \\\\( u(T,x) \\\\), is it possible to definitively know whether an intervention by changing \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) occurred without other data?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional information regarding the system's history or additional constraints, the final temperature distribution \\\\( u(T,x) \\\\) could result from various scenarios including different initial conditions or unobserved intermediate interventions. The absence of explicit signatures of the altered \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) in the final distribution alone makes it impossible to conclusively determine if such an intervention took place.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
