  "Problem": "Consider a complex function described by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( A \\\\) is a real scalar, and \\\\( x \\\\) is a complex number. The function defines a rotation in the complex plane. We study the effect of applying a linear transformation \\\\( f(z) = Bz \\\\) where \\\\( B \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( x \\\\) at t = 0, and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T differ from the evolution of \\\\( x \\\\) alone under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\) at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at the initial time modifies the starting value from \\\\( x \\\\) to \\\\( Bx \\\\). As \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}(Bx) \\\\), the trajectory will differ unless B commutes with \\\\( e^{iAt} \\\\), which is generally not the case unless \\\\( B \\\\) is a scalar multiple of the identity.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "At time t=0, applying the linear transformation f(z) to x results in z, which then evolves under z(t) = e^(iAt)x. Without further intervention, the state of z at t=T will differ from the evolution of x alone under z(t) = e^(iAt)x at t=T due to the initial application of f(z)."
