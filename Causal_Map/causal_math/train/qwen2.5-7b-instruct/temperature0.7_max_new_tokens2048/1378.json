  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations modeled as \\\\( Ax = b \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and b is a known vector. We analyze the impact of applying a transformation matrix T, where \\\\( Tx = y \\\\) changes the basis of the solution and subsequently applying the inverse transformation \\\\( T^{-1}y = x \\\\).\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( y \\\\) obtained from solving \\\\( Ay = b \\\\) in the transformed basis, can we conclude that the original state was derived by applying \\\\( T \\\\) to a vector fitting \\\\( Ax = b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Conversion using \\\\( T \\\\) and solving \\\\( Ay = b \\\\) does not ensure that the original state \\\\( x \\\\) directly solves \\\\( Ax = b \\\\), rather it solves \\\\( AT^{-1}y = b \\\\). The assumption that \\\\( Tx = y \\\\) leads directly to \\\\( x \\\\) solving the original system isn't necessarily correct.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
