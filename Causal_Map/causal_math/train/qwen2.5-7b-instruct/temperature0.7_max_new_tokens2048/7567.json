  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) governed by the system of differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{u} = Au\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{v} = Bv\\\\), where both A and B are constant matrices. To study the behavior of the system, an integral transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) is applied, with s being a complex parameter.\n\nIf an intervention is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) altering \\\\( A \\\\) to \\\\( A' \\\\), will the resultant \\\\( h(z)(T) \\\\) solely depend on the new matrix \\\\( A' \\\\) and not on the previous matrix A?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the dynamics post-\\\\( t_1 \\\\), but the state of the system prior to \\\\( t_1 \\\\) still affects the overall outcome due to the initial conditions influenced by A. Hence, \\\\( h(z)(T) \\\\) reflects a compound effect of both A and A', and the transformation aggregates these effects.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
