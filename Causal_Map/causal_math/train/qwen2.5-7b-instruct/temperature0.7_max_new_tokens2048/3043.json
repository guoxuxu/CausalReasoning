  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\) applied to a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) which evolves by the system \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = kz \\\\), with k being a complex constant. This problem examines how transformations and system dynamics interact over time.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention using another function \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\phi}z \\\\) is applied, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of the phase changes introduced by \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) further complicates the dependency of the final state on both the initial transformation by \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( h(z) \\\\). The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will reflect the cumulative effect of these transformations, resulting in a state dependent on both the respective phase shifts.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The phase changes introduced by g(z) and h(z) influence z, while k and the time intervals t1 and T determine the evolution of z through its dynamics."
