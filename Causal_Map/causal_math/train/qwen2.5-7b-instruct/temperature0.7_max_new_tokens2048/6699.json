  "Problem": "Consider a system function defined by \\\\(z(x) = \\int_{0}^{x} e^{y} dy\\\\) representing an integral transformation of the exponential function. The focus is to analyze the derivative and anti-derivative relationships between transformations.\n\nIf we modify the original integral by introducing a scaling function \\\\(h(x) = 2x\\\\) within the integrand, so the transformed function becomes \\\\(z(x) = \\int_{0}^{x} e^{2y} dy\\\\), will the simple derivative relationship to \\\\(e^{x}\\\\) still hold?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the integrand from \\\\(e^{y}\\\\) to \\\\(e^{2y}\\\\). Consequently, the derivative of \\\\(z(x) = \\int_{0}^{x} e^{2y} dy\\\\) is \\\\(e^{2x}\\\\), changing its simple derivative relationship to \\\\(e^{x}\\\\) as seen in the original setup.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
