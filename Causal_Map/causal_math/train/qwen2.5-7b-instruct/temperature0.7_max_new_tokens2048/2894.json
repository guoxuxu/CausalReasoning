  "Problem": "Examine a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) which solves the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L u \\\\) with an initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) = u_0(x) \\\\), where L represents a linear differential operator. We consider the effects of applying the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the initial condition.\n\nIf one observes the transformed state \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at time t, can they infer the original state \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) accurately without knowing the Fourier transform was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the initial application of the Fourier transform, it is impossible to correctly back-calculate to the original form of \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) as the transformed initial condition affects the evolution under the operator L, resulting in a state that does not directly map back to the original \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "u(x, t) → u_0(x); L → ∂u/∂t; Fourier transform → transformed state; transformed state → u(x, t)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The original state u(x, t) at time 0 influences the initial condition u_0(x), the linear differential operator L governs the change of u(x, t) over time, applying the Fourier transform to the initial condition yields the transformed state, and the transformed state at time t reflects the evolution of the original state under the operator L."
