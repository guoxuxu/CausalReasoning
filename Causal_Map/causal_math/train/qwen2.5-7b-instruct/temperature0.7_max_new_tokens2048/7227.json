  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) that satisfies the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Qi \\\\), where P and Q are constants. We analyze the behavior under a Fourier transform given by \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf at a particular time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention by applying another transformation \\\\( G(z) = z^2 \\\\) is made, will the resulting spectrum \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) at any time T > t_1 depend solely on the differential equation without any effect from the initial Fourier transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of \\\\( G(z) = z^2 \\\\) significantly modifies the function, adding non-linear alterations to its evolution. As such, even if the function continues to evolve under the same differential equation post-intervention, the spectrum \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) will reflect the compounded effects of the original Fourier transform, the differential equation, and the non-linear intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "P and Q directly influence F(z)(ω); applying G(z) = z^2 at t_1 causes F(z)(ω) to change to F(z)(ω)^2; F(z)(ω) at time T > t_1 depends on the transformed F(z)(ω)."
