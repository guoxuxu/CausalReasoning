  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( w(z) \\\\) that maps complex numbers to other complex numbers defined by \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a complex constant matrix. We analyze the behavior of this function under different transformations and the inversion through the integral transformation \\\\( W(u) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-uz} w(z) \\\\, dz \\\\).\n\nIf a different transformation function \\\\( v(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied at a certain complex number \\\\( z_1 \\\\) before being processed by \\\\( w(z) \\\\), will the result of \\\\( W(u) \\\\) only depend on the matrix A?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by applying \\\\( v(z) = z^2 \\\\) alters the input to \\\\( w(z) \\\\) significantly before the integral transformation. This squared intervention affects the final outcome of \\\\( W(u) \\\\), making it depend on both the alteration introduced by \\\\( z^2 \\\\) and the matrix A.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
