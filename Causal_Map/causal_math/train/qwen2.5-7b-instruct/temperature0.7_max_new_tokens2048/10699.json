  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a linear differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. The influence of a linear transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(z) = Dz \\\\) is analyzed, with D being another constant matrix.\n\nIf a new transformation \\\\( k(z) = Rz \\\\) (where R is a constant matrix) is applied at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced solely by M and not D or R?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( k(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) acts as an intervention that alters the trajectory according to R. The resulting state at time T is dependent on how M, D, and R interact through their respective transformations, even if applied successively. These transformations are not isolated; their cumulative effects shape the future states.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
