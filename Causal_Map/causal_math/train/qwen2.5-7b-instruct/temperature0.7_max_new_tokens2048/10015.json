  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the partial differential equation ∂u/∂t = Lu where L is a linear differential operator. We examine the impact of the Fourier transform on the solution, specifically, the operation defined by the function g(u) = F(u), where F denotes the Fourier transform.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(u) = F^{-1}(u) \\\\) (the inverse Fourier transform) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( u(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on L and not on the initial application of F or F^{-1}?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(u) = F^{-1}(u) \\\\) changes the state back to the time-space domain, which reintroduces the initial dependencies on the Fourier transform properties and L. Thus, the endpoint \\\\( u(T) \\\\) is influenced by the transformations F and F^{-1}, together with how L operates in different domains.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Fourier transform F of the initial condition u at time t_1 influences the solution g through the function g(u) = F(u). The inverse Fourier transform h applied at t_1 affects the solution u(T) for T > t_1. Therefore, u(T) depends on L and the intervention h(u) = F^{-1}(u) at t_1, but not directly on the initial application of F."
