  "Problem": "Investigate the effect of an external force applied to a mechanical system obeying the second order differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + p\\\\dot{x} + qx = 0\\\\), where p and q are constants. The system is subject to an impulse response represented as a transformation \\\\(g(x) = Ax + Bu\\\\), where A and B are matrices and u denotes the control input.\n\nIf \\\\(g(x)\\\\) is applied initially at time t = 0, followed by the system's natural response under \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + p\\\\dot{x} + qx = 0\\\\) with no further intervention, will the system's state \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\(g(x)\\\\) had not been applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(g(x)\\\\) changes the initial conditions by setting a new starting point for x, potentially modifying the trajectory of the system. Given that the transformation introduces a non-natural modification to the system, the eventual state at time T will differ from the trajectory without application of \\\\(g(x)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An impulse through the control input u directly influences the system state x, and the function g(x) transforms the system state x based on the control input u; therefore, applying g(x) initially changes the system state x(t) which then evolves according to the differential equation \\(\\ddot{x} + p\\dot{x} + qx = 0\\). Without g(x), the system would have evolved differently."
