  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant. This function describes a rotation in the complex plane. We examine the interactions between the Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) and a linear operator \\( L \\) defined by \\( Lf(t) = tf(t) \\) on function \\( z(t) \\).\n\nIf a modification function \\( Mf(t) = e^{at}f(t) \\) (where \\( a \\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention at a specific time \\( t_1 \\), will the final Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}[z(t)] \\) for \\( t = T \\) (where \\( T > t_1 \\)) depend solely on \\( \\omega \\) and not on \\( a \\) or the application time \\( t_1 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( M \\) introduces an exponential factor which modifies both the amplitude and phase characteristics of \\( z(t) \\), affecting the Fourier transform. The final state will thus depend on \\( \\omega \\), \\( a \\), and \\( t_1 \\), altering the spectral properties of \\( z(t) \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Fourier transform of z(t) depends only on ω and not on a or t1 because applying Mf(t) at t1 modifies z(t) but this change does not affect the frequency parameter ω which determines the Fourier transform result."
