  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The system is initially governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are real constants. A transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) is introduced where C is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied at time t = 0 to \\\\( z(0) \\\\), and then the system evolves naturally under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T = t still follow the trajectory as if \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was not applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at t = 0 modifies the initial state of \\\\( z \\\\) to \\\\( e^{Ct}z(0) \\\\). This alteration affects the evolution path of both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) as they are scaled differently due to the real and imaginary components of C, leading to a trajectory distinct from the untransformed one.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation f(z) at t=0 changes z(t), which in turn influences x(t) and y(t) through their definitions as real and imaginary parts of z(t). Without further intervention, the evolution of x(t) and y(t) under \\(\\dot{x} = Ax\\) and \\(\\dot{y} = By\\) will reflect the new initial condition imposed by f(z), altering the trajectory of z(T) for T=t."
