  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{i \\omega z} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. We analyze the impact of an operator \\\\( L \\\\) acting on \\\\( z \\\\), defined by \\\\( L(z) = z + T \\\\), where \\\\( T \\\\) is a real constant, over different scenarios.\n\nGiven the outcome \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at some point, can we determine precisely what interventions were applied (whether \\\\( L \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), if we don’t know the details of \\\\( \\theta \\\\) or T?",
  "Explanation": "Given the periodic and exponential nature of the interventions, different combinations of \\\\( \\theta \\\\), T, and whether \\\\( L \\\\) or \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied can lead to identical outcomes. This nonlinearity and lack of information about \\\\( \\theta \\\\) and T preclude a precise determination of the interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
