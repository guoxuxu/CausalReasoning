  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant. Let's analyze the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\(T[f(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt\\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex number with positive real part.\n\nGiven only the transformed result of an intervened function, can we determine if the original frequency was \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) or the modified one \\\\(\\\\omega'\\\\) in the absence of the knowledge about the exact time of intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation result \\\\(\\\\frac{1}{s-i\\\\omega'}\\\\) does not contain information about when the intervention changed \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) to \\\\(\\\\omega'\\\\). Without this temporal detail, we cannot ascertain if the transformation corresponds to the original or the modified frequency, nor the precise moment of frequency change.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The integral transformation T[f(t)] modifies the original frequency ω to ω', which influences the function z'(t) while the original function z(t) is based on ω. Given T[f(t)], we cannot distinguish between ω and ω' without knowing the exact time of intervention."
