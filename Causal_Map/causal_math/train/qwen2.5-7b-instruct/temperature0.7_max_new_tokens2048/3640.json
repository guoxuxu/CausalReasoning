  "Problem": "Consider a system where the position \\\\( x(t) \\\\) of a particle moving along a line is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = kx \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant coefficient. We examine the effect of the transformation \\\\( h(x) = x^2 \\\\) operated on the initial position \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and its impact over time t.\n\nKnowing the position \\\\( x(T) \\\\), is it possible to ascertain precisely which transformations were applied (either \\\\( h(x) \\\\), \\\\( g(x) \\\\), or both), and at what times?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact transformations and their timing from the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) alone is generally infeasible. The position could be influenced in complex ways by different combinations and timings of applications of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) and \\\\( g(x) \\\\), making unique identification challenging.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

The position x(t) directly causes the position x(T) at time T. The initial position x_0 directly causes the transformation h(x). The position x(t) directly causes the transformation h(x).
