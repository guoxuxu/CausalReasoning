  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency. We examine how the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\) interacts with this dynamic over time.\n\nIf a transformation by multiplying with another function \\\\( h(t) = e^{-i\\\\alpha t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant, is applied as an intervention at some point, will the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) at T > t1 (after intervention) reflect changes due to both the original \\\\( z \\\\) and the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by introducing a new frequency component, shifting the entire spectrum of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\). This shift affects the Fourier transform resulting in a different output encompassing both the effects of the original system dynamics and the intervention.",
