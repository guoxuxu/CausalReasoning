  "Problem": "The system is governed by a complex function where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves over time according to the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz\\\\), with A being a real scalar. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{iBs} z(s) ds \\\\), where B is also a real scalar, is analyzed for its effects on the system over time interval [0, T].\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is computed at the beginning and the result is used as the initial condition, will the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from t = 0 to T follow the same trajectory as if \\\\( z(0) \\\\) was directly used under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz\\\\) without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) fundamentally alters the initial state, integrating over a path dependent on B, thus changing the trajectory from what would occur if the initial condition were solely \\\\( z(0) \\\\). The dynamics dictated by \\\\( B \\\\) are different from those solely by \\\\( A \\\\), impacting the trajectory.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation T(z) at t=0 influences the initial condition of z(t), which in turn affects the subsequent behavior of z(t) over time. Directly using z(0) as the initial condition results in a different trajectory compared to using T(z) as the initial condition."
