  "Problem": "Consider an electrical network where the voltage across a circuit element is governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( V(s) = H(s)I(s) \\\\), where \\\\( H(s) \\\\) represents the complex impedance of the element and \\\\( I(s) \\\\) is the transformed input current. The effect of an intervention by adding a parallel impedance \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) to the system is studied.\n\nFrom the observed transform-domain voltage \\\\( V(s) \\\\) at any point, can we uniquely determine the original transform-domain current \\\\( I(s) \\\\) when no additional impedance is added?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional modifications to the circuit such as added impedance, \\\\( V(s) \\\\) is directly related to \\\\( I(s) \\\\) by the invariant function \\\\( H(s) \\\\). Hence, one can uniquely recover \\\\( I(s) \\\\) using the inverse of \\\\( H(s) \\\\), assuming \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is not zero or does not introduce ambiguities.",
