  "Problem": "Analyze a system where \\\\(y(t)\\\\) undergoes a Fourier Transform \\\\(F(y)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} y(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt\\\\), giving a transformed function in the frequency domain. Consider effects of an inverse transformation and external modulation by a function \\\\(h(t)\\\\) applied at a specific time.\n\nIf a modulation by a function \\\\(h(t) = e^{iCt}y(t)\\\\), where \\\\(C\\\\) is a constant, is applied at a time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the inverse Fourier Transform at time \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) reveal the only the influences of \\\\(h(t)\\\\) and not inherent characteristics of the original \\\\(y(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Fourier Transform will reveal a signal influenced both by the original characteristics of \\\\(y(t)\\\\) and the modulation \\\\(h(t)\\\\). The additional modulation adjusts, but does not completely mask, the characteristics of \\\\(y(t)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "h(t) → F(y)(ω); y(t) → F(y)(ω); F(y)(ω) → y(t); t_1 → h(t); T > t_1 → inverse(F(y))(t)",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "At time \\(t_1\\), the function \\(h(t)\\) modulates \\(y(t)\\) to create a new function \\(h(t)y(t)\\). This modulation affects the Fourier transform \\(F(y)(\\omega)\\) of the original \\(y(t)\\). When the inverse Fourier transform is performed after time \\(T > t_1\\), it primarily reveals the effects of \\(h(t)\\) rather than the intrinsic properties of \\(y(t)\\)."
