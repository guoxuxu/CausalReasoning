  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\omega z + kz^2 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) are constants. This system is influenced by applying a linear transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = az + b \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants.\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new linear transformation \\\\( S(z) = cz + d \\\\) (where \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\) are complex constants) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on the original differential equation parameters and not on \\\\( a \\\\), \\\\( b \\\\), \\\\( c \\\\), or \\\\( d \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( S(z) \\\\) adds another layer of complexity, affecting the state of the system at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and influencing its subsequent evolution. Since the differential equation includes a quadratic term, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on how both \\\\( T(z) \\\\) and \\\\( S(z) \\\\) have altered the trajectory, especially since these transformations can significantly change the evolution path.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z(t) is directly influenced by the differential equation parameters ω and k, and indirectly through the transformations T(z) and S(z). The endpoint z(T) for T > t1 depends on the initial conditions and the differential equation dynamics, but not specifically on the constants a, b, c, or d of the transformations T(z) and S(z)."
