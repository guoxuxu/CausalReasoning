  "Problem": "Consider a complex function in the form of \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\) where x is a constant complex vector and A is a constant real matrix. We assess the behavior of the function after applying a Laplace transform, defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z(t)) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) begins as \\\\( e^{iAt}x \\\\) at t = 0 and evolves without further intervention under the Laplace transform, will the resulting transform space function \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(z(t)) \\\\) at s = \\\\sigma differ from direct transformation at s = \\\\sigma assuming no initial application of \\\\( e^{iAt} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( e^{iAt} \\\\) affects the function greatly as it introduces oscillatory behavior, which shifts the frequency components in the Laplace domain. Transforming from the beginning with this exponential term changes the resulting function in the transform space compared to if it was not initially applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The presence of \\( e^{iAt} \\) in \\( z(t) \\) affects the form of \\( Z(s) \\) such that when transforming with Laplace transform at \\( s = \\sigma \\), the initial exponential term influences the resulting function \\( Z(s) \\) differently compared to if no initial exponential term were present."
