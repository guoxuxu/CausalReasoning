  "Problem": "Consider a function represented by a complex variable transformation \\\\( w = f(z) = \\frac{1}{z} \\\\). We explore the effects of this function in the context of integral transformations on the complex plane, specifically using the Cauchy Integral Formula.\n\nDoes the integral \\\\( \\int_{\\gamma} \\frac{f(z)}{z - z_0} dz \\\\) for a simple closed contour \\\\( \\gamma \\\\) enclosing a point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) change if we apply the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) before evaluating the integral?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\frac{1}{z} \\\\) alters the integrand to \\\\( \\frac{1/z}{z - z_0} = \\frac{1}{z(z - z_0)} \\\\), which changes the nature and possibly the value of the integral, especially in terms of residues and singularities within the contour.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function w = 1/z transforms the integrand, changing it from 1/(z - z_0) to f(z)/(z - z_0), which then affects the value of the integral. The contour γ determines the path of integration and influences the evaluated integral."
