  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equations \\\\( z = x + iy \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = -y + x(x^2 + y^2) \\\\), \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = x + y(x^2 + y^2) \\\\) representing a complex function in the form of a dynamical system, where i is the imaginary unit. This system exhibits characteristics of non-linear dynamics and could be subject to transformations using integral techniques like Laplace transform.\n\nIf a new operation like a Fourier transform is applied to the boundary condition at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will this intervention wholly dictate the evolution of the system past \\\\( t_1 \\\\) overshadowing any previous system dynamics or transformations?",
  "Explanation": "While the Fourier transform influences the subsequent system dynamics by altering how frequencies interact, the underlying non-linear characteristics dictated by the original differential equations still play a crucial role in determining the overall system behavior along with any previously applied transformations like the Laplace transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
