  "Problem": "Consider a dynamical system where the stock price follows a stochastic differential equation \\\\( dS = S(\\\\mu dt + \\\\sigma dW) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\) is the drift rate, \\\\( \\\\sigma \\\\) the volatility, and \\\\( dW \\\\) a Brownian motion increment. We apply a Fourier transform \\\\( F(f) \\\\) to transform the probability density function of the stock price.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( F(f) \\\\) is applied to the initial probability density at time t = 0 and evolved under its natural stochastic dynamics \\\\( dS = S(\\\\mu dt + \\\\sigma dW) \\\\) without further intervention, will the characteristic function at time T be the same as if it was directly evolved?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the Fourier transform alters the form of the probability distribution from a time-domain representation to a frequency-domain representation. The subsequent evolution under the stochastic differential equation affects this transformed state in a manner distinct from the direct evolution of the probability density function, leading to different characteristics at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The stochastic dynamics of the stock price (dS → S(μdt + σdW)) directly cause the evolution of the characteristic function (F(f)). Applying the Fourier transform initially (dS → F(f)) and allowing the stock price to evolve naturally under its stochastic dynamics (S(μdt + σdW) → F(f)) will result in the same characteristic function at any time T, assuming no additional interventions."
