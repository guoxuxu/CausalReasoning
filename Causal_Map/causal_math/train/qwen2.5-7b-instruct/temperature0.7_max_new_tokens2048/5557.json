  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where the state of a system z(t) is transformed by a complex function \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(A-iB)s} z(s) ds \\\\), where A and B are matrices, and i is the imaginary unit. This system's behavior under temporal evolution is governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) where C is another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied initially to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and the system is then evolved according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) until time T, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be identical to the scenario where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was just evolved under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) for the same time period?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition through integration involving both A and B. This initial modification, which introduces complex exponential dynamics, changes the trajectory of the system, making \\\\( z(T) \\\\) different compared with straightforward evolution under C.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation h(z) to the initial state z_0 at t=0 and then evolving the system with C → z(t) for time T results in a different z(T) than directly evolving z_0 under C → z(t) for the same duration."
