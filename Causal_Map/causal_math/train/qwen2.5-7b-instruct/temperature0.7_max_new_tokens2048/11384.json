  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output is governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{i\\\\omega s} x(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is the input signal, and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore how the application of a Laplace Transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{x(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} x(t) dt \\\\), affects the signal analysis over time.\n\nGiven the final output \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine unequivocally the original signal and the interventions used (whether a Laplace Transform, Inverse Laplace Transform, or both), solely by analyzing the output at time \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could potentially result from varying initial signals and transformations, considering the irreversible nature of some information loss during transformations and the complex operations involved in these integral and inverse integral transformations. It's therefore impossible to unambiguously identify both the initial conditions and the specific transformations used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "x(t) → z(T); Laplace Transform → transformed_signal; Inverse Laplace Transform → original_signal; transformed_signal → z(T); original_signal → z(T)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input signal x(t) directly influences the output z(T) through the integral transformation. Applying the Laplace Transform to x(t) results in a transformed_signal which also directly influences z(T). Conversely, the original_signal derived from applying the Inverse Laplace Transform to the transformed_signal also directly influences z(T)."
