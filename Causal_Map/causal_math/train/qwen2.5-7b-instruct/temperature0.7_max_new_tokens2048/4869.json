  "Problem": "Let's consider a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + \\\\omega^2 x = 0\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the angular frequency. We explore the system's response under the transformation \\\\(g(x) = e^{kt}x\\\\) for a constant k.\n\nIf transformation \\\\(g(x)\\\\) is applied at time t = 0 to an initial condition \\\\(x_0\\\\), and then the system is allowed to evolve according to its natural dynamics without further intervention, will the oscillator’s behavior at a later time T be identical to if \\\\(x_0\\\\) were simply allowed to evolve naturally under the given differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\(g(x) = e^{kt}x\\\\) initially modifies the amplitude of the oscillator. As time progresses, this change in initial amplitude differentially scales the solution to the oscillator's differential equation, resulting in a differently amplitude-modulated oscillation compared to the natural evolution of \\\\(x_0\\\\) under \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + \\\\omega^2 x = 0\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "k → g(x); t → g(x); x0 → g(x); t → x; ω → x; x0 → x; k → T; T → x",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of x at time T depends on the initial condition x0, the transformation parameter k, the angular frequency ω, and the elapsed time T. Applying the transformation g(x) at t=0 changes x0 to g(x0), and the system evolves according to the differential equation from that point onward."
