  "Problem": "Consider a Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) defined as \\\\(F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt\\\\). We are examining the effects of a subsequent operation using the Laplace Transform \\\\( L(s) \\\\) of a modified function \\\\( g(t) = e^{at}f(t) \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\) are complex numbers.\n\nCan we determine the exact values of the parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) used in the operations from the final Laplace Transform outcome of \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the overlap in effects between different parameter settings in the exponential terms, multiple combinations of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) can potentially yield the same final transform result. Without additional information, it's impossible to pin down the exact values of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) used in the transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map_integration": "The function f(t) Fourier transforms to F(ω), the modified function g(t) is obtained by multiplying f(t) with e^(at), and g(t)'s Laplace transform L(s) depends on the value of a."
