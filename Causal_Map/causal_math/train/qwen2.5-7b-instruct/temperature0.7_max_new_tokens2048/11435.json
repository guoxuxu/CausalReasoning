  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(g(z)\\\\) given by \\\\(g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z^t \\\\, dt\\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex number. We analyze the implications of varying the parameter \\\\(s\\\\) in the function and its effect on the transformation of input complex number \\\\(z\\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\(s\\\\) to \\\\(s + \\\\delta\\\\) at time \\\\(t = t_1\\\\) during the computation of \\\\(g(z)\\\\), does the final computed value of \\\\(g(z)\\\\) only depend on the new value of \\\\(s + \\\\delta\\\\) and not on the original \\\\(s\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final value of \\\\(g(z)\\\\) depends on both the original \\\\(s\\\\) and the intervened value \\\\(s + \\\\delta\\\\). This is because the integral computed up to \\\\(t_1\\\\) is influenced by the original \\\\(s\\\\), and only the remaining part of the integral from \\\\(t_1\\\\) to \\\\(\\\\infty\\\\) is affected by \\\\(s + \\\\delta\\\\). Therefore, both parameters influence the overall result.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
