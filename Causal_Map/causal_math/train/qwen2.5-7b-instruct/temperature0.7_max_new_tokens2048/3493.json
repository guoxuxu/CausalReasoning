  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and let the transformation be defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\int_0^T e^{i\\theta t} z(t) \\, dt \\\\), with \\\\( \\theta \\\\) being another real constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over the interval [0, T] without intervention, will the result of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) be independent of the choice of \\\\( \\omega \\\\) for any T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) depends on the frequency components of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), specifically on how \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\theta \\\\) relate. The integral results in a value that varies with \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\theta \\\\), affecting the outcome based on the integral's sensitivity to these parameters.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of ω does not directly influence the result of f(z) for any given T, as f(z) depends on the integral of e^(iθt)z(t) over [0, T], where z(t) = e^(iωt) and θ is another constant."
