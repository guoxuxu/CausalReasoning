  "Problem": "Consider the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z\\\\), where \\( \\\\omega \\) is a real constant and \\( z \\) represents a complex function. Investigating the influence of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{at}z \\\\) where \\( a \\) is a real constant.\n\nIf transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system evolves as per \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z\\\\) up to t = T without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be identical to the output had \\\\( z_0 \\\\) merely evolved for T under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial modification by \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at t = 0 fundamentally alters the trajectory of evolution. \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) changes the magnitude of the initial condition, thus modifying how \\\\( z \\\\) develops through time under the influence of \\\\( i \\\\omega \\\\), leading to a different state at t = T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation f(z) = e^(at)z directly causes z to change over time, with a → dz/dt, ω → dz/dt, and z → z(T). Applying f(z) to z_0 at t=0 and evolving under dz/dt = iωz up to t=T results in z(T) being equivalent to the evolution of z_0 under the same differential equation for T."
