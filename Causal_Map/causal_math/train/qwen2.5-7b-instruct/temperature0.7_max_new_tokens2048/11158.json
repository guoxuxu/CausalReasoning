  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) governed by the Cauchy-Riemann equations, and an integral transformation \\( T(z) = \\int_{0}^{t} e^{-st} z(s) \\, ds \\) where \\( s \\) is a complex parameter.\n\nCan the original function \\( z_0(t) \\) be deduced from observing \\( T(z(t)) \\) at \\( t = T \\) without knowing the parameter \\( s \\) in \\( T(z) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the complex parameter \\( s \\), the contribution of \\( e^{-st} \\) to the integration cannot be accurately reversed, hence \\( z_0(t) \\) cannot be uniquely reconstructed from \\( T(z(t)) \\) at \\( t = T \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
