  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator. We examine the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(F(u)\\\\) to the initial condition \\\\(u_0\\\\), identifying how this transformed state evolves over time.\n\nCan we precisely identify the transformations used (whether \\\\(F(u)\\\\) initially, \\\\(G(u)\\\\) as intervention, or both) by only analyzing the state \\\\(u(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\(u(T)\\\\) can emerge from various combinations of transformations and evolution under \\\\(L\\\\). The overlapping effects of \\\\(F\\\\) and \\\\(G\\\\) and their interaction with \\\\(L\\\\) create ambiguities, preventing a unique identification of the interventions based solely on the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Fourier transform F(u) to the initial condition u_0 and possibly an intervention G(u) both result in the state u(T) at time T."
