  "Problem": "Analyze the effects of a function \\( h(z) = e^{i\\omega t}z \\) on a complex variable \\( z \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = kz \\), where \\( k \\) is a complex constant, and \\( \\omega \\) is a real number representing angular frequency.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0 after observing \\( z(t) \\) at t = T without knowing whether \\( h(z) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without prior knowledge of whether \\( h(z) \\) was applied (involving the specific value of \\( \\omega \\)), it is impossible to uniquely determine \\( z_0 \\). The transformation \\( e^{i\\omega T} \\) could have altered \\( z_0 \\) in such a way that any reconstructed \\( z_0 \\) from \\( z(T) \\) might represent multiple potential initial conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of z with respect to time is directly influenced by k, while h(z) transforms z through multiplication by a complex exponential, affecting its phase but not its magnitude if k equals the real part of h(z)."
