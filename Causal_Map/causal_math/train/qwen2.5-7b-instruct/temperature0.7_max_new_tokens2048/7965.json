  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a constant matrix. We analyze the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{C\\\\tau}x d\\\\tau \\), where C is another constant matrix over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( T(x) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T(x) \\\\) modifies the initial condition by an integration process incorporating the exponential matrix \\\\( e^{C\\\\tau} \\\\). This transformation fundamentally alters the trajectory of the system from what a pure exponential growth under D alone would have dictated.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the integral transformation T(x) to x_0 results in x(t), which then evolves under the differential equation D → x(t) to produce x(T). This process is compared to directly evolving x_0 to t = T under the same differential equation D → x(t)."
