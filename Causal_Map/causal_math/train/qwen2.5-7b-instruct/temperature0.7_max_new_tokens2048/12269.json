  "Problem": "Consider a linear functional transformation operating on functions \\\\( g(t) \\\\) defined in the complex domain. The transformation is described by the integral transform \\\\( G(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}g(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number. We are interested in analyzing the effect of an intervention function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), where the transformed function becomes \\\\( g'(t) = g(t)h(t) \\\\).\n\nAfter observing the transformed outcome \\\\( G'(s) \\\\), can we determine if \\\\( h(t) \\\\) was applied to the original function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional data on the nature of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) or the original function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), it's impossible to uniquely attribute changes in \\\\( G'(s) \\\\) to the intervention of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) due to the potential variety of other transformations or alterations that could produce similar effects.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function g(t) transforms into G(s) through the integral transform. When h(t) is applied to g(t), resulting in g'(t), G(s) changes to G'(s). The application of h(t) directly causes the change from G(s) to G'(s)."
