  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear operator. Examine the effect of a transformation \\\\( f(u) = u + ke^{Mt} \\\\), where k is a constant vector and M is a constant matrix, on the solution u(t) over time.\n\nCan we precisely determine what interventions were executed (whether \\\\( f(u) \\\\), \\\\( g(u) \\\\), or both), only from knowing \\\\( u(T) \\\\) at some later time T?",
  "Explanation": "Given the endpoint \\\\( u(T) \\\\), it is not possible to unambiguously identify the interventions used, as different combinations of \\\\( f(u) \\\\) and \\\\( g(u) \\\\) might lead to similar or identical outcomes at time T. The overlap in potential state trajectories rendered by matrix exponentials complicates identifying specific interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
