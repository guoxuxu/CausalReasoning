  "Problem": "Consider a wave equation governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) represents the displacement and c is the wave speed. The medium through which the wave travels undergoes a transformation defined by a damping factor \\\\( e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\), \\\\( g(u) \\\\), or both), only by observing the displacement at \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Different combinations of damping and scaling can yield equivalent displacement profiles at time T depending on their values and interaction. The effects of these transformations may not be individually distinguishable purely based on the final state due to potential compensatory effects between \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The wave speed c and the damping factor α directly influence the displacement u(x,t). The displacement at time T, u(x,T), determines the endpoint."
