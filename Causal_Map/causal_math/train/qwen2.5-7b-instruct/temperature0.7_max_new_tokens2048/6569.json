  "Problem": "In a complex function framework, consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant. We examine the effects of applying a linear transformation \\\\( z \\mapsto Az \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a non-zero complex constant, and the implications of further transformations.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( z \\mapsto Az \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without additional interventions, will the state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T differ from the scenario where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was solely evolved under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation by \\\\( A \\\\) modifies the initial condition from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( Az_0 \\\\). Since the system's evolution equation scales the amplitude and rotates the phase, starting from \\\\( Az_0 \\\\) instead of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) results in a different \\\\( z(T) \\\\), scaled and potentially with different phase depending on the nature of \\\\( A \\\\).",

List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state z_0, the transformation factor A, and the constant ω each directly cause the state z(t) at time t. The application of A to z_0 before evolving under ω results in a different z(t) compared to evolving z_0 alone under ω."
