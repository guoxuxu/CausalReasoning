  "Problem": "In a control system, the state vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\) evolves according to the linear system \\\\( \\\\dot{x}(t) = Dx(t) + u(t) \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a control input. A transformation is applied defined by \\\\( h(x) = e^{Ft}x(t) \\\\), where \\\\( F \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new control input \\\\( v(t) \\\\) is introduced as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on D and not on F or the nature of \\\\( v(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a new control input \\\\( v(t) \\\\) as an intervention will alter the system's path, making the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) dependent not just on \\\\( D \\\\) but also on \\\\( F \\\\) (owing to its influence on the initial transformation) and the specifics of \\\\( v(t) \\\\). The system’s final state is consequently influenced by all these factors.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state vector x(t) is directly influenced by the control input u(t), the system matrix D, and the new control input v(t) up to time t_1. After t_1, x(t) continues to evolve based on D but is no longer directly affected by u(t) or v(t). The transformation e^(Ft) affects the representation of x(t) but not its evolution after t_1."
