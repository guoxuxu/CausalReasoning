  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit modeled by complex function \\(\\Omega(z) = \\frac{1}{LCz^2 + RCz + 1}\\), where \\(L\\), \\(C\\), and \\(R\\) are inductance, capacitance, and resistance respectively. The response of the circuit is analyzed under the input transformation given by Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\} = F(s) \\).\n\nGiven the output \\( Y(T) \\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\( F(s) \\), \\( G(s) \\), or both), only by knowing the output value of \\( Y(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The observed output \\( Y(T) \\) could result from various combinations and sequences of transformations \\( F(s) \\) and \\( G(s) \\). Due to the complexity and non-linear interactions between these functions alongside \\( \\Omega(s) \\), pinpointing a specific sequence or set of interventions is impossible without additional information about system behavior during the response.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace transforms F(s) and G(s) both influence the output Y(T) through the circuit's transfer function."
