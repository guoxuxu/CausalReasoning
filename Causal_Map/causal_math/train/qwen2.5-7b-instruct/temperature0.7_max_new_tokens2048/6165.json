  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z \\\\) defined in the complex plane as \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), which represents a unit circle parametrized by time t. Analyze how the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) \\\\), is influenced by the introduction of a phase shift \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) in the function, defined as \\\\( f(z) = e^{i(t + \\\\phi)} \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0, changing it to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i(t + \\\\phi)} \\\\), and the system is observed over time without further modification, will the Laplace transform at a point s change from what it would have been without the phase shift?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing a phase shift modifies the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) fundamentally, thereby altering its Laplace transform. The transform of \\\\( e^{i(t + \\\\phi)} \\\\) results in a function shifted in the s-domain relative to the original, thus impacting the Laplace transform outcome.",
