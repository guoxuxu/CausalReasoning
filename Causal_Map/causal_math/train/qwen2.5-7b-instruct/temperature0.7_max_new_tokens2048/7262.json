  "Problem": "Assume there is a function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + c \\\\) where \\\\( z \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\) are complex numbers. This function is applied iteratively in the context of complex dynamics, commonly used in generating Julia sets.\n\nGiven the final state in a sequence \\\\( z_n \\\\) for some large \\\\( n \\\\), and knowing the function form, can we uniquely ascertain the initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since multiple initial values \\\\( z_0 \\\\) can potentially generate the same or indistinguishably close values of \\\\( z_n \\\\) in complex dynamics, it is generally not possible to backtrack uniquely to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial value z_0 and the constant c together determine the final state z_n through repeated application of the function f(z) = z^2 + c."
