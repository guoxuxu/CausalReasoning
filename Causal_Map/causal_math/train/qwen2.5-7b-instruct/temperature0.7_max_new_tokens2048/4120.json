  "Problem": "Consider a linear system where the temperature distribution \\\\(T(x,t)\\\\) along a rod evolves according to the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\) where k is the thermal diffusivity. We analyze the effect of an intervention defined by a change in boundary conditions from \\\\(T(0, t) = T_0\\\\) (a constant temperature) to an impulse response \\\\(T(0, t) = T_0 + \\\\delta(t)\\\\) at a specific time.\n\nGiven the observed temperature distribution at \\\\(x=L, T\\\\), can we determine unequivocally whether an impulse response was applied at \\\\(x=0, t=0\\\\) or if the boundary was held constantly at \\\\(T_0\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Temperature readings at a single location \\\\(x=L\\\\) without additional context or simultaneous monitoring at other points do not provide sufficient information to definitively ascertain the type of boundary condition applied at \\\\(x=0\\\\). Multiple scenarios could lead to similar temperature distributions at \\\\(x=L\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "An impulse response at the boundary (T(0, t) = T_0 + δ(t)) directly causes a different temperature distribution (T(x, t)) compared to holding the boundary at a constant temperature (T(0, t) = T_0)."
