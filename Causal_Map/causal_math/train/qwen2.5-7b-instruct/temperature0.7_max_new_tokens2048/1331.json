  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We evaluate the effect of transformation by another function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) on the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 = \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2} \\\\), another function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(\\\\pi) \\\\) be influenced solely by the original function without accounting for \\\\( f(z) \\\\) or \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) changes the state of the system at \\\\( t_1 = \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2} \\\\), making the endpoint \\\\( z(\\\\pi) \\\\) influenced by the initial function, the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\), and the intervention \\\\( g(z) \\\\). The complex functions \\\\( z^2 \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) alter magnitudes and/or phases, contributing to a distinct final state at \\\\( t = \\\\pi \\\\).",
