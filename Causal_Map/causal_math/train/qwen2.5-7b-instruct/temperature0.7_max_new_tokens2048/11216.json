  "Problem": "Consider a system in a complex plane characterized by the Cauchy-Riemann equations, which must hold for a function \\\\( f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) \\\\) to be analytic in a region. Let \\\\( T \\\\) represent a transformation where \\\\( T(z) = z^2 \\\\) and explore this transformation's effect on the analytic properties of \\\\( f \\\\).\n\nIs it possible to precisely reverse-engineer the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) based on the knowledge of the transformed and intervened output \\\\( f'(T(z)) = f(z^2) + cz^6 \\\\), knowing the interventions?",
  "Explanation": "While the form of the intervention \\\\( cz^6 \\\\) is known and the transformation \\\\( z^2 \\\\) is clear, the base function \\\\( f \\\\) itself might have multiple possible forms due to the arbitrary constants and the non-uniqueness in the roots when reversing \\\\( z^2 \\\\) (e.g., square roots yielding ± values).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "u(x, y) → f(z); v(x, y) → f(z); T(z) → f'(z); c → f'(z)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The real part u(x, y) and imaginary part v(x, y) of the original function f(z) determine f(z). The transformation T(z) = z^2 maps z to z^2, and the intervention parameter c modifies f(z^2) to produce f'(z^2)."
