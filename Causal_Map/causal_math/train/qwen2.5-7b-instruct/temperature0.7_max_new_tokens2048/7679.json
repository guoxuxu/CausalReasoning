  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where the function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}x\\\\) defines a transformation in the complex plane, with \\\\(x\\\\) as an initial complex number and \\\\(\\omega\\\\) as a real constant frequency. We explore the effects of the Fourier transform \\\\(\\mathcal{F}\\\\) on this function and the implications on the frequency-domain representation.\n\nIf the function is modified at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) by applying a scaling transformation \\\\(g(t) = e^{\\alpha t}\\\\) before taking the Fourier transform, will the frequency peak in the Fourier transform still occur at \\\\(\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The scaling transformation modifies the amplitude of the function but does not affect the frequency of the original signal. Therefore, the peak in the Fourier frequency spectrum will remain at \\\\(\\omega\\\\), albeit with a potentially different amplitude and spread due to the exponential growth factor.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial complex number x and the frequency ω determine z(t), which is then scaled by g(t) to become h(t). The scaling transformation g(t) applied at time t_1 modifies h(t), and the Fourier transform of h(t) still reflects the original frequency ω."
