  "Problem": "Consider a complex system governed by the equation \\\\(z'(t) = iAz(t)\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) denotes the imaginary unit, and \\\\(A\\\\) is a real constant matrix. We are examining the role of the operator \\\\(T(z) = e^{Bt}z(t)\\\\), where \\\\(B\\\\) is another constant matrix, in transforming the state of the system over time.\n\nCan we precisely determine which transformations (\\\\(T(z)\\\\), \\\\(U(z)\\\\), or both) were applied just by examining the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of interventions with \\\\(T(z)\\\\) and \\\\(U(z)\\\\) could lead to the same final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) due to the overlapping influences and non-uniqueness created by the matrix exponentials. Without additional distinct data, the specific transformations used cannot be uniquely resolved.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
