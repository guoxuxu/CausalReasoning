  "Problem": "Consider a set of complex functions defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega_0 t}z_0 \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial state in the complex plane. We assess the system's behavior under the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{kz} \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{-kz} \\\\) is introduced as an intervention, does the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) solely depend on \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) and not on \\\\( k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The interaction of the transformations \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) alters the initial condition and thus the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), through the non-trivial coupling of the exponential parameters. This means the endpoint will be affected by both \\\\( k \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "z_0 → z(t); ω_0 → z(t); k → f(z); k → g(z); z(t_1) → z(T)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state z_0 and angular frequency ω_0 determine z(t), while the constants k in transformations f(z) and g(z) affect intermediate states but do not influence the final state z(T) for T > t_1 once the interventions cease."
