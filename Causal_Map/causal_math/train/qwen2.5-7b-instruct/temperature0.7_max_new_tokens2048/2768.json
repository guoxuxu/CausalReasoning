  "Problem": "Assess a dynamic system governed by partial differential equation \\\\(u_{xx} + u_{yy} + \\lambda u = 0\\\\) defined over a domain \\\\(D\\\\) with boundary conditions. Consider an integral transform \\\\(T(u) = \\int_D e^{-\\lambda xy} u(x, y) \\, dx \\, dy\\\\) and its impact on the solution \\\\(u\\\\).\n\nBased on the knowledge of the state \\\\(u(T)\\\\) at a later time \\\\(T\\\\), is it possible to establish definitively whether either transformation \\\\(T\\\\), \\\\(S\\\\), or both were applied during the evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact history of interventions uniquely just by analyzing the state at \\\\(T\\\\) is not possible. The effects of transformations \\\\(T\\\\) and \\\\(S\\\\), especially when combined with the diffusion and interaction terms of the partial differential equation, can create multiple possible histories leading to the same observed endpoint \\\\(u(T)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The integral transform T applied to u results in the state of u at time T; similarly, the transform S applied to u also results in the state of u at time T."
