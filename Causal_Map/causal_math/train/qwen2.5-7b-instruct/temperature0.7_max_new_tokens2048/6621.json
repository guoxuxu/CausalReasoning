  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u) \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a differential operator. We evaluate the impact of an initial condition transformation described by \\\\( g(u) = \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}(e^{kt}\\\\mathcal{F}(u)) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is the Fourier transform and k is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(u) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u) \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation \\\\( g(u) \\\\) modifies the frequency components of \\\\( u_0 \\\\), potentially altering how these components evolve under the operator \\\\( L \\\\). The changes in the frequency domain due to \\\\( e^{kt} \\\\) result in a different state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of g(u) to u0 directly influences u(t) through the transformation process, while u0 directly influences u(t) through its evolution under the PDE. The constant k influences g(u) which in turn affects u(t), and the differential operator L(u) directly causes the evolution of u(t) over time."
