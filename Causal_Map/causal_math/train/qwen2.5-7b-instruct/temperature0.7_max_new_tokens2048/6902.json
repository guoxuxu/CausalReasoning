  "Problem": "Let's consider a function \\( z = h(x, y) \\) given by \\( z = x^2 + y^2 \\) in a two-dimensional space. We examine the role of a Fourier transform, denoted as \\( \\mathcal{F} \\), applied to \\( h(x, y) \\) defined by \\( H(u, v) = \\mathcal{F}\\{h(x, y)\\}(u, v) \\) and analyze its effect in the frequency domain.\n\nBy observing the transformed function \\( H(u, v) \\) in the frequency domain, can we deduce the exact original function \\( h(x, y) \\) without knowing the specific transformation applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without precise knowledge of the Fourier transform parameters and any additional operations applied in the frequency domain, it is impossible to accurately deduce \\( h(x, y) \\) from \\( H(u, v) \\). Information loss or modification through the transformation process can impede exact reconstruction of the original function.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Fourier transform to the function h(x, y) results in the transformed function H(u, v) in the frequency domain; the inverse Fourier transform allows us to recover h(x, y) from H(u, v)."
