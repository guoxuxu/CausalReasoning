  "Problem": "Consider a function \\(h(z) = \\frac{1}{z}\\) in the complex plane and its transformation under the integral \\( I[h] = \\int_{\\gamma} h(z) \\, dz \\) along a contour \\( \\gamma \\). The contour \\( \\gamma \\) is relevant as it defines the effect of \\( h \\) after transformation via path integral.\n\nIf the contour \\( \\gamma \\) encloses the pole at \\( z = 0 \\), will the integral \\( I[h] \\) be the same as if \\( \\gamma \\) did not enclose any pole?",
  "Explanation": "The integral of \\(h(z)\\) over a contour enclosing a pole includes contributions from the residues at those poles. Since \\( \\gamma \\) encloses the pole at \\(z=0\\), the integral \\(I[h]\\) will include the residue at \\(z=0\\), which alters the result from when no poles are enclosed.",
