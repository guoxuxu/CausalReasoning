  "Problem": "We analyze a heat equation \\(\\partial u/\\partial t = \\alpha \\partial^2 u/\\partial x^2\\) for a rod initially subject to a temperature distribution \\(u(x, 0) = \\sin(\\pi x)\\) with \\(\\alpha > 0\\). Let's evaluate the effects of applying a Fourier sine transform \\(\\mathcal{F}_s\\) which flips the sine component.\n\nAfter observing \\(u(x, t)\\) at a later time \\(T\\), can we distinguish whether the Fourier sine transform \\(\\mathcal{F}_s\\) was applied at \\(t = 0\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\(\\mathcal{F}_s(u(x, 0))\\) retains the initial condition as \\(\\sin(\\pi x)\\), the temperature distribution \\(u(x, t)\\) evolved under the heat equation does not reveal whether \\(\\mathcal{F}_s\\) was applied, as it results in the same state evolution.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial temperature distribution u(x, 0) directly influences u(x, t). Applying a Fourier sine transform to the initial condition u(x, 0) results in a transformed initial condition transformed_u(x, 0), which then directly influences u(x, t)."
