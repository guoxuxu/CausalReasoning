  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We examine the role of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) \\\\) which converts the function u(x, t) into its frequency components \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t)\\\\).\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a filtering process \\\\( \\\\mathcal{H}(\\\\hat{u}) = h(k)\\\\hat{u} \\\\) (where \\\\( h(k) \\\\) represents a filter in the frequency domain) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on L and not on the initial Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the filter \\\\( h(k) \\\\) modifies the frequency components directly, which alters the progression under the operator L. Therefore, the state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) depends not only on L but also significantly on the nature of the filter applied, even if the initial condition was transformed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state u(x, t1) influences the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t1)\\\\), which then evolves over time under the action of the differential operator L and the filter h(k) to determine \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\). Thus, \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) depends on L, h(k), and the initial Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t1)\\\\)."
