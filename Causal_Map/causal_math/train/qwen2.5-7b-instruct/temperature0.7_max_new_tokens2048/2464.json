  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving over time based on the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\) where M is a complex constant matrix. The behavior of the system under the influence of the integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{N \\\\tau} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), with N being another complex matrix, is examined.\n\nCan we definitively decide on what specific transformations or interventions (\\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( U(z) \\\\), either, or both) have been applied over the period 0 to T based solely on the end resulting observation of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) might be the outcome of several potential intervention combinations due to overlaps in the effects and path-dependent processes. Without explicit knowledge of the interventions, multiple scenarios could theoretically lead to the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\), making it impossible to determine uniquely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of z(t) over time is driven by Mz, and the integral transformation T(z) accumulates this effect from 0 to t, ultimately influencing the value of z(T)."
