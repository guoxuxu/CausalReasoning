  "Problem": "Consider a physical system governed by the wave equation in a one-dimensional domain, defined as \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) describes the displacement at position \\\\( x \\\\) and time \\\\( t \\\\), and \\\\( c \\\\) is the wave speed. We explore the effect of applying the Fourier transform to the initial conditions.\n\nIf an intervention changes the wave speed \\\\( c \\\\) to a new value at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the Fourier-transformed state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be independent of the original wave speed?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the wave speed alters the rate of propagation of each frequency component in the wave equation. The final state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,T) \\\\) depends on both the original and the new wave speeds, as these influence the cumulative phase and amplitude changes in the Fourier domain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
