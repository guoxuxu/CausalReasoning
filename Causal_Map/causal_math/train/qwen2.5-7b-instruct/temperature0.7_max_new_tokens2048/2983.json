  "Problem": "Imagine a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) defined on the complex plane, where \\\\( z(x) = e^{iAx} \\\\) and A is a complex matrix. The function undergoes a Laplace transform, resulting in \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{e^{iAx}\\\\}(s) \\\\. Furthermore, an intervention by a matrix operator \\\\( M \\\\) is applied intermittently, transforming \\\\( z(x) \\\\) into \\\\( Mz(x) \\).\n\nIf at some point \\\\( x_1 \\\\), the intervention \\\\( Mz(x) \\\\) is applied, wil the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) still be representative solely of the matrix A by the time it is mapped at any later point?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention at \\\\( x_1 \\\\) by applying M modifies the function from \\\\( e^{iAx} \\\\) to \\\\( Me^{iAx} \\\\). As a result, the Laplace transform now reflects the properties of both A and M, indicated by the altered function expression, which affects the computation and final structure of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An intervention by matrix M transforms z(x) into Mz(x), which then influences Z(s). Initially, z(x) is e^(iAx), and its Laplace transform is Z(s). After applying M, Mz(x) becomes the new input for the Laplace transform, affecting Z(s)."
