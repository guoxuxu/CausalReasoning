  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency. We examine the impact of an integral transformation \\\\(T(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) \\\\, dt\\\\) applied to \\\\(z(t)\\\\) over a period \\\\(T\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is initialized as \\\\(z(0) = 1\\\\) and evolves according to \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), and \\\\(T(z)\\\\) is computed over this evolution without other interventions, will the result of \\\\(T(z)\\\\) be zero?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) is a complex exponential, the integral transformation over a complete period results in zero due to the periodicity and orthogonality properties of the exponential function with respect to integration over a full period. This follows from the properties of Fourier series where integral of a non-zero frequency term over its period is zero.",
