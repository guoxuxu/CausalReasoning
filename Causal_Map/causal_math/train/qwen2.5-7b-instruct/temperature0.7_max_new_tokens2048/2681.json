  "Problem": "Examine a response system governed by the Laplace transform \\(\\mathcal{L}(x(t)) = X(s)\\) of a function \\(x(t)\\). Assume an exponential function \\(f(x) = e^{kx}\\) acts on \\(x(t)\\) and modifies its behaviour in the Laplace domain.\n\nDoes applying the transformation \\(f(x) = e^{kx}\\) to \\(x(t)\\) before taking the Laplace transform alter the transformed function \\(X(s)\\) such that \\(s\\) is replaced with \\(s-k\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\(\\mathcal{L}(e^{kx}x(t))\\) results in a modified Laplace transform where every instance of \\(s\\) is substituted with \\(s-k\\). This represents the frequency domain scaling effect due to exponential time-domain multiplication.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
