  "Problem": "Consider a complex system governed by the equation \\\\(z'(t) = iAz(t)\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) denotes the imaginary unit, and \\\\(A\\\\) is a real constant matrix. We are examining the role of the operator \\\\(T(z) = e^{Bt}z(t)\\\\), where \\\\(B\\\\) is another constant matrix, in transforming the state of the system over time.\n\nIs it possible to exactly infer the initial state \\\\(z(0)\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\) by observing the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\), without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(T(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(T(z)\\\\) was applied, it is impossible to uniquely determine the initial vector \\\\(z(0)\\\\), because the transformation \\\\(e^{Bt}\\\\) might have modified the initial conditions in ways that cannot be exactly reversed without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of z(t) is influenced by iA, and T(z) transforms z(t) over time through e^(Bt). Knowing z(T) does not allow inferring z(0) without information about the transformation parameters A and B."
