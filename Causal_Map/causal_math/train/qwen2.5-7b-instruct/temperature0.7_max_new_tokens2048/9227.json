  "Problem": "Consider a linear system with time evolution defined by the matrix exponential \\\\( y(t) = e^{At}y_0 \\\\), where A is a constant matrix. An operator transformation given by \\\\( f(y) = Cy \\\\) where C is also a constant matrix, is applied as an intervention.\n\nSuppose a second transformation \\\\( g(y) = Dy \\\\) is applied at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) during the system's evolution, will the state \\\\( y(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend exclusively on the matrix A defining the time evolution or also on the matrices C and D?",
  "Explanation": "After applying \\\\( g(y) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the state becomes \\\\( Dy(t_1) \\\\), and the subsequent evolution modifies this state under \\\\( e^{A(T-t_1)} \\\\). Hence, the resulting \\\\( y(T) \\\\) depends on \\\\( C \\\\) (for \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) intervention), \\\\( D \\\\) (for \\\\( t_1 \\\\) intervention), and \\\\( A \\\\). Multiple interventions make the system’s final state influenced by all involved matrices.",
