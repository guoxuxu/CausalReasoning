  "Problem": "Consider a continuous system described by Laplace's equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) in a two-dimensional domain. We analyze the effect of an integral transform, specifically the Fourier transform, applied to the boundary conditions of the domain.\n\nGiven the observed potential function \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\) in the domain, can we conclusively determine the specific transforms applied (Fourier, Laplace, or both) to the boundary conditions from the start?",
  "Explanation": "The potential function resulting from Laplace’s equation could correspond to various combinations of transforms applied to the boundary conditions due to the non-specificity of boundary effects in shaping the interior solutions. Identifying the specific transforms used from the final potential function alone is generally indeterminate without additional boundary data.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
