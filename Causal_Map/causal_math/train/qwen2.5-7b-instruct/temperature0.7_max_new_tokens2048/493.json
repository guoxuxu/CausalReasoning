  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions evolving according to the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant scalar values. We explore the effects of applying a Laplace transformation, defined by \\\\( L(f(t)) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\), on this system.\n\nIf the Laplace transformation \\\\( L(z(t)) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under the original differential equations without further intervention, will the transformed function \\\\( L(z(T)) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the original equations?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transformation alters the function by integrating it over exponentially decaying factors and cannot be simply undone or reversed by evolving under the original differential equations. This transformation changes the function's form and behavior, yielding a different result than direct evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
