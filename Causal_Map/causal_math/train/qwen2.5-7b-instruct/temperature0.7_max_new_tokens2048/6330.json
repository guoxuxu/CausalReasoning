  "Problem": "Let's analyze a control system with state vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\) whose dynamics are governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Px + Qu \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a control input. We observe the effect when transforming the state by function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Mt}x \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nIf we observe the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine the original state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied, and given that \\\\( M \\\\), \\\\( P \\\\), and \\\\( Q \\\\) can significantly alter the trajectories predictably, it's generally impossible to uniquely infer \\\\( x_0 \\\\) due to potential alterations caused by \\\\( h(x) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The control input u(t), through the dynamics defined by P and Q, directly influences the state x(t). The transformation matrix M, through h(x), transforms the state x(t) into x(T). Without applying h(x), the original state x_0 at t=0 cannot be uniquely determined from x(T) alone."
