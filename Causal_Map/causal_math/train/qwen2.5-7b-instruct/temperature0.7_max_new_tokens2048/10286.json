  "Problem": "Analyze the influence of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) on the stability of a linear system defined by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax \\\\), where A is a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the evolved state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) and knowing it resulted from a system defined by \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax \\\\), can we uniquely determine whether the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was multiplied by \\\\( e^{it} \\\\) at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) does not uniquely confirm the initial multiplication by \\\\( e^{it} \\\\), as the influence of A and the exponential complex factor both affect the trajectory. Without additional information about phase changes or specific interactions between A and the exponential terms, \\\\( x(T) \\\\) alone is insufficient for determining initial modifications.",
