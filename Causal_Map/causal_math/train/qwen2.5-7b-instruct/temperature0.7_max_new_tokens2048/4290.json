  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t. We analyze the impact of the transformation given by the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), the observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\) offers insufficient information to uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) due to potential alterations by the rotational factor \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\). The ambiguity arises because the same final state could derive from various rotated initial states.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z at time T (z(T)) is causally influenced by the transformation h applied to z at time 0 (h(z) → z(T)), which in turn depends on the initial value of z at time 0 (z(0) → z_0). The values of x(T) and y(T) are respectively causally influenced by x(t) and y(t) at the same time T (x(T) → x(t); y(T) → y(t))."
