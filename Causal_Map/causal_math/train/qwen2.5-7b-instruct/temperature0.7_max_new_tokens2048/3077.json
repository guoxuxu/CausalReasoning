  "Problem": "In the context of signal processing, consider a system where a signal \\( x(t) \\) passes through a linear time-invariant (LTI) system characterized by its impulse response \\( h(t) \\). We study the causal inference of output \\( y(t) \\) resulting from the Fourier Transform \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) applied to \\( x(t) \\) with frequency representation \\( X(\\omega) = \\mathcal{F}\\{x(t)\\} \\) and similarly \\( Y(\\omega) = \\mathcal{F}\\{y(t)\\} = H(\\omega)X(\\omega) \\), where \\( H(\\omega) \\) is the transfer function of the system.\n\nIf \\( x(t) \\) is transformed by a Fourier Transform and then processed by the LTI system, will \\( y(t) \\) at any later time \\( t \\) necessarily reflect only alterations due to \\( H(\\omega) \\) applied to \\( X(\\omega) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the system is LTI and the transformation is linear, the resulting \\( y(t) \\) only depends on the input \\( X(\\omega) \\) and the system's response \\( H(\\omega) \\). The transformation \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) linearly represents \\( x(t) \\) in the frequency domain where it is directly modified by \\( H(\\omega) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The signal x(t) transforms into its frequency representation X(ω) via the Fourier Transform, which then passes through the LTI system characterized by H(ω), resulting in Y(ω). Therefore, y(t) at any time t is influenced solely by the transformation of x(t) into X(ω) and the filtering effect of H(ω)."
