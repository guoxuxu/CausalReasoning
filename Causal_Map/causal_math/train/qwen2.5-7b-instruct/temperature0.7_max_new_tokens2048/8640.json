  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = re^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( r \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are constants, representing a circular trajectory in the complex plane. Analyze the impact of a transformation implemented by the function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) at time t and its effects on the system.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were made (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), solely by observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from different combinations of transformations and their respective parameter values. The overlap in potential final states arising from the interactions of magnitude and phase modifications makes it challenging to uniquely identify the specific transformations and parameters used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
