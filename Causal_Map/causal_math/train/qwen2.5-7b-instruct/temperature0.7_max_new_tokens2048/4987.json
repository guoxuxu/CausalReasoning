  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear transformation \\\\( L(z) = Cz \\\\) in the complex domain, where C is a constant complex matrix. Analyze the consequences of applying a transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dz}z \\\\) over complex variable z, with D being another constant complex matrix.\n\nAssuming an intervention with another transformation \\\\( k(z) = e^{Ez}z \\\\) (where E is a constant complex matrix) is applied at some midpoint, does the final state of \\\\( z \\\\) depend solely on C and not on D or E?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the intervention \\\\( k(z) \\\\) adds complexity by further modifying the trajectory of \\\\( z \\\\) which now depends on the interaction between C, D, and E. The dynamic response is influenced by the sequential application of exponential transformations, leading to a state dependent on all matrices.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
