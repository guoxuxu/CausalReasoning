  "Problem": "Let's consider a function space defined over the complex plane and explore the effects of complex function transformations based on the function \\\\(g(z) = e^{iw}z\\\\), where \\\\(w\\\\) is a complex constant. We analyze the impact of this transformation on another function \\\\(h(z)\\\\) defined in the same space that evolves under an integral transformation \\\\(H(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} h(z) e^{-ixz} dx\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\(g(z)\\\\) is applied to a complex function \\\\(h(z)\\\\) at time t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the integral transformation \\\\(H(z)\\\\) without further intervention, will the transformed function \\\\(H(g(z))\\\\) at some later time T be equivalent to \\\\(H(h(z))\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(g(z)\\\\) modifies the function \\\\(h(z)\\\\) into \\\\(h(e^{iw}z)\\\\), and when \\\\(H\\\\) is applied to this modified function, the integral transformation will respond differently due to the altered argument of \\\\(h(z)\\\\). The transformation \\\\(e^{iw}z\\\\) causes a shift in the frequency domain, thus altering the output of the integral transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the transformation g(z) to a function h(z) results in a different function H(g(z)) compared to the original function H(h(z)), as H is an integral transformation that depends on the input function."
