  "Problem": "Consider the scenario where a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves in the complex plane under the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We study how the Fourier Transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t)) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\), affects our understanding of the system.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) initially starts as \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and evolves according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without any interventions, will the Fourier Transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any time t reflect changes due solely to the natural evolution of \\\\( z \\\\) under its differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), being a linear integral transform, directly captures how the frequency components of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolve. Since \\\\( z(t) = z_0 e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), the transformation captures this evolution without alteration, reflecting changes due to the differential equation alone.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of z(t) over time, driven by the differential equation, directly influences its Fourier Transform; the initial value z_0 determines the starting point of z(t), and the constant ω dictates the rate of change of z(t)."
