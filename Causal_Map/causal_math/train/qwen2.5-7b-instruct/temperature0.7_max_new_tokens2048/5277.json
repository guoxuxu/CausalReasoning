  "Problem": "Analyze an electrical circuit with an impedance represented by the function \\( Z(s) = \\frac{s^2 + as + b}{s + c} \\) in the Laplace transform domain, where \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are constants. The input to the circuit is a voltage \\( V(s) \\), and the output is current \\( I(s) \\). The response of the circuit is also influenced by an operational amplifier with a Laplace transfer function \\( H(s) = \\frac{1}{s} \\), which can be switched into the circuit as an intervention.\n\nIf the input voltage \\( V(s) \\) increases, will the output current \\( I(s) = \\frac{V(s)}{Z(s)} \\) always increase proportionally without any further intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The proportionality of output current to input voltage depends on the complex function \\( Z(s) \\). Since \\( Z(s) \\) contains polynomial terms in the numerator and denominator, the relationship isn't straightforward and depends on the specific values of \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) as well as the input frequency domain represented by \\( s \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in the input voltage V(s) will generally lead to a change in the output current I(s), which is inversely proportional to the impedance Z(s). The impedance Z(s) is determined by the constants a, b, and c in its function."
