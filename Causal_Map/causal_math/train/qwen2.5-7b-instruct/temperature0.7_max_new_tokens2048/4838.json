  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) that describes a two-dimensional motion, where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The motion is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), with a constant complex matrix \\\\( P \\\\). We explore the impact of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) applied at time t, where \\\\( Q \\\\) is another constant complex matrix.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we infer the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) if we do not know whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), we lack critical information regarding the scaling and rotation imparted by \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\). Different initial conditions could lead to the same final state due to this unknown transformation's effects mixing with the natural \\\\( P \\\\)-induced dynamics.",
