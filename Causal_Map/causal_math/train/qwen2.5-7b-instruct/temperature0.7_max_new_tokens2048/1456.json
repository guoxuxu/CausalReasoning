  "Problem": "Consider a complex function represented as \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a matrix. We analyze the behavior following the Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) applied to the function, altering the complex variable t to a complex frequency domain variable s.\n\nKnowing only the final Laplace transform result \\\\( F(s) \\\\), can the precise matrices A and B (from the original function and the intervention respectively) be determined?",
  "Explanation": "The overlap of influences from matrices A and B and the general non-invertibility of overlapping matrix operations, particularly in transform spaces like those produced by the Laplace transform, render the isolation of A and B from \\\\( F(s) \\\\) ambiguous without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Given the Laplace transform F(s) of the function f(z) = e^(Az), it is possible that F(s) indirectly influences the determination of the matrices A and B, but this depends on additional information about the relationship between A and B."
