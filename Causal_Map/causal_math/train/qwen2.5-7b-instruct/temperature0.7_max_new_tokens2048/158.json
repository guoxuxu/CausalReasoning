  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined on a matrices, \\\\( g(Z) = e^{Z} \\\\), applied to the solution \\\\( X(t) \\\\) of a differential system described by \\\\( \\\\dot{X} = MX + XN \\\\) where M and N are constant matrices. We explore the effects and causation in different scenarios involving this transformation.\n\nCan one determine the initial matrix \\\\( X(0) \\\\) reliably after observing the transformed state \\\\( g(X(T)) \\\\) at time T without knowing the details of the differential equation that was used?",
  "Explanation": "Given the transformed state \\\\( g(X(T)) \\\\) alone, one cannot uniquely determine \\\\( X(0) \\\\) without the specific information of matrices M and N used in the differential equation. The transformation obscures the initial state details due to its non-invertible nature over the space of all matrices.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial matrix X(0) influences g(X(T)), with M and N also affecting g(X(T)) through their roles in determining the evolution of X(t) over time."
