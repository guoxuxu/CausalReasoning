  "Problem": "Investigate a unitary transformation system defined by \\\\(z(t+1) = Uz(t)\\\\) where \\\\(U\\\\) is a unitary matrix and \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is a complex vector. Consider the impact of the transformation \\\\(g(z) = Vz\\\\), where \\\\(V\\\\) is another unitary matrix.\n\nIf at certain time t_1, a new function \\\\(h(z) = Wz\\\\) (where \\\\(W\\\\) is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\(U\\\\) and not on \\\\(V\\\\) or \\\\(W\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(h(z)\\\\) adds another layer of complexity, making the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) dependent not just on the original transformation \\\\(U\\\\) but also affected by both \\\\(V\\\\) and \\\\(W\\\\). As with \\\\(V\\\\), the unitary transformation through \\\\(W\\\\) affects the trajectory of the system leading to a different endpoint based on how these transformations interplay.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The endpoint z(T) depends on U through the iterative transformation z(t+1) = Uz(t), and may be influenced by V and W through initial conditions and interventions, but the direct dependency on z(T) from T > t_1 is solely through U."
