  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{\\\\Gamma} e^{zt} dt \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\( \\\\Gamma \\\\) is a contour in the complex plane. The function is explored under the transformation \\\\( h(z) = iz \\\\), implying a rotation in the complex plane.\n\nGiven the final evaluation of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) after potential interventions of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and/or \\\\( j(z) \\\\), can we definitively determine which transformations were applied?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific transformations used solely based on the output of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is impractical due to the non-linear and non-injective nature of the transformations \\\\( h(z) = iz \\\\) and \\\\( j(z) = -z \\\\). Multiple combinations and orders of applying these transformations could lead to the same final output of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), creating ambiguity in tracing back the specific interventions.",
