  "Problem": "Investigate a system where current flows through an electrical circuit influenced by a complex function transform. The current \\( I(t) \\) is governed by \\( \\dot{I} = -RI + V_0 \\) where \\( R \\) is resistance and \\( V_0 \\) a voltage source. We explore the behavior under the Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{I(t)\\} \\) and its inverse.\n\nIf the Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{I(t)\\} \\) is applied initially and then the system is allowed to evolve according to \\( \\dot{I} = -RI + V_0 \\) without further intervention, will \\( I(t) \\) at any subsequent time \\( t \\) be the same if the transform was never applied?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform is a reversible linear operation affecting only the expression but not the actual physical system behavior. Application and reversal of the Laplace Transform to \\( I(t) \\) do not alter the underlying dynamics described by \\( \\dot{I} = -RI + V_0 \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Resistance R and voltage source V_0 directly cause the current I(t) to change over time according to the differential equation. Applying the Laplace Transform to I(t) does not alter the underlying relationship between R, V_0, and I(t), so the current I(t) at any subsequent time t will be the same regardless of whether the Laplace Transform was applied initially."
