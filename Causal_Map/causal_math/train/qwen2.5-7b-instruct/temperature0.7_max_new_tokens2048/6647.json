  "Problem": "Investigate the interplay between two functions, \\\\( p(z) = z^2 + 1 \\\\) and \\\\( q(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( a \\\\) is a real number, and their effects within the integral transformation \\\\( I[f(z)] = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(z) e^{-z^2} dz \\\\).\n\nIf the function \\\\( q(z) \\\\) is applied as an intervention after \\\\( t_0 \\\\) during the transformation process, will the final outcome only depend on the original function and not on the parameters of \\\\( q(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( q(z) = e^{az} \\\\) introduces exponential growth or decay dependent on \\\\( a \\\\), which will significantly alter the transformed result depending on the value of \\\\( a \\\\). Thus, the final transformation result is sensitive not only to the original function but also to the parameter \\\\( a \\\\) used in \\\\( q(z) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
