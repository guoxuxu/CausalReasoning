  "Problem": "Consider a thermodynamic system where the temperature \\( T \\) inside a reactor is controlled by a function \\( u(t, T) = kT + c \\), where \\( k \\) and \\( c \\) are constants. Here, \\( k \\) represents a proportional control on the temperature, and \\( c \\) is a constant heating term. We explore scenarios applying a linear transformation function \\( v(T) = mT + n \\) where \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are constants, altering \\( T \\) at various instants.\n\nCan we deduce the original temperature \\( T_0 \\) in the reactor at t = 0 after observing \\( T(t) \\) at t = T without knowing whether \\( v(T) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on whether \\( v(T) \\) was applied to adjust \\( T_0 \\), determining the original \\( T_0 \\) solely from the observed \\( T(t) \\) at t = T is not feasible. The transformation \\( mT + n \\) may have shifted the baseline in a non-recoverable way by just observing the outcomes, especially without exact knowledge of the constants m and n.",
