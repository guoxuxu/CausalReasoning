  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\cdot z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant, and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is a complex number representing an initial value in the complex plane. This scenario deals with the evolution of the complex function over time and explores the possible effects of external complex transformations.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\cdot z_0 \\\\) evolves from \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( t = T \\\\) without any external transformation, will adding an initial phase shift \\\\( \\phi \\\\) to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) result in the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\) regardless of the phase shift?",
  "Explanation": "The initial phase shift changes the starting direction of rotation in the complex plane. As \\\\( z(T) = e^{i \\omega T} \\cdot e^{i \\phi} \\cdot z_0 \\\\), this results in a different endpoint due to the shift \\\\( e^{i \\phi} \\\\), leading to a different value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on \\\\( \\phi \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial value z_0 and the angular frequency ω directly cause the evolution of z(t) over time t. An initial phase shift φ modifies z_0 but does not affect the final value z(T) after time T."
