  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined in the z-plane, where z is a complex number, and is given by \\\\( f(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\). We evaluate the effects of a transformation involving a linear operator T applied to the function, where \\\\( T(f(z)) = f'(z) \\\\), the derivative of the function.\n\nIf at a specific point z = b, an intervention alters the function to \\\\( g(z) = e^{z^3} \\\\), and the transformation T is still applied, will the results merely be dependent on the initial transformation T and not the new function g at any point z = c (for \\(c \\neq b\\))?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by changing the original function to \\\\( g(z) = e^{z^3} \\\\) at z = b alters the behavior of the system globally, affecting points beyond z = b. The derivative transformation T applied thereafter affects this new function, yielding different results than just the application of T on \\\\( f(z) \\\\), thus the dependency exists both on the new function and the transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation T applied to a function depends on the function itself; changing from f(z) to g(z) changes the output of T. For z ≠ b, T(f(z)) and T(g(z)) are distinct due to the different forms of f(z) and g(z)."
