  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) in a rod is described by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), with \\\\( k \\\\) being the thermal diffusivity constant. We analyze the consequence of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the system, defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\xi x} u(x,t) dx \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is applied to the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\), and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi, T) \\\\) for a later time T follow the same evolution as predicted by the heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the heat equation leads to a simpler expression in the frequency domain where the system evolves as \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\hat{u}}{\\\\partial t} = -k \\\\xi^2 \\\\hat{u} \\\\). The evolution in the frequency domain is consistent with the heat equation, merely transformed into this new representation.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial temperature distribution u(x,0) evolves over time according to the heat equation to become u(x,t), which, when Fourier transformed, results in F(u)(ξ,t) that also evolves according to the same transformation to become F(u)(ξ,T) at a later time T."
