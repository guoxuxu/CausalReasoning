  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) where A is a complex number. Analyze the mappings when transformed by this exponential function in the complex plane, considering different paths in the complex plane.\n\nGiven the value of \\\\( \\\\int_{C} f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\), can we definitively determine the original path C in the complex plane without knowing the function form?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific knowledge of the function form and how it interacts with the contour, various paths might yield the same integral value, especially when considering how complex exponential functions can behave over different contours.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The integral value depends on the path C in the complex plane and the function f(z), but knowing only the integral value does not uniquely determine the original path C."
