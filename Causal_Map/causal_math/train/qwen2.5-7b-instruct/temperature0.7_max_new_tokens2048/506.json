  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency, under the application of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\mathcal{F} \\\\). The transformation is considered at two intervals: initially at time t = 0 and after applying an intervention \\\\( h(t) = e^{-i\\omega t} \\\\).\n\nGiven the final frequency spectrum at t = T of a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), where you observe a peak at \\\\( \\omega \\\\), can you conclusively state that the initial function at t = 0 was \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) without intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of a peak at frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) in the spectrum at t = T only indicates the frequency component \\\\( \\omega \\\\) at that time; it does not uniquely confirm that the initial state was exactly \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\). Other functions or initial conditions might evolve to the same spectrum at t = T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function z(t) = e^(iωt) directly influences its frequency spectrum, and the intervention h(t) = e^(-iωt) also directly influences the frequency spectrum. Therefore, observing a peak at ω in the final frequency spectrum at t = T does not conclusively indicate that the initial function at t = 0 was e^(iωt) without intervention."
