  "Problem": "Investigate the implications of applying a complex function transformation \\\\( h(x) = x^2 + ci \\\\) to a complex variable \\\\( x(t) \\\\) that evolves over time according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = kx \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant complex number.\n\nGiven the outcome \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we ascertain the exact interventions and transformations (\\\\( h(x) \\\\), \\\\( j(x) \\\\), or both) used only by observing \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining specific interventions from \\\\( x(T) \\\\) alone is infeasible due to the complex number domain's inherent ambiguities and the non-commutative aspect of subsequent transformations and interventions. The overlapping effects and potential for various intervention sequences to lead to similar end states preclude a definitive tracing of the interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of x at time t evolves over time according to the differential equation, then undergoes a transformation by the function h, ultimately determining x at time T. The transformation h(x) depends on the initial value x(t) and the constant complex number c, and the outcome x(T) reflects this process."
