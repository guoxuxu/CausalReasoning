  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( t \\\\) is time. The impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( \\mathcal{F}(z)(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\, dt \\\\) over time is studied, where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z'(t) = e^{i\\omega' t} \\\\) at a certain time, and then \\\\( \\mathcal{F}(z')(s) \\\\) is applied, will the transformation output depend solely on the new frequency \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) and not on the original \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Following the intervention that alters the function to \\\\( z'(t) = e^{i\\omega' t} \\\\), the integral transformation \\\\( \\mathcal{F}(z')(s) \\\\) calculates the Laplace transform based on the modified function. The result will reflect only the properties of \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) and the new frequency \\\\( \\omega' \\\\).",
