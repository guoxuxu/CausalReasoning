  "Problem": "Analyze the system governed by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We examine the role of applying the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), which transforms the spatial variable to a frequency variable.\n\nGiven the state \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\), can we determine precisely what transformations were applied (whether \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\), or both), based solely on the observation of \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the diverse effects that different transformation operations (such as Fourier and Laplace) have on the solution's trajectory in their respective domains, the endpoint \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) does not uniquely reveal which transformations were applied. Various combinations of these transformations can lead to the same final observation owing to their different but potentially compensating effects on the system dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Fourier transform to the state u(x, T) yields u(k, T); the linear differential operator L acting on u(x, 0) results in Lu; the initial condition u(x, 0) influences both u(x, T) and Lu."
