  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a matrix differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a constant matrix. We explore the effects of a transformation defined by the matrix function \\\\( g(x) = e^{Mt}x \\\\) over time t, where M is a different constant matrix.\n\nCan we reconstruct the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(x) \\\\), we are unable to definitively trace back to the original conditions. The matrix exponential \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\) could have configured the initial state in a manner that makes reverse deduction complex or impossible, especially if M is not commutative with D.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of x at time t (x(t)) is influenced by the transformation g(x) which is determined by the matrix M. The rate of change of x over time (Dx) leads to the value of x at any given time t (x(t))."
