  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that solves the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\) in one dimension, where \\\\( k \\\\) is a positive constant representing the diffusion coefficient. We introduce the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) of \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) to investigate its behavior under various scenarios.\n\nGiven the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t)) \\\\), can we determine whether an additional heat source term \\\\( h(x, t) \\\\) was included in the heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "If the Fourier Transform of the solution \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t)) \\\\) deviates from the expected form under the standard heat equation, it implies the presence of additional terms such as \\\\( h(x, t) \\\\). Therefore, the type and effects of intervention can be inferred by analyzing discrepancies between the expected and actual Fourier Transforms.",
