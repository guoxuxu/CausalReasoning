  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) defined on the complex plane, where \\\\(z(t)\\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = z^2 + c\\\\), with \\\\(c\\\\) being a constant complex number. Study the behavior of this system under the integral transformation \\\\(T_c(z) = \\\\int_0^t (z(s) + c) \\\\, ds\\\\), focusing on how \\\\(c\\\\) influences the trajectory.\n\nIf the integral transformation \\\\(T_c(z)\\\\) is applied to \\\\(z(t)\\\\) and the system then evolves according to \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = z^2 + c\\\\) without any further manipulation, will \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at some time \\\\(t = T\\\\) strictly be a function of the initial condition \\\\(z(0)\\\\) and \\\\(c\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Yes, because the system's evolution rule \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = z^2 + c\\\\) and the transformation \\\\(T_c(z)\\\\) are inherently based on the initial state and the constant \\\\(c\\\\). The evolution and resulting state at any \\\\(t = T\\\\) are direct consequences of these initial conditions and the specific system setting.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
