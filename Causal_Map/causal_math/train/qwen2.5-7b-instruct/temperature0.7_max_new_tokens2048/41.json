  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. Analyze the effect of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) on this function and its subsequent inverse transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\) to understand causal relationships.\n\nIf the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\) and then the inverse transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\) is used without any modification, will the resulting function be identical to the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) followed by its inverse transformation directly results in the original function, assuming the region of convergence includes \\\\( a \\\\). This is due to the properties of the Laplace transformation and its ability to perfectly reconstruct the original function from its transform in the absence of any other modifications.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
