  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is described by the convolution integral \\\\( z(t) = (h * x)(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is the input function, and \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is the impulse response of the system represented using the Laplace transform as \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+1} \\\\). We investigate the changes when applying a scaling transformation \\\\( f(x) = kx(t) \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant scalar.\n\nIf the scaling function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is applied to the input \\\\( x(t) \\\\), then left to evolve under the convolution integral without further intervention, will the output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be proportionally scaled by \\\\( k \\\\) at any time t?",
  "Explanation": "Since the system is linear, applying the scaling function \\\\( f(x) = kx(t) \\\\) results in the output scaling directly with \\\\( k \\\\). The convolution of a scaled input with the impulse response will output a scaled response, i.e., \\\\( z(t) = k(h * x)(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying a scaling factor k to the input x(t) through the function f(x) results in a scaled input x'(t) which, when convolved with the impulse response h(t), produces an output z'(t) that is proportionally scaled by k relative to the original output z(t)."
