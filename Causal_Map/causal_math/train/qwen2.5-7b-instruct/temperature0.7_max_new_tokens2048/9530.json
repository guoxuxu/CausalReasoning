  "Problem": "Consider a complex domain function \\\\(z(t) = Re^{i\\\\theta(t)}\\\\) where \\\\(R\\\\) is a constant radial distance and \\\\(\\\\theta(t)\\\\) is a time-dependent angle. We explore the transformation under the matrix \\\\(M(t) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\cos(\\\\omega t) & -\\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\\\\\ \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) & \\\\cos(\\\\omega t) \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\) representing a rotation by \\\\(\\\\omega t\\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the initial angle \\\\(\\\\theta(0)\\\\) after observing only the rotated position at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( M(t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of whether the rotational matrix \\\\( M(t) \\\\) was applied, it is unclear by how much the original angle has changed due to rotation. Observing the end effect alone does not provide sufficient information unless \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is known.",
