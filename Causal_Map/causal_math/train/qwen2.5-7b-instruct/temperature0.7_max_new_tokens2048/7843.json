  "Problem": "Examine a control system defined by the differential equation \\(\\dot{x} = Cx + Du\\), where \\(C\\) is a constant matrix and \\(D\\) is the control input matrix. The analysis covers the impact of a non-linear transformation \\( h(x) = \\sin(Kt) x \\) on the system's state \\(x\\), over time \\(t\\), where \\(K\\) is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf at some time \\( t_1 \\), a linear intervention \\( i(x) = Ptx \\) (where \\( Pt \\) is a time-dependent matrix) is applied, does the outcome \\( x(T) \\) for T > \\( t_1 \\) exclusively depend on \\( C \\) and \\( D \\) and not on \\( K \\) or \\( Pt \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional linear intervention \\( i(x) \\) creates a new dynamic whereby \\( x(T) \\) is influenced contextually by \\(C\\), \\(D\\), on top of \\(K\\) from the non-linear scaling, and \\(Pt\\) from the intervention, thus affecting the trajectory and final state of the system in a way that relies on all involved matrices.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The state x at time T (> t1) is influenced by C and D through the differential equation, and indirectly by Pt through the intervention i(x) at time t1, but not directly by K."
