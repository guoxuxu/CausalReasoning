  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined in the complex plane as \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The equation determines the trajectory of \\\\( z \\\\) as a function of time \\\\( t \\\\) on a unit circle in the complex plane. Analyze the effects of applying the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^k \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a positive integer.\n\nCan we deduce the original function at \\\\( t_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^k \\\\) was initiated, the complex exponential can reach the same state at different times due to its periodic nature. The presence of the power \\\\( k \\\\) in possible scenarios creates multiple, non-unique original states \\\\( z(t_0) \\\\) from which \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could have evolved.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The angular frequency w determines the trajectory z(t) of the complex function over time t; the exponent k defines the transformation g(z) applied to z(t); the value of z(t) influences the transformed function g(z); the observation z(T) at time T provides information about the state of z(t) but does not directly reveal whether the transformation g(z) was applied."
