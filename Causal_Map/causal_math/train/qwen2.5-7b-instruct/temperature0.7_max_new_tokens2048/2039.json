  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that solves the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\Delta u \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) represents the Laplacian operator. We are interested in the effect of applyingt the integral transformation \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int e^{-ikx} u(x,t) dx \\\\), which transforms the function into the Fourier space, on the causal inference in the system.\n\nAssuming at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the inverse Fourier transform is applied as an intervention, will \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) not be affected by the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the inverse Fourier transform at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) effectively brings the function back to its spatial representation, which then continues to evolve according to the spatial PDE. The intervention does not alter the evolution but dictates in which space (Fourier or spatial) the evolution continues.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the inverse Fourier transform as an intervention at time t1 does not directly cause changes in u(x, T) for T > t1, given that the PDE dynamics described by ∂u/∂t = Δu govern the evolution of u(x, t)."
