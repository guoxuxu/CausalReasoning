  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit governed by the function \\\\( V(t) = L \\frac{dI}{dt} + RI \\\\) where \\\\(L\\\\) is inductance, \\\\(R\\\\) is resistance, and \\\\(I\\\\) is current as a function of time. An integral transform (Laplace Transform) is applied to shift the problem into the complex frequency domain as \\\\( V(s) = (Ls + R)I(s) \\\\).\n\nCan the original configuration of \\\\( R \\\\) and \\\\( L \\\\) be identified just from knowing the transformed output signal \\\\( I(s) \\\\) after interventions such as changing \\\\( R \\\\) or \\\\( L \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "No, because the changes in resistance or inductance and their effects on the Laplace Transform output could be compensated or confused by other simultaneous parameter changes (e.g., modifications of inductance or external voltage applications), making it not straightforward to backtrack to the original values without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Resistance and inductance in the original circuit configuration affect the transformed current output in the Laplace domain; current in the time domain influences the transformed current output."
