  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by a Laplace transform \\\\( L(f)(s) = F(s) \\\\) where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is the original time-dependent function and \\\\( F(s) \\\\) its transform in the complex plane. Analyze the impact of applying the inverse transform, denoted as \\\\( L^{-1}(G)(t) \\\\), after manipulating \\\\( G(s) = F(s)R(s) \\\\), where \\\\( R(s) \\\\) is a modification function.\n\nCan we accurately determine which modifications (\\\\( R(s) \\\\) or \\\\( S(s) \\\\), or both) were applied to reach a known function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) based solely on the outcome function?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the potential overlapping effects of different transformations in the frequency domain (such as multiplication by different functions \\\\( R(s) \\\\) and \\\\( S(s) \\\\)), it's generally impossible to uniquely identify which modifications were applied based only on the final time-domain function \\\\( g(t) \\\\). Multiple combinations of \\\\( R(s) \\\\) and \\\\( S(s) \\\\) could produce similar outcomes in time domain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The original transform F(s) is modified by R(s) to produce G(s), which is then inverted to obtain g(t). The inverse transform L^{-1}(G)(t) yields g(t) based on G(s), and knowing g(t) allows us to infer the effects of R(s) on F(s)."
