  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. The transformation applied is \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) where C is another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the system \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\), \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\), influencing the trajectory in the complex plane. The multiplication by \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) could alter both real and imaginary parts differently, leading to a distinct final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) compared to direct evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial complex number z(0) evolves to z(t) through the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\). Applying the transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{Ct}z\\\\) at t=0 results in \\\\(e^{Ct}z(0)\\\\), which then evolves according to the same differential equations. Therefore, without further intervention, z(T) at t=T due to the transformation followed by evolution matches the direct evolution of z_0 to t=T under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\). A directly causes x(t), and B directly causes y(t)."
