  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit modeled by a set of linear differential equations with characteristics matrix \\\\(M\\\\). An input voltage \\\\(V(t)\\\\) is applied, modeled by the function \\\\(V(t) = e^{St}V_0\\\\), where \\\\(S\\\\) is a constant matrix. The response of the circuit, represented by the output current \\\\(I(t)\\\\), is initially determined by the impulse response matrix \\\\(H\\\\).\n\nCan the exact character of interventions used (specific transformations like \\\\(e^{St}V_0\\\\) or \\\\(e^{Ut}V_1\\\\)) be identified strictly based on the endpoint outcome \\\\(I(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output current \\\\(I(T)\\\\) could result from various configurations of voltage transformations due to overlapping effects and non-uniqueness in matrix exponential influences on the circuit. Distinguishing between transformations like \\\\(e^{St}\\\\) and \\\\(e^{Ut}\\\\) based solely on endpoint data is inherently unclear.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
