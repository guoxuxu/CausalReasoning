  "Problem": "Consider a complex integral transformation defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{C} e^{zt} f(t) dt \\\\) where C is a contour in the complex plane and \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a given function. Analyze the impact of changing the contour C to another contour C' in the complex plane.\n\nIf an intervention modifies the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to \\\\( g(t) = f(t)e^{t^2} \\\\) at some time t_1 < T, will the outcome of \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at T rely exclusively on the original contour C, regardless of whether it was changed to C'?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the function integrated along the contour, and different contours could yield different results due to differences in the exponential growth introduced by \\\\( e^{t^2} \\\\) and the way it interacts with the path-dependent integration over C or C'.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
