  "Problem": "Imagine a system where the temperature distribution on a plate is modeled by the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\Delta u = 0 \\\\), and as an experiment, a function \\\\( h(u) = e^{-kt}u \\\\) (where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant) is applied at different times to alter the temperature pattern.\n\nGiven the temperature distribution \\\\( u(T) \\\\), can we determine exactly what interventions were used (whether \\\\( h(u) \\\\), \\\\( j(u) \\\\), or both) solely by analyzing the final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping effects of \\\\( h(u) \\\\) and \\\\( j(u) \\\\) on the temperature patterns can converge to the same distribution at \\\\( u(T) \\\\) through different intervention paths. This overlap makes it challenging to isolate and identify the specific interventions applied merely from the final steady-state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
