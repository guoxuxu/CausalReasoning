  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\) where M is a constant matrix. We investigate the effect of the transformation specified by the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) where D is another constant matrix.\n\nCan we accurately determine the initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, not knowing if the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The potential application of the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) adds uncertainty about the initial state. Without knowing whether the transformation was applied, or details about matrix D, it is challenging to accurately trace back to the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) exclusively based on the observation at T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Observing z(t) at time t=T allows us to infer z_0 at t=0, considering the transformation g(z) = e^(Dt)z. The application of g(z) transforms z_0 into z(t), and reversing this transformation can help determine z_0 from z(t)."
