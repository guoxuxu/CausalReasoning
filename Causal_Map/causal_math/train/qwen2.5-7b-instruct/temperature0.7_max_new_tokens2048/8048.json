  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant control system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu\\\\), where A and B are constant matrices and u is a control input. We analyze the effect of an integral transformation on the state vector described by \\\\( h(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At} x(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\).\n\nGiven the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) after interventions, can the specific control inputs or transformations (like \\\\( h(x) \\\\)) applied at earlier times be determined only from \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple control strategies and transformations could lead to the same final state due to the superposition principle and dependencies of state trajectories on initial conditions and input functions. Without additional data about the system's inputs or state changes at specific times, the actions leading to \\\\( x(T) \\\\) remain ambiguous.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
