  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = F(x, y) \\\\) that maps complex numbers \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) to \\\\( z \\\\), defined by \\\\( F(x, y) = x^2 + iy \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the behavior of \\\\( F \\\\) and its derivatives across transformations defined by the function \\\\( f(x, y) = (e^{Ax}x, e^{By}y) \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constants.\n\nIf, after applying \\\\( F \\\\) to \\\\( x_0, y_0 \\\\), an intervention in the form of \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\) using different constants \\\\( A' \\\\) and \\\\( B' \\\\) is applied at a specific point, will the final result depend only on the original function \\\\( F \\\\) without the effects of \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention using a new set of constants introduces additional transformations to each variable. These transformations affect the final output exponentially, thus making the end result dependent on both the original and the intervened transformations, reflecting the characteristics of \\\\( A', B' \\\\) as well as \\\\( A, B \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "F(x, y) → z; f(x, y) → (e^(Ax)x, e^(By)y); A → e^(Ax); B → e^(By); (e^(Ax)x, e^(By)y) → F(x, y); A' → e^(A'x'); B' → e^(B'y')",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation f(x, y) modifies x and y through exponential functions dependent on constants A and B, which are then input into F(x, y). Different constants A' and B' applied via f(x, y) result in modified inputs for F, thus affecting the final output z."
