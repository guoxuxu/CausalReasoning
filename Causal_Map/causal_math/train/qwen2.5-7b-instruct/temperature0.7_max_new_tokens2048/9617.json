  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(w) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, where \\\\( z(w) = w^2 \\\\). We examine the changes caused by performing a Laplace transformation on \\\\( z(w) \\\\) over time variable t, such that \\\\( L\\{z(w)\\}(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}w^2(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), assuming \\\\( w(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent function.\n\nIf \\\\( w(t) = e^{At} \\\\) for a constant matrix A, and we perform the Laplace transform on \\\\( z(w) \\\\) without further manipulation, will the result \\\\( L\\{z(e^{At})\\}(s) \\\\) uniquely depend on the matrix A and the transformation function \\\\( z(w) = w^2 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( w(t) = e^{At} \\\\) transforms directly via \\\\( z(w) = w^2 \\\\) before applying the Laplace transform, the result will be directly influenced by A and the form of \\\\( w^2 \\\\), given that the square of a matrix exponential depends uniquely on its base matrix.",
