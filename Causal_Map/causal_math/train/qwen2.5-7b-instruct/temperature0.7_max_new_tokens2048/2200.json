  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where a linear time-invariant (LTI) system characterized by its impulse response h(t) is being studied. The signal s(t) is processed, and we analyze the influence of convolution with the impulse response and a Fourier transform applied to the signal.\n\nGiven the Fourier transform of the final output after the interventions, can we identify with certainty the sequential use of both impulse responses h(t) and g(t)?",
  "Explanation": "While the Fourier transform of the output will indicate alterations due to impulse responses, the superposition and convolution properties prevent the definite identification of individual contributions of h(t) and g(t) without additional data. Multiple combinations could result in similar transformed outputs.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The input signal s(t) convolved with the impulse response h(t) produces the output y(t), which is then transformed into the frequency domain Y(freq). Another impulse response g(t) directly affects the frequency domain representation Y(freq)."
