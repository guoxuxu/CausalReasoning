  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in the complex plane evolves according to the equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), with A being a real constant. An external input transformation function \\\\( h(z) = ze^{iBt} \\\\), with B being another real constant, is applied at specific instances.\n\nGiven the observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we definitively verify whether the initial state was \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or \\\\( h(z_0) \\\\) if no other information about intervening transformations is known?",
  "Explanation": "The observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could potentially be reached from either an untransformed initial state undergoing natural evolution or an initial state pre-transformed by \\\\( h(z) \\\\). Without additional information, these scenarios produce indistinguishably different potential trajectories due to their different initial phase adjustments.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
