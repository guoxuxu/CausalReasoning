  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Mx\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. The effect of an external input characterized by the matrix function \\\\( u(t) = e^{Nt}x \\\\) is analyzed, where N is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can it be determined exactly which interventions occurred (whether \\\\( u(t) \\\\), \\\\( v(x) \\\\), or neither), just based on \\\\( x(T) \\\\) and knowing M?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) could be reached by various combinations of interventions with \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(x) \\\\), or direct evolution under M. The overlapping influences and the potential equivalences in trajectories due to the non-uniqueness of exponential matrix effects make it difficult to precisely identify the interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The external input u(t) and the matrix M both influence the state x(T) through their effects on the rate of change of x over time."
