  "Problem": "Consider a spatial domain in which the temperature distribution is represented by the complex function \\\\(T(z,t)\\\\), where \\\\(z\\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\(t\\\\) is time. The initial temperature distribution is given by \\\\(T(z,0) = z^2\\\\). The transformation under consideration is a Laplace transformation applied over time and its inverse applied at a later time \\\\(T\\\\).\n\nIf an additional transformation, say \\\\(T(z,t) = u(z,t) + i*v(z,t)\\\\) where \\\\(u\\\\) and \\\\(v\\\\) represent other changes, is applied at a time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the resultant state at \\\\(T\\\\) only depend on the initial function \\\\(z^2\\\\) and not on the Laplace transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by another transformation at \\\\(t_1\\\\) adds variables and complexities to the system that would make the resultant state depend not only on the original \\\\(z^2\\\\) but also on the effects and interactions of the Laplace transform and the additional transformation applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_map": "T(z,0) = z^2 → T(z,t); T(z,t) = u(z,t) + i*v(z,t) → T(z,t); Laplace transformation over time → T(z,t); Inverse Laplace transformation → T(z,t)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial temperature distribution T(z,0) = z^2 directly influences T(z,t). Applying the transformation T(z,t) = u(z,t) + i*v(z,t) at time t_1 introduces new components u and v, which are independent of the initial function. The Laplace transformation over time and its inverse do not solely depend on the initial function z^2 but also on the introduced components u and v."
