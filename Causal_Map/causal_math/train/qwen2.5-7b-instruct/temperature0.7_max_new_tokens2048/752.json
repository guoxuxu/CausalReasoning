  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( z(t) = t^2 + it \\\\) mapping the real variable t into the complex plane. We analyze this function under the complex Fourier transform, defined by \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i \\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven a modified Fourier transform result, can we determine if a multiplication with a complex exponential term \\\\( e^{i kt} \\\\) took place, and differentiate the specific term applied (k value) by knowing only \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The modification induced by multiplying with \\\\( e^{i kt} \\\\) might be subtle and overlaps with artifacts caused by the quadratic and linear terms of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) themselves. The modified transform does not provide sufficient unique features to decipher the specific value of k or even ascertain the application of such a multiplicand without additional information.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function z(t) is transformed into F(ω) via the complex Fourier transform. Multiplying z(t) by e^(i kt) before transforming results in a modified Fourier transform Modified_F(ω), allowing us to infer the specific k value based on the form of Modified_F(ω)."
