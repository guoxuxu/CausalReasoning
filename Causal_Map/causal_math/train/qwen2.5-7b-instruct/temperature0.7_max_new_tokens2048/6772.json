  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined as \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts respectively. This function is subjected to a Fourier transform, resulting in \\\\( F(z)(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty z(t)e^{-i\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z)(\\omega) \\\\) showing a distinct peak at \\\\( \\omega_0 \\\\), can we specifically determine whether the intervention involved adding a harmonic component, scalar multiplication, or both, based solely on \\\\( F(z)(\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of a peak at \\\\( \\omega_0 \\\\) in the Fourier transform could imply an added harmonic component. However, without knowing the original and transitional states of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), it's impossible to definitively establish whether a scalar modification, addition of a harmonic, or both occurred, as the scalar factor could also affect the amplitude of all frequency components.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "z(t) is influenced by u(t) and v(t), which are real and imaginary parts respectively. Adding a harmonic component or scalar multiplication affects u(t) and v(t), thereby influencing z(t). The presence of a distinct peak at ω_0 in F(z)(ω) suggests a specific frequency component in z(t), indicating potential involvement of a harmonic component, but does not definitively show scalar multiplication."
