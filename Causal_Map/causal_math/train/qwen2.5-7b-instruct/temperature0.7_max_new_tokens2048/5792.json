  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where a function z(t) measures the temperature at a point in space, evolving according to the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\alpha \\\\nabla^2 z\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. We consider the impact of a time-varying boundary condition applied as \\\\(f(z) = e^{Bt}z\\\\) where B is a constant scalar.\n\nGiven the final state z(T), can we precisely determine what interventions (\\\\(f(z)\\\\), \\\\(g(z)\\\\), or both) were used if we only know the value of z(T)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple scenarios involving different parameters B and C, as well as varying times and magnitudes of application, could result in the same final state z(T). This ambiguity, compounded with the continuous nature and diffusivity of the heat equation, makes it impossible to uniquely back-calculate the precise sequence or type of interventions applied.",
