  "Problem": "Analyze the effect of an integral transformation on a function's Fourier transform. Suppose we have a function \\\\( g(x) = \\\\sin(x) \\\\) and we apply the transformation \\\\( T(g)(x) = \\\\int_0^x g(t) dt \\\\). Consider the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) as applied on both \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and \\\\( T(g)(x) \\\\).\n\nIf another transformation \\\\( S(g)(x) = g(x) + x^2 \\\\) is applied at a point during the computation of \\\\( T(g)(x) = \\\\int_0^x g(t) dt \\\\), will the Fourier transform of the final state depend only on the transformation \\\\( S \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final Fourier transform reflects both the initial effect of \\\\( T \\\\) and the subsequent effect of \\\\( S \\\\). The transformation \\\\( T \\\\) changes the integrand structure significantly which, when further modified by \\\\( S \\\\), results in a final state whose spectral properties are influenced by both transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation S(g)(x) = g(x) + x^2 before computing T(g)(x) = ∫_0^x g(t) dt changes the resulting function, which in turn affects its Fourier transform F(T(g))(ω). Therefore, the Fourier transform F(S(g))(ω) of the function after applying S is different from F(T(g))(ω)."
