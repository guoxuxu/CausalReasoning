  "Problem": "Examine the effect of a Fourier transformation denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) defined on the real line. Further, let's consider that \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is initially described by a differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}g(t) = -\\lambda g(t) \\\\) where \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) is a positive real number. The Fourier transform is then impacted by an additional transformation \\\\( h(f) = e^{-\\alpha |f|^2} \\\\), where \\\\( f \\\\) represents frequency and \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nIf an additional intervention transformation \\\\( h(f) \\\\) is applied at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resulting profile \\\\( |\\\\mathcal{F}[g](f, T)| \\\\) for T > t_1 remain dependent only on the characteristics of \\\\( h(f) \\\\) and not on the intrinsic properties defined by \\\\( \\lambda \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final profile of \\\\( |\\\\mathcal{F}[g](f, T)| \\\\) will depend both on the intrinsic decay parameter \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) as it influences the overall decay aspect across the time domain, and on \\\\( h(f) \\\\), which modifies the frequency response. Thus, the outcome reflects a combination of both effects.",
