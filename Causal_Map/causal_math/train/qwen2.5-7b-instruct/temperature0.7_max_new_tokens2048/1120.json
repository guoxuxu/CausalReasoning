  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where we have a Holomorphic function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined on the complex plane. The integral transformation is given by \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex variable.\n\nGiven the end-result \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), can we precisely identify if there was an intervention \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), and what its value was, based only on the knowledge of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the output \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) encapsulates the effects of any transformations applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), determining exactly whether and which transformation (like \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)) was applied requires more than just the final \\\\( Z(s) \\\\). The transformation results could be similar due to other contributing factors or effects not isolated by observing \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
