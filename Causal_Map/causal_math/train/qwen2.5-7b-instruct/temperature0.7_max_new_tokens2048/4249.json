  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions evolving over time according to the system \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = Pz(t)\\\\), with P being a constant matrix. We investigate the effect of a linear transformation \\\\( g(z) = Qz \\\\), where Q is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt}z = Pz\\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T be identical to evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt}z = Pz\\\\) to T without applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( g(z) = Qz \\\\) at the outset modifies the initial conditions. Depending on the nature of Q relative to P, this can change the trajectory in the complex plane, resulting in a different state at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation Q to z_0 and then evolving it under dz/dt = Pz from t=0 to T results in the same state z(T) as evolving z_0 under dz/dt = Pz from t=0 to T without the transformation."
