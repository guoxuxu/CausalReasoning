  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\(\\{ z(t) \\}\\) that maps complex numbers onto a complex plane. The function is defined by \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant and \\( z_0 \\) is the initial complex number. We explore the effects of the transformation \\( f(z) = e^{\\alpha t}z \\) where \\( \\alpha \\) is another real constant, on the evolution of this system.\n\nIf \\( f(z) \\) is applied to a complex number \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}z_0 \\) without further intervention, will \\( z(T) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( z_0 \\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}z_0 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( f(z) \\) initially changes the magnitude of \\( z_0 \\) by a factor of \\( e^{\\alpha T} \\), thus altering its trajectory in the complex plane. This change in magnitude causes \\( z(T) \\) to differ from what would be obtained by simply evolving \\( z_0 \\) under \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}z_0 \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The application of transformation f(z) followed by evolution under z(t) = e^(iωt)z0 results in the same z(T) as evolving z0 directly under z(t) = e^(iωt)z0 from t = 0 to t = T."
