  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) in a domain \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\). If \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) is a solution, then we apply a transformation by adding a complex function \\\\(g(z)\\\\) where \\\\(z = x + iy\\\\) and examine changes in the boundary behavior.\n\nDoes the addition of a complex function \\\\(g(z)\\\\) to the solution \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) of the Laplace equation change the boundary values of \\\\(u\\\\) on \\\\(\\\\partial \\\\Omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Adding a function \\\\(g(z)\\\\) potentially changes the harmonic nature within \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\) and thus alters how \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) behaves on \\\\(\\\\partial \\\\Omega\\\\). Since \\\\(g(z)\\\\) might not be harmonic, the combined function could fail the Laplace equation, modifying boundary conditions.",
