  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model in which the flow (\\\\( f(x) \\\\)) through a nonlinear system is described by a complex function \\\\( f(x) = e^{iz} \\\\), where \\\\( z = Ax + B \\\\), and A, B are matrices. We examine the impact of an integral transformation applied to \\\\( f(x) \\\\): (\\\\( T[g(x)] = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-ixt} g(x) dx \\\\)), for a function \\\\( g(x) \\\\).\n\nCan we accurately trace back and determine all the transformations applied (both \\\\( F(x) \\\\), \\\\( H(x) \\\\), and their order) based solely on the given \\\\( T[f(x)] \\\\) output?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping effects of nonlinear transformations and their non-commutative nature make it highly challenging, if not impossible, to precisely determine each transformation and their sequential order from the output alone. The different potential combinations and operations blur the distinctions in output, preventing accurate backtracking.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
