  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow modeled by the Navier-Stokes equations in a two-dimensional domain. Let \\\\( \\\\mathbf{u}(x, y, t) \\\\) be the velocity field, and suppose a transformation by a vector field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v}=\\\\nabla \\\\times \\\\psi \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( \\\\psi \\\\) is a stream function representing a perturbation.\n\nCan we deduce the original velocity field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{u}_0 \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( \\\\mathbf{u}(x, y, t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) without knowing whether the field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\) was introduced?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the perturbation introduction, reversing the Navier-Stokes equations to determine the initial condition \\\\( \\\\mathbf{u}_0 \\\\) would yield multiple potential solutions, especially considering the sensitivity to initial conditions and the possible chaotic nature of the flow.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The stream function ψ influences the velocity field u, and the original velocity field u_0 at t=0 leads to the observed velocity field u at t=T."
