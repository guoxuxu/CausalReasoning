  "Problem": "Consider a linear space of complex functions, where each function obeys the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2 u}{dx^2} = -\\\\lambda u\\\\), and \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) is a constant. We explore how the Laplace transform, defined by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(u)(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-sx}u(x)dx\\\\), influences the solutions.\n\nDoes applying the Laplace transform to the function \\\\(u(x) = \\\\cos(\\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda} x)\\\\) alter the characterization of the function that satisfies the differential equation when transformed back without further transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\(u(x) = \\\\cos(\\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda} x)\\\\) is \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(u)(s) = \\\\frac{s}{s^2 + \\\\lambda}\\\\), which still corresponds to a solution of the transformed differential equation. Thus, transforming back will result in the same type of function, satisfying the same differential equation, indicating no change in characterization under this equation.",
