  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( f(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\) where A is a real constant matrix and z a complex number. We study the behavior of this function when subject to transformations and analyze the inverse Laplace transformation which is given by \\\\( F(p) = L^{-1} \\\\{ f(z) \\\\} \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is initially applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then the system evolves naturally with the inverse Laplace transform applied, is the resulting function \\\\( F(p) \\\\) at p solely dependent on \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Laplace transform \\\\( F(p) \\\\) directly depends on the form of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) which is defined explicitly by \\\\( A \\\\) and the initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\). There are no other variables introduced, thus the resulting function is solely dependent on \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The resulting function F(p) is dependent on A and z_0 through the transformations defined by the exponential and inverse Laplace transform."
