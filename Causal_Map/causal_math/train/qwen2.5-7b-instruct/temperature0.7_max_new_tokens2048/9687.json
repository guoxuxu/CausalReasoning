  "Problem": "Consider a series of random variables \\\\( X_1, X_2, ..., X_n \\\\), each formed by the linear transformation \\\\( Y_i = AX_i \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix. We examine the impact of the Fourier transform on these variables and explore the causal inference across these transformations.\n\nIf an additional transformation, say \\\\( Z_i = B(X_i + Y_i) \\\\) (where \\\\( B \\\\) is another constant matrix), is introduced after applying the Fourier transform to \\\\( X_i \\\\), will the resulting \\\\( Z_i \\\\)'s characteristics be dependent solely on the operations described without considering the original properties of \\\\( X_i \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resultant variable \\\\( Z_i \\\\) incorporates components both from the original \\\\( X_i \\\\) and transformed \\\\( Y_i \\\\), thus retaining dependencies not only on the transformations applied (A and Fourier transform) but also intrinsically on the properties of \\\\( X_i \\\\). The interaction between these transformations and the original characteristics of \\\\( X_i \\\\) influences the final output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of X_i directly influences both Y_i and Z_i, and Y_i also directly influences Z_i."
