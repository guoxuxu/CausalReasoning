  "Problem": "Consider the impact of different transform kernels in an integral transformation on a function \\\\( f(x) \\\\). Define transform kernels \\\\( K(t, x) = e^{At} \\\\) and intervention kernels \\\\( L(t, x) = e^{Bt} \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices, on the analysis of the function over time.\n\nKnowing the transformed function at t = T, can we uniquely determine \\\\( f(x) \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether kernel \\\\( K \\\\) or any other kernel was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the kernel used (if any), it is impossible to reverse the transformation uniquely, especially if the kernels do not commute or if their effects are not easily separable.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
