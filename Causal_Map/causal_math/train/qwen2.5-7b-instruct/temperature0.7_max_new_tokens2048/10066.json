  "Problem": "Consider a dynamic model where the temperature of a system \\\\( T \\\\) is governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\alpha \\\\nabla^2 T \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. We investigate the effect of an initial condition modification characterized by \\\\( T(x,0) = T_0 + h(x) \\\\), where \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is a heat source distribution function.\n\nGiven the temperature distribution \\\\( T(x,t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t \\\\), can we infer the original heat source distribution \\\\( h(x) \\\\) without knowing whether the initial condition was modified?",
  "Explanation": "The evolved temperature distribution \\\\( T(x,t) \\\\) does not uniquely specify the initial heat source distribution \\\\( h(x) \\\\) since many different distributions \\\\( h(x) \\\\) could lead to the same temperature profile at time \\\\( t \\\\) due to the complexity of diffusion processes.",
