  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by a Laplace transform \\\\( L(f)(s) = F(s) \\\\) where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is the original time-dependent function and \\\\( F(s) \\\\) its transform in the complex plane. Analyze the impact of applying the inverse transform, denoted as \\\\( L^{-1}(G)(t) \\\\), after manipulating \\\\( G(s) = F(s)R(s) \\\\), where \\\\( R(s) \\\\) is a modification function.\n\nIf \\\\( R(s) = 1 \\\\) is applied to \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and transformed back to the time domain using \\\\( L^{-1} \\\\), will \\\\( g(t) \\\\) at any time t be the same as the unmodified \\\\( f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "When \\\\( R(s) = 1 \\\\), there is no modification made to \\\\( F(s) \\\\). Therefore, \\\\( G(s) = F(s) \\\\). Applying the inverse Laplace transform to \\\\( G(s) \\\\) yields the original function, \\\\( g(t) = f(t) \\\\), indicating that the output matches the original function perfectly without any effect from the non-intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "When R(s) = 1, G(s) remains equal to F(s), and thus, after applying the inverse transform, g(t) equals f(t)."
