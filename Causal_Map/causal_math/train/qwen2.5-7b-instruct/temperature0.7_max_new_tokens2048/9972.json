  "Problem": "Evaluate the stability and causal inference of the system governed by the linear partial differential equation given by \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) where L is a linear differential operator. We consider the influence of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,t) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{u(x,t)\\\\}\\\\)\n\nGiven the state \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,T)\\\\) at t = T, can we determine definitively if a transformation (Fourier or Laplace) was applied at any point solely from \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,T)\\\\) without knowing the intervention explicitly?",
  "Explanation": "The analysis of \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,T)\\\\) alone, without additional context or intervention timelines, does not allow for definitive backtracking of whether and which transformations were applied. Both transformations could yield similar states at \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,T)\\\\), especially if they commutate with L, leading to ambiguities.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function u(x,t) transforms through the Fourier transform to produce its frequency domain representation \\u0302u(k,t), which then evolves over time to become \\u0302u(k,T). The operator L influences the rate of change of u(x,t) with respect to time."
