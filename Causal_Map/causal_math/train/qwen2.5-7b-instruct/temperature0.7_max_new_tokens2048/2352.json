  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where a signal \\( x(t) \\) undergoes a Fourier transform to produce \\( X(f) \\), which is then altered by a transfer function \\( H(f) \\) and subsequently inverse Fourier transformed to generate \\( y(t) \\).\n\nKnowing \\( y(t) \\) and the specific type of \\( H(f) \\) applied, can we explicitly determine if an additional filter \\( G(f) \\) was used during the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Even with knowledge of \\( H(f) \\) and observing \\( y(t) \\), identifying the application of \\( G(f) \\) requires further information or assumptions. Multiple combinations of \\( H(f) \\) and \\( G(f) \\) can yield the same \\( y(t) \\), thus not guaranteeing a unique solution.",
