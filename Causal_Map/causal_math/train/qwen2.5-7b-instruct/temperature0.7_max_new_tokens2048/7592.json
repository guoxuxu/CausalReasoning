  "Problem": "Evaluate the system of differential equations characterized by the Laplace transform of functions and their inverse. Let \\\\( X(s) \\\\) be the Laplace transform of a function x(t), and \\\\( H(s) \\\\) the transfer function of a linear system. The response of the system is given by \\\\( Y(s) = H(s)X(s) \\\\), where \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is the inverse Laplace transform of \\\\( Y(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the final output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) and knowledge that an intervention was made with a filter \\\\( G(s) \\\\), can we determine what the specific transformation caused by \\\\( H(s) \\\\) was?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing only the final output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) and the application of \\\\( G(s) \\\\) does not uniquely determine the characteristics or specific transformation imposed by \\\\( H(s) \\\\). Multiple configurations of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) can yield the same output when combined with \\\\( G(s) \\\\), especially if they similarly alter the input's frequency components.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace transform of the input function X(s) is transformed by the transfer function H(s) to produce the Laplace transform of the output Y(s). An intervention with the filter G(s) modifies X(s) before it is transformed by H(s)."
