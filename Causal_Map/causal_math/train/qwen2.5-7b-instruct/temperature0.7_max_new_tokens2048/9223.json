  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t = Lu\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator. The solution at any time can be transformed using a Fourier transformation \\\\( F(u) = \\\\hat{u}(k) \\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is the wave number.\n\nIf an intervention in the form of a filtering operation \\\\( G(u) = u(k_m) \\\\), which filters out all modes except \\\\( k = k_m \\\\), is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) at T > t_1 depend only on the operator \\\\(L\\\\) and not on the Fourier transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( G(u) \\\\), by filtering specific wave numbers, modifies how the state evolves under \\\\(L\\\\), emphasizing the influence of specific modes. Thus, both the Fourier transformation and the filtering affect the final state at T, showcasing dependency beyond just \\\\(L\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
