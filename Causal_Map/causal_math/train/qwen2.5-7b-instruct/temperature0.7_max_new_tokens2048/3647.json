  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z + \\\\alpha \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency, and \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant complex number. Study the effect of the integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-i \\\\omega s} z(s) \\\\, ds \\\\) over a time interval [0, T].\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( H(z) = e^{-i \\\\omega t_1}z \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the original differential equation parameters \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on the impact of \\\\( H(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( H(z) \\\\) modifies the trajectory by introducing a phase shift specific to the time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) at which it was applied. This shift affects the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), making the trajectory dependent not only on the original parameters but also significantly on the timing and nature of the intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of z with respect to time (dz/dt) is directly caused by iωz and α. The function z(t) influences the integral transformation T(z) through integration. At time t1, applying H(z) does not directly affect the endpoint z(T) for T > t1, as z(T) depends on the original differential equation parameters ω and initial conditions, rather than the intervention H(z)."
