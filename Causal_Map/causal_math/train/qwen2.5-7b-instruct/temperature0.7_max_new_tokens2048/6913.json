  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + A\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} = 0\\\\), where A is a constant and u is a function of both x and t. An integral transformation, specifically the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), is applied to u resulting in \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t)\\\\), where k represents the wave number in the transformed domain.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) is applied to a function \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) at t = 0, and then the equation is allowed to evolve under the given PDE without further intervention, will \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t)\\\\) at t = T reflect the evolution had \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) been allowed to evolve directly under the PDE?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the PDE also results in a linear evolution in the transformed space, following \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t) = e^{-Ak^2t}\\\\hat{u}(k, 0)\\\\). This represents the same evolution as the direct application of the PDE to \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\), showing that the transformed state follows the dictated evolution of the original equation.",

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Fourier transform to u(x,0) results in hat{u}(k,0), which evolves over time t according to the PDE to become hat{u}(k,t). Directly evolving u(x,0) under the PDE results in u(x,t), whose Fourier transform becomes hat{u}(k,t). Thus, hat{u}(k,t) reflects the evolution of u(x,0) under the PDE."
