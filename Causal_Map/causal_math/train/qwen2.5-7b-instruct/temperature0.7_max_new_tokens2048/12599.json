  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a matrix differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a constant matrix. We explore the effects of a transformation defined by the matrix function \\\\( g(x) = e^{Mt}x \\\\) over time t, where M is a different constant matrix.\n\nKnowing the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we determine what transformations were applied (whether \\\\( g(x) \\\\), \\\\( h(x) \\\\), or both) solely based on the endpoint value?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) could potentially result from various sequences of the transformations involving M and Q due to their matrix exponential nature and the potential overlap and interaction of their effects, which blurs the ability to determine specific interventions from the endpoint alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation g(x) depends on M, and the state x at time T is influenced by the differential equation's matrix D. Knowing x(T) allows us to infer the effect of M through g(x), but determining the specific sequence of transformations (g(x) or h(x) or both) requires additional information."
