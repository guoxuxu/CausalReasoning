  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolves over time according to the system \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where P is a 2x2 matrix. Evaluate the effects of a Laplace transformation defined by \\\\( L\\{f(t)\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)dt \\\\) on this system at different stages.\n\nIf, at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a transformation defined by adding a vector \\\\( v = (v_x, v_iy) \\\\) is applied as an intervention, and the system is further evolved under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), will the final form of the function depend only on P and not on the Laplace transformation or the vector v?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by adding the vector \\\\( v \\\\) and the initial application of the Laplace transform both play crucial roles in determining the final state of the function. The vector v changes the state vector at the moment of intervention, thereby altering how the function evolves under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\) from that point onward.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The matrix P directly influences the evolution of z over time, and the vector v directly influences the state of z at a specific time t. The Laplace transformation does not directly cause changes in z within the given system dynamics."
