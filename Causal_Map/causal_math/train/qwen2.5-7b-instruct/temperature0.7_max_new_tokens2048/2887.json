  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}f(t)dt \\\\). We explore the effect of a convolution operation where \\\\( g(t) = f(t) * h(t) \\\\), with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) being another time-domain function and the corresponding Laplace transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\).\n\nIf an additional operation, represented by multiplying each system's output by a damping factor \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\) (where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant), is introduced at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will \\\\( G(s) \\\\) still represent the Laplace transform of the modified system output correctly?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing the damping factor alters the original system behavior, effectively introducing a new system characterized by \\\\( f(t) \\\\cdot e^{-at} \\\\). The resulting Laplace transform would be \\\\( F(s + a) \\\\), not merely \\\\( F(s) \\\\), leading to a different overall Laplace transform when considering both \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "F(s) → G(s); H(s) → G(s); a → damping_factor; t_1 → application_of_damping_factor; G(s) → modified_output",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace transform F(s) and H(s) of the input functions f(t) and h(t) respectively cause the Laplace transform G(s) of the convolution g(t) = f(t) * h(t). Introducing a damping factor e^(-at) at time t_1 modifies the output, which is reflected in the Laplace transform G(s) of the modified system output."
