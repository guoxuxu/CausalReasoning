  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) and its impact on the differential equations system \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and z represents a complex variable associated with time t. We analyze the system transformation under the integral transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{i \\\\omega s} ds \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf we apply the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) to the system at t = 0 and let the system evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) without intervention, will the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T represent the same final state as if we had let the system evolve from t = 0 to T under just \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the system initially by adding a complex integral term to the state, which interacts with the system matrix A. This initial modification alters the trajectory of the system, and hence, the state at t = T will be fundamentally different.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The exponential function f(z) and the integral transformation g(z) both influence the derivative of x, with A and t also directly causing changes in the derivative of x. The constant ω affects g(z), and T determines the final state x(t)."
