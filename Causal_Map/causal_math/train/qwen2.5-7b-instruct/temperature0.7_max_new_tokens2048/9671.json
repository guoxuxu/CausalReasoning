  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined on the complex plane, which follows the equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\), with \\\\( C \\\\) being a complex number. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Ct}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) is applied over a time period \\\\( T \\\\).\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( S(z) = \\\\int_0^{t_1} e^{Ct}z(t) dt \\\\) is applied to the system, does the result of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) solely rely on the original dynamics granted by \\\\( C \\\\) (i.e., \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( S(z) \\\\) as an intervention changes the cumulative trajectory of the function due to the integration, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent not only on \\\\( C \\\\) but also on the effects of \\\\( S(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of \\( z(T) \\) is determined by the initial dynamics given by \\( C \\) through the differential equation \\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\), and this value influences the result of the integral transformations \\( T(z) \\) and \\( S(z) \\)."
