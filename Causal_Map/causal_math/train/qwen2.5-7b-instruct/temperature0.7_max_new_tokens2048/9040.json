  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are square matrices and \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are vectors. The function describes the evolution of two components combined linearly over time and affected by different transformation matrices.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and type of intervention (the application of \\\\( C \\\\)), can we confidently trace back to initial vectors \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) without ambiguity?",
  "Explanation": "Despite knowing the intervention, the specific influence of matrices \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) combined with the complexity introduced by matrix \\\\( C \\\\) results in a system state that can originate from several possible initial combinations of \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\). Multiple initial scenarios can produce the same end state under such nonlinear transformations, particularly because the influence of \\\\( C \\\\), \\\\( A \\\\), and \\\\( B \\\\) might not be separable in a unique manner.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Given the final state z(T), we can trace back to the initial vectors x and y through the equations z(T) = e^(AT)x + e^(BT)y, but this process may not be unique due to the linear combination and the nature of matrix exponentials."
