  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) and its impact when applied to a function described by \\\\( g(z) = e^{az} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant. The study will examine how transformations and temporal evolutions based on these mathematical relations affect causal inferences.\n\nSuppose an intervention modifies \\\\( a \\\\) to \\\\( b \\\\) at some point \\\\( z_1 \\\\). Will the result of the system at \\\\( z_2 > z_1 \\\\) depend solely on \\\\( b \\\\) and not on the previous parameter \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention shifting \\\\( a \\\\) to \\\\( b \\\\) alters the trajectory of \\\\( f(g(z)) \\\\) from \\\\( e^{-az} \\\\) to \\\\( e^{-bz} \\\\), beginning at \\\\( z_1 \\\\). The result at \\\\( z_2 \\\\) will depend on both the history of the system (dominated by \\\\( a \\\\) up to \\\\( z_1 \\\\)) and the impact of the new parameter \\\\( b \\\\). Hence, the system's state reflects both parameters over time.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "An intervention changing parameter a to b at point z_1 influences g(z) at that point, which then affects f(g(z)). Subsequently, z_1's effect on b propagates through g(z) to f(g(z)) at z_2, but the change from a to b is the primary driver."
