  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where C is a complex constant and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. This system undergoes a transformation defined by the operator \\\\( T(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) where A is a constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new operator \\\\( S(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend exclusively on the original system's parameters \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not on A or D?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( S(z) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces additional modifications to the system's state. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on both the original parameters and the transformations introduced by A and D. The specific influences of these matrices on the trajectory can change the outcome at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
