  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear operator. We explore the impact of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) which converts function u(x, t) into its frequency components U(k, t).\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\(U(k, T)\\\\) at time T, can we deduce the original function \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) without knowing whether a Fourier transform was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Regardless of whether the Fourier transform was explicitly mentioned as being applied, knowing \\\\(U(k, T)\\\\) allows us to use the inverse Fourier transform to retrieve \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) and to deduce the initial condition \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) by solving the PDE backwards, assuming L is conducive to such operations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The Fourier transform of the state U(k, T) at time T can be inverse-transformed to recover the function u(x, T). The initial condition u(x, 0) determines the initial function u_0(x), which, when evolved according to the PDE, leads to the state u(x, T)."
