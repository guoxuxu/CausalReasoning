  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing application where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed using a Fourier transform, represented as \\\\( X(f) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{x(t)\\\\} \\\\). The transformed signal is then processed through a linear time-invariant system characterized by a frequency response \\\\( H(f) \\\\). We are particularly interested in the impact of modifying the signal processing steps with the inclusion of an inverse Fourier transform defined by \\\\( x'(t) = \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\\\{X'(f)\\\\} \\\\), where \\\\( X'(f) = H(f) \\\\cdot X(f) \\\\).\n\nBy observing \\\\( x''(t) \\\\), can we determine explicitly which filters \\\\( H(f) \\\\) and \\\\( G(f) \\\\) were applied, given their potential non-commutative properties in sequence?",
  "Explanation": "Both the sequence and the specific characteristics of the filters \\\\( H(f) \\\\) and \\\\( G(f) \\\\) influence the final signal \\\\( x''(t) \\\\). The non-commutative property of their ordering and potential overlap in their effects make it challenging to uniquely deconstruct and identify the sequence or individual impacts of \\\\( H(f) \\\\) and \\\\( G(f) \\\\) just by observing the outcome \\\\( x''(t) \\\\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The original signal x(t) is transformed into X(f) via Fourier transform; X(f) is modified by the frequency response H(f) to produce X'(f); X'(f) is then inverse-Fourier-transformed into x'(t); X(f) is also transformed into x''(t); X'(f) is further modified by G(f) to produce X''(f), which is inverse-Fourier-transformed into x''(t)."
