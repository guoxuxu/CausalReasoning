  "Problem": "Assess the effect of the integral transformation defined by the operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T}[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\), commonly known as the Laplace Transform, on a function \\\\( f(t) = t^2 \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( f(t) = t^2 \\\\) is subjected to the Laplace Transform, is the transformed function invariant under the original function's behavior without the transform applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Laplace Transform to \\\\( f(t) = t^2 \\\\) results in \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T}[f](s) = \\\\frac{2}{s^3} \\\\), which significantly alters the function's representation and behavior, demonstrating a dependency on the variable \\\\( s \\\\), distinct from the original \\\\( t^2 \\\\) dependence.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
