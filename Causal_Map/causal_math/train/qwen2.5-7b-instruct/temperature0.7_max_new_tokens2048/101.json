  "Problem": "Consider a system involving variables \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(z\\\\) with the relationship governed by the integral transform \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At}x(\\\\tau)d\\\\tau \\\\), where A is a constant matrix. The impact of altering variable \\\\(x\\\\) through a function \\\\( f(x) = e^{Bt}x \\\\) is analyzed.\n\nIf \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the given integral transform without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x(t) \\\\) was directly used in the integral transform to t = T under the original definition of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(x) \\\\) modifies \\\\( x(t) \\\\) to \\\\( e^{Bt}x(t) \\\\), changing the integrand of the transformation. Since \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) scales or transforms the function differently over time, \\\\( z(t) \\\\) will also evolve differently due to the altered inputs into the integral, leading to a different final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Variable x directly causes z through the integral transform. Applying the function f(x) to x before transforming it into z introduces an additional exponential factor, potentially altering the relationship between x and z."
