  "Problem": "Consider a physical system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a constant matrix representing mechanical dynamics. Additionally, consider a transformation applied to the state described by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}\\\\)z, where D is another constant matrix and t represents time.\n\nGiven an observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after it has evolved to time T, can we definitively trace back to an initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or determine whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied, without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit information about the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or the initial condition, it's impossible to ascertain if the observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\) resulted from a transformed or untransformed initial state due to the exponential transformation potentially changing initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The matrix M directly causes the rate of change of z. The matrix D and time t directly cause the transformed state g(z). The initial state z_0 directly causes the state z(T) at time T."
