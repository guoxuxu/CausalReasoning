  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency, and let's analyze its behavior under the integral transformation \\\\( I[z](t) = \\int_{0}^{t} e^{-i\\omega s}z(s)ds \\\\).\n\nIf an additional phase shift function \\\\( g(t) = e^{i\\phi} \\\\) where \\\\( \\phi \\\\) is a constant phase, is applied post the initial transformation at any time before ending, will the resulting integral \\\\( I[g \\cdot z](t) \\\\) be non-zero?",
  "Explanation": "The phase shift changes the alignment of the complex exponential's real and imaginary parts, thus altering the outcome of the integral transformation. This results in a non-zero integral since the phase factor \\\\( e^{i\\phi} \\\\) does not cancel out during integration over a non-symmetric interval relative to the phase altered exponential.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the phase shift function g(t) to z(t) before integrating results in a non-zero integral I[g * z](t), as I[g * z](t) depends on both the transformed z(t) and the phase shift g(t)."
