  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real functions governed by the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + B\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Cy + D\\\\), respectively. We investigate the behavior under the integral transform \\\\(T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s}z(s) ds\\\\).\n\nKnowing only \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at the end time T, can we deduce the exact details of the interventions (values of F, G, H, I) or even ascertain if any change was made in the differential equations of \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the non-inversibility of the integral transform which mixes the influences over time, and the lack of unique resolution of differential contribution from T[z](t) alone, it is hard to back-calculate and identify the specifics or even the existence of the interventions without additional information about the trajectories of \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The values of A, B, C, and D in the differential equations determine the behavior of x(t) and y(t), which in turn affect T[z](t) through the integral transform. Knowing z(T) does not allow us to deduce the exact values of A, B, C, and D or confirm if they were changed."
