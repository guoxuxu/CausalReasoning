  "Problem": "Consider the fluid dynamics described by the Navier-Stokes equations. Let \\\\( \\\\vec{u}(x,t) \\\\) represent the velocity field of a fluid, where \\\\( x \\\\) is the position and \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We investigate the behavior of the fluid under a transformation \\\\( f(\\\\vec{u}) = \\\\nabla \\\\times (\\\\vec{u}) \\\\), which represents the curl of the velocity field.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the Stokes' transformation \\\\( g(\\\\vec{u}) = \\\\nabla \\\\cdot (\\\\vec{u}) \\\\) (the divergence) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( \\\\vec{u}(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the original Navier-Stokes equations and not on the applied transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(\\\\vec{u}) \\\\) adds a new dynamic by modifying the divergence of the field, potentially altering fluid density and pressure fields. This intervention influences how the fluid evolves from t_1 to T, making the endpoint not solely dependent on the original fluid properties defined by the Navier-Stokes equations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The divergence of the velocity field (g(\\u)) does not directly cause the velocity field at a future time (\\u(T)), but the curl of the velocity field (\\nabla × (\\u)) and the original Navier-Stokes equations do influence \\u(T). The divergence (\\nabla · (\\u)) may indirectly affect \\u(T) through its influence on the fluid's state at earlier times."
