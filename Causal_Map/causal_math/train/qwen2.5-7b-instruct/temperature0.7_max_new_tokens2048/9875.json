  "Problem": "Consider a control system characterized by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu\\\\), where A is a constant matrix and B is a control matrix. An integral transformation with kernel K(x, s) is applied to the state x, yielding a transformed state \\\\(z(t) = \\\\int_0^t K(x(s), s) ds\\\\).\n\nSuppose an additional controlling effect via a matrix C is added at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), modifying the system to \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu + Cv\\\\). Will the transformed state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on the original system parameters A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the new control matrix C as an intervention at time t_1 modifies the system dynamics, and thus affects the state x(t) and consequently z(T). The contribution of C cannot be ignored as it impacts the state trajectory past t_1.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
