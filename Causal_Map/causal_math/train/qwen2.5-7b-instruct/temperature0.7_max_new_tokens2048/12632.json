  "Problem": "We consider the effects of the Laplace Transform on a differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix, and study how this affects the system's response. We implement the transform \\\\(g(z) = \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s)\\\\) and analyze its impact on the solution over the complex variable s.\n\nIf \\\\(g(z)\\\\) is applied to a function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = 0, and the system is allowed to evolve according to \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\) without further intervention, will the Laplace transform of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at any point s be equivalent to the outcome if the transform was not initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Laplace Transform \\\\(g(z)\\\\) modifies the function into a different domain (from time-domain to frequency-domain), affecting how the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\) governs its dynamics in the complex plane. It fundamentally changes the presentation and solution of the differential equation, resulting in a different type of functional behavior in the s-domain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The diagonalizability of D influences the form of z(t), which in turn determines g(z). The value of t affects z(t), and s is related to g(z) through the Laplace transform."
