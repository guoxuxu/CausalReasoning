  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that evolves according to the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}z = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We investigate the influence of the Fourier transformation \\\\( F(z) \\\\) defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nCan we reconstruct the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any initial time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) from the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) observed at time \\\\( T \\\\) without knowing the initial form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the evolution law \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}z = i\\\\omega z \\\\), the form of the function in the frequency domain remains consistent. Thus, knowledge of \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) uniquely determines the form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) up to a constant phase factor, even at the initial time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of the complex-valued function z(t) changes over time according to the partial differential equation, and its Fourier transform F(z) can be used to represent z(t) in frequency domain; knowing z(t) at initial time t=0 allows reconstruction of z(t) at any time, while observing F(z) at time T provides information about z(t) in frequency domain."
