  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency, and the Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) applied to it. We explore the effect of initial modifications and transformations onto the causal inference of the function's behavior over time.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), changing its frequency to a new constant \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\), will the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 only depend on the new frequency \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) and not on the original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the trajectory from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) forward, introducing a different frequency which in turn affects the transform outcome. However, the transform's value from 0 to \\\\( t_1 \\\\) is affected by the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Therefore, both frequencies impact the final calculation of the Laplace transform at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
