  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving in a potential field described by the equation \\\\( U(x) = \\\\frac{1}{2} k x^2 \\\\) where k is a positive constant. The particle's motion is transformed by a change of coordinates given by \\\\( x(t) = e^{\\\\alpha t} x_0 \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the final position \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether the transformation by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final position \\\\( x(T) \\\\) can result from various combinations of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) values, each providing a different scaling effect that could yield the same final position. The non-invertibility of the exponential scaling in time prevents us from uniquely identifying the parameters of interventions from the final state alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
