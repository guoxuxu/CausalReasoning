  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z = x + iy \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( x \\\\), \\\\( y \\\\) are real variables. We study the function transformation by the integral kernel \\\\( K(s, t) = e^{-st} \\\\) under operation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty K(s,t) f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\).\n\nIf another function \\\\( g(t) = e^t \\\\) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), and subsequent calculations are performed using the integral kernel, will the result at T depend only on the initial transformation and not on the intervention function?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention introduces a new function which, when transformed, affects the end results due to the nature of integration mixing the exponential terms from both original and intervention functions, therefore making the computation influenced by both.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
