  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We analyze the impact when this function undergoes a Fourier transform over time t.\n\nIf an operation, such as multiplying by another exponential function \\\\( e^{i\\\\eta t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\eta \\\\) is a real constant, is applied at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the Fourier transform result still only show a component at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying by another exponential function alters the frequency of the original function, leading to a new frequency component at \\\\( \\\\omega + \\\\eta \\\\). The Fourier transform of the resulting function, \\\\( z(t) = e^{i(\\\\omega + \\\\eta) t} \\\\), will show a Dirac delta function at \\\\( \\\\omega + \\\\eta \\\\), not at the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "At time t_1, multiplying z(t) by e^(iηt) shifts the frequency spectrum of z(t) by η, so the Fourier transform no longer only shows a component at ω."
