  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) which evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int e^{-st}z(t)dt \\\\), where s is a complex constant, on the function over a time interval is analyzed.\n\nCan we determine precisely the initial function's parameters and the transformations applied only by observing the system’s state at \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final observed state at \\\\( T \\\\) combines effects from the original differential equation and any transformations applied. Due to the overlap in potential influences and transformations like \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\), identifying unique initial parameters or interventions from the final state alone is generally infeasible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of ω directly influences the rate of change of z(t) with respect to time; the complex constant s directly influences the integral transformation T(z); the variable t directly determines the state of z(t); the function z(t) directly results in the transformation T(z)."
