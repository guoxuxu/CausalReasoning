  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz + N \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) are complex constants. We investigate how the transformation by the complex exponential function \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) impacts the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can the specific interventions (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) be uniquely determined based only on the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The complex dynamics introduced by possibly multiple, and complex exponential transformations make it difficult to uniquely reverse-engineer the precise interventions used. Multiple combinations of interventions could lead to an equivalent state at \\\\( T \\\\), given the non-commutative nature of the operations involved and the fact that the same final state could arise from different sequences.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of z with respect to time (z'(t)) directly causes the value of z at the next time step (z(t+dt)). The function f(z) directly causes the value of z at time t, and the function g(z) also directly causes the value of z at time t. The constant M directly causes the rate of change of z with respect to time (z'(t)), while the constant N directly causes the value of z."
