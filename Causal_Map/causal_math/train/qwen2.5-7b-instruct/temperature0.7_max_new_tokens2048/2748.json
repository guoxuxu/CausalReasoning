  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on the complex plane \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) and a transformation defined by the integral transform \\\\( g(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-sz} f(z) dz \\\\). Suppose we further investigate how other transformations like multiplication by a complex constant affect this scenario.\n\nCan we determine whether the transformation by a complex scalar k was applied to \\\\( f(z) \\\\) before obtaining \\\\( g(s) \\\\), based solely on the transformed function \\\\( g(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the application of a specific scalar transformation on \\\\( f(z) \\\\) based on the analysis of \\\\( g(s) \\\\) is not feasible without additional context or constraints, because the integral transform masks direct scalar effects into the broader transformation characteristics.",
