  "Problem": "Evaluate the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t} \\\\) under the action of a differential operator \\\\( D = \\\\frac{d}{dt} - ci \\\\), where \\\\( a, b, c \\\\) are real constants.\n\nIf at a specified time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention modifies the function to \\\\( z_{new}(t) = e^{(a+di)t} \\\\), will the affected system from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to \\\\( t = T \\\\) depend solely on the original differential operator \\\\( D \\\\) in determining \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the base function and potentially introduces new dynamics which are not solely determined by \\\\( D \\\\). The new constants and the interaction between old and new parameters dictate the evolved function at \\\\( t = T \\\\), concerning both \\\\( D \\\\) and the modified exponent.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
