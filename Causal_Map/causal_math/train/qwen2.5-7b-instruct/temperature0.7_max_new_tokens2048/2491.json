  "Problem": "Consider a nondeterministic control system where the state vector \\\\( z \\\\) evolves over time according to a stochastic differential equation \\\\( dz = Mz \\\\, dt + N \\\\, dW \\\\), with M and N being constant matrices and \\\\( dW \\\\) representing the differential of a Wiener process. We investigate how applying a transformation \\\\( h(z) = S^{-1}z \\\\) affects the path of the system, where S is a constant, invertible matrix.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention by the function \\\\( q(z) = Tz \\\\) (where T is another constant, invertible matrix) is applied to the system, will the resulting state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be fundamentally unaffected by the earlier transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( q(z) \\\\) compounds with the effects of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and the inherent stochasticity of the process. The resultant state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on both the prior and the latest transformations, as well as the unpredictable influence of the Weiner process.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation h(z) directly influences the state z at any given time, including time T. The intervention q(z) at time t1 introduces an additional transformation that affects the state z at time T. Therefore, the state z(T) for T > t1 is affected by both h(z) and q(z)."
