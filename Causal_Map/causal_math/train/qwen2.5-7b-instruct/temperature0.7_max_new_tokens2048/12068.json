  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\), where A is a linear operator in a complex function space, and \\\\( x \\\\) is an initial complex function. We explore the impacts of a Laplace transform intervention defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), analyzing its interactions over various scenarios.\n\nIf we directly compute \\\\( z(T) \\\\) from the given \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\) equation and compare it to the outcome of evolving the original function \\\\( x \\\\) under the same operation for time T without any transformations, are they the same?",
  "Explanation": "By definition, applying \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) to \\\\( x \\\\) for a period T precisely yields \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Therefore, there's no difference between the direct computation from the original formula and the evolution of \\\\( x \\\\) under \\\\( e^{At} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z at time T (z(T)) is determined by the initial function x through the operator A over time T; the direct computation of z(T) from z(t) is equivalent to evolving x under A for time T."
