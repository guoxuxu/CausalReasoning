  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = \\\\exp(ix) \\\\) operating in the complex plane. We explore the effects of applying a Fourier Transform to this function, defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(x) e^{-i \\\\omega x} dx \\\\).\n\nGiven a Fourier spectrum showing a delta function at \\\\( \\\\omega = 1 \\\\), can we confirm that the original function was specifically \\\\( z(x) = \\\\exp(ix) \\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Although a delta function at \\\\( \\\\omega = 1 \\\\) in the Fourier spectrum strongly suggests that the original function had a frequency component of \\\\( \\\\omega = 1 \\\\), it does not exclusively confirm that the function was \\\\( \\\\exp(ix) \\\\). Other phase shifts or amplitude variations could yield a similar result.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The Fourier Transform of z(x) = exp(ix) results in a Delta function at ω=1, and conversely, a Delta function at ω=1 in the Fourier spectrum indicates that the original function is z(x) = exp(ix) under certain conditions."
