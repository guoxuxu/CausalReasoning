  "Problem": "Consider a system of coupled linear differential equations represented by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\), where A is a constant matrix. Now introduce a change of basis driven by a matrix function \\\\( P(t) \\\\), leading to a new variable \\\\( y = P(t)x \\\\). Analyze the transformation's impacts under various scenarios.\n\nIf the change of basis \\\\( P(t) = e^{Bt} \\\\) is enforced at t = 0 on the initial condition \\\\( x_0 \\\\), leading to an initial condition \\\\( y_0 = P(0)x_0 \\\\), will the solution \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to solving \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) from \\\\( x_0 \\\\) directly?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( P(t) \\\\) alters the initial conditions and the transformation \\\\( y = P(t)x \\\\) involves a matrix exponential that modifies the evolution path of \\\\( y(t) \\\\) in a manner dependent on both A and B. The solutions will only coincide if specific relationships between A and B hold, such as commutativity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The change of basis P(t) directly transforms x into y; A directly influences x and y through the differential equation; t parametrizes both x and y; P(0) determines y_0 based on x_0; A and the initial condition x_0 together determine y(t) at any time t."
