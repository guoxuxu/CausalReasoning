  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) mapped in the complex plane. Analyze the impact of the linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = Az + B \\\\) where A and B are complex constants, over time t.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations (\\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( S(z) \\\\), or both) were applied, merely by knowing the outcome at \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could potentially be achieved from varying combinations or applications of transformations due to the nature of complex function operations. It's challenging to pinpoint whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( S(z) \\\\), or a combination was implemented, especially without additional data about phase and magnitude changes at intermediate points.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "A transformation T(z) or S(z) → z(T) based on the outcome at z(T), but it is not possible to precisely determine which specific transformation was applied without additional information."
