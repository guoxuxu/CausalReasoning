  "Problem": "Consider a nonlinear system controlled by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = r(t)e^{i\\\\theta(t)} \\\\), where \\\\( r(t) \\\\) is the amplitude and \\\\( \\\\theta(t) \\\\) is the phase. A transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = ze^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) with a complex constant \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is considered over time t.\n\nCan we conclusively determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 by observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time T if we are uncertain whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the certainty of whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, the differences in the potential amplitude and phase due to the transformation by \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) make it impossible to accurately trace back to the exact original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The amplitude and phase of z(t) directly cause z(t); the product of alpha and time directly causes the transformation f(z); the transformation f(z) directly causes z(T)."
