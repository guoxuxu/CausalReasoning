  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the state vector \\\\( x \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx + Cu\\\\), where D is a constant matrix and u is a control input. The impact of an integral transformation given by \\\\( h(x) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Ft}x(t) dt \\\\), where F is a constant matrix, is analyzed.\n\nIf the state vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) is set at t = 0 and evolves under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx + Cu\\\\) for a time interval T without any other intervention, will \\\\( h(x) \\\\) calculated over [0, T] be the same regardless of the control input used?",
  "Explanation": "The output of the integral transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) depends on the trajectory of \\\\( x(t) \\\\), which in turn is influenced by the control input \\\\( u \\\\). Different control inputs lead to different state trajectories, thus affecting the value of \\\\( h(x) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The control input u directly influences the state vector x, which then directly influences h(x) through the integral transformation."
