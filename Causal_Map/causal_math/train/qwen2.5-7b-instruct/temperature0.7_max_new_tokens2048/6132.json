  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) defined on the complex plane, where \\\\(z(t)\\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = z^2 + c\\\\), with \\\\(c\\\\) being a constant complex number. Study the behavior of this system under the integral transformation \\\\(T_c(z) = \\\\int_0^t (z(s) + c) \\\\, ds\\\\), focusing on how \\\\(c\\\\) influences the trajectory.\n\nGiven the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we accurately determine which transformations were applied (either \\\\(T_c(z)\\\\), \\\\(S_d(z)\\\\), or both), based solely on the outcome at time \\\\(T\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "No, because the non-linear nature of the differential equation and the integral transformations allow for multiple combinations of transformations and initial conditions that could lead to the same endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\). Disentangling the exact sequence or type of transformations from the endpoint alone is not feasible without additional information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The constant complex number c directly influences the trajectory of z(t) through the differential equation, and this influence is also reflected in the integral transformation T_c(z). The value of T_c(z) at time T directly determines z(T)."
