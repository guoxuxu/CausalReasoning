  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing scenario involving a sequence of functions \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and its transformations. The Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{x(t)\\\\}(s)\\\\) and a convolution operation with an impulse response \\\\(h(t)\\\\) are used. Analyze the impact of the convolution \\\\(y(t) = x(t) * h(t)\\\\) on the transformed signal over frequency domain \\\\(s\\\\).\n\nIf after performing the convolution but before the Fourier transform, an additional filtering operation defined by \\\\(g(t)\\\\) is applied on \\\\(y(t)\\\\), resulting in a new signal \\\\(z(t)\\\\), will the final Fourier transform \\\\(Z(s)\\\\) not depend on \\\\(h(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final signal \\\\(Z(s)\\\\) will still depend on \\\\(h(t)\\\\), since the original convolution impact is present even though it is modified by the filtering with \\\\(g(t)\\\\). The Fourier transform \\\\(Z(s)\\\\) results from the initial transformations compounded by the new filtering, reflecting all the earlier operations.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The input signal x(t) directly causes the convolved signal y(t), which is then filtered by g(t) to produce z(t). The filtered signal z(t) undergoes a Fourier transform to produce Z(s), and this final Fourier transform does not depend on h(t)."
