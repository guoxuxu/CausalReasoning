  "Problem": "Consider a system of complex functions where \\\\(z(t)\\\\) evolves over time according to \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz(t)\\\\), with M being a constant complex matrix. We analyze the change when applying a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{iNt}z \\\\), where N is another constant complex matrix and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit.\n\nIf we observe the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at some time T, can we infer the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied at the beginning?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), one cannot determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) uniquely since the transformation might have modified the initial conditions in a way that cannot be reversed merely from knowledge of \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( z(T) \\\\), especially when N does not commute with M.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
