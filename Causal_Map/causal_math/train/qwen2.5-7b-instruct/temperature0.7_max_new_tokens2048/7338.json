  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex number. We explore the impact of an integral transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(s-t)N}z(s) ds \\\\), where N is also a constant complex number.\n\nAfter observing the final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T, can we deduce the initial function \\\\( z_0(s) \\\\) from 0 to T without knowing whether the integral transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?\", ",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing about the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), it is impossible to reconstruct the exact original function \\\\( z_0(s) \\\\), as the transformation could have significantly altered the evolution path, particularly because the impacts of N in the integral transformation are not generally deducible from the final state under M alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z at time T depends on the differential equation's rate of change, M influences the rate of change of z, the integral transformation h modifies z over time, and N determines how h transforms z."
