  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real functions governed by the differential equations \\\\(du/dt = Au\\\\) and \\\\(dv/dt = Bv\\\\), with A and B being constant scalars. The transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{Ct}z\\\\) is applied, where C is a constant scalar.\n\nIf \\\\(f(z)\\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the separate dynamics \\\\(du/dt = Au\\\\) and \\\\(dv/dt = Bv\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\(z_0\\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under separate dynamics?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(f(z)\\\\) modifies the initial conditions of both \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\), changing their trajectories. The multiplier \\\\(e^{Ct}\\\\) influences the evolution of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) in a way different from the untransformed situation, which results in a different state at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial values u(0) and v(0) determine u(T) and v(T) through the differential equations du/dt = Au and dv/dt = Bv. Consequently, u(T) and v(T) combine to form z(T). Applying the transformation f(z) at t=0 and allowing z to evolve separately under the given dynamics results in the same z(T) as directly evolving z_0 to t=T."
