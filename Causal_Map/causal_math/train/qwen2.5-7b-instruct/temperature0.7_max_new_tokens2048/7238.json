  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit modeled by complex function \\(\\Omega(z) = \\frac{1}{LCz^2 + RCz + 1}\\), where \\(L\\), \\(C\\), and \\(R\\) are inductance, capacitance, and resistance respectively. The response of the circuit is analyzed under the input transformation given by Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\} = F(s) \\).\n\nCan we deduce the original input \\( f(t) \\) after observing \\( Y(s) \\) without knowing whether \\( F(s) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "With different possible transformations \\( F(s) \\) that could have been applied, the observed output \\( Y(s) \\) can map back to multiple potential inputs \\( f(t) \\). Knowledge about \\( F(s) \\) is essential to reverse the Laplace Transform accurately and recover the specific input.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace Transform F(s) of the input f(t) determines Y(s), while L, C, and R through the function Ω(z) affect Y(s) indirectly via Ω(z)."
