  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ y(t) \\\\} = Y(s) \\\\) with a convolution operation defined by the function \\\\( g(t) = e^{-kt} \\\\), where k is a constant. The impact of initial and intermediate alterations using the convolution operation is studied.\n\nIf the convolution \\\\( y(t) * g(t) \\\\) is calculated at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve following the original transfer function without further intervention, will the Laplace Transform at s = T reveal changes compared to the unmodified state?",
  "Explanation": "Convoluting \\\\( y(t) \\\\) with \\\\( g(t) \\\\) changes the system's response by modifying the time domain function, which inevitably alters its Laplace Transform. This is because convolution in time corresponds to multiplication in the s-domain, thus changing the resulting transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the convolution operation with g(t) = e^{-kt} at t=0 results in a modified Laplace Transform Y'(s) which differs from the original Y(s) when evaluated at s=T."
