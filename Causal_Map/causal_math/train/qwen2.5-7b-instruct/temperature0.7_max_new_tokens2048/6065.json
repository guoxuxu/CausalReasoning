  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( bi \\\\) are real and imaginary components of the complex exponent respectively. The system is subject to the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{(c+di)t}z \\\\), with \\\\( c \\\\), \\\\( d \\\\) being constants. Analyze the evolution and causality of this system over time.\n\nIf the initial state is \\\\( z(0) = 1 \\\\) and evolves according to \\\\( z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t} \\\\) without any transformation, will the value at time \\\\( T \\\\) be the same as with transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) applied at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\), the function evolves solely based on the exponent \\\\( (a+bi) \\\\). The transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies this by introducing a new exponent \\\\( (c+di) \\\\), which changes the evolution path and thus the value at time \\\\( T \\\\).",
