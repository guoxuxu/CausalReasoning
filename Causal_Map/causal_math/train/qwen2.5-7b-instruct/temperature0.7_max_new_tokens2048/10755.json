  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) applied on the complex plane excludes zero and analyze its impact using a Laplace transform defined by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}[f(t)](s) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( f(z) \\\\) to \\\\( g(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z^2} \\\\) at some point in the domain, and then its Laplace transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\) is computed, will this new transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\) still reflect the original properties of \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the functional form and thus the nature of its singularities, resulting in a Laplace transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\) that reflects the properties of \\\\( g(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z^2} \\\\), not the original \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\). This changes both the order of the pole and the behavior at infinity.",
