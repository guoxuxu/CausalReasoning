  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We investigate the effects of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\) on the signal and explore varying the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).\n\nGiven the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in the complex plane from t = 0 to T, can we determine precisely if there was an intervention such as a change in frequency midway, based solely on this trajectory?",
  "Explanation": "The trajectory alone, particularly if only observed for a single cycle or incomplete information, might not reveal if a change in frequency occurred without additional timing information or a baseline for comparison. Multiple setups or frequency shifts could result in similar trajectories.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The frequency ω directly influences the trajectory of z(t) in the complex plane. An intervention leading to a change in ω results in a new trajectory in the complex plane. Conversely, observing a change in the trajectory suggests a potential change in ω."
