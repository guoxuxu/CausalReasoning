  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear transformation equations \\\\(x(t) = Ax(0)\\\\), where A is a constant matrix. The behavior of the system is examined when subjected to an external force through the transformation \\\\( g(x) = e^{Bt}x \\\\), where B is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), and knowing that interventions might have been applied, can we definitively determine which transformations (\\\\( g(x) \\\\), \\\\( h(x) \\\\), or none) were applied?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) could arise from various combinations of the applied transformations. Due to potential non-commutativity of the matrix exponentials and the overlapping impacts of these transformations, it is not feasible to distinguish unequivocally which interventions were applied throughout the evolution of the system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state x(t) evolves over time t to become the final state x(T) under the transformation defined by matrix A. The transformation g(x) is applied through the factor e^(Bt), modifying x(t) to become x(T). No other transformations h(x) are mentioned."
