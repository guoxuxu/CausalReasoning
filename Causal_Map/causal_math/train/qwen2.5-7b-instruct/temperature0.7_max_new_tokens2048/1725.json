  "Problem": "Consider an integral equation system defined by \\\\( y(x) = \\\\int_0^x K(x,t) y(t) dt \\\\) where K is a kernel function involving complex operations. We evaluate the impact of modifying the kernel to \\\\( K'(x,t) = K(x,t) \\\\cdot e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( K(x,t) \\\\) is replaced by \\\\( K'(x,t) \\\\) without any further modification to the system, will the solution \\\\( y(x) \\\\) for a given boundary condition remain the same?",
  "Explanation": "The alteration of the kernel to \\\\( K'(x,t) \\\\) changes how the integrand behaves, especially due to the complex exponential factor which can alter the magnitude and phase of the terms within the integral. This change will likely result in a different solution \\\\( y(x) \\\\) that does not match the original.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
