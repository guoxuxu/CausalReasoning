  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations expressed as \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), where A is a linear transformation in a vector space. A specific operator \\\\(T(x) = e^{Mt}x\\\\) is applied, with M being another linear matrix, affecting x through an exponential transformation.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional transformation \\\\(U(x) = e^{Nt}x\\\\) (where N is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the resultant vector \\\\(x(T)\\\\) at T > t_1 exclusively rely on the matrix A?",
  "Explanation": "This intervention with \\\\(U(x)\\\\) introduces another layer of transformation, making the outcome at T dependent on N, as well as M and A. The consecutive applications of \\\\(e^{Mt}\\\\) and \\\\(e^{Nt}\\\\) can significantly modify the trajectory and final state of the system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
