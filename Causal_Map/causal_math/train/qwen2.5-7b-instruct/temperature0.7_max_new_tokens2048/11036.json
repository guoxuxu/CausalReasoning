  "Problem": "Consider a linear system of differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We analyze the impact of a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\\\( T \\\\) applied to the initial conditions over time.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what transformations were used (whether T, S, or none), only by knowing the value of \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific transformations used is generally impossible only from the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) because different initial transformations and interventions can yield the same final state, particularly due to non-commutative properties and various potential compositional interactions among M, T, and S.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Both T and S transformations can lead to the same x(T), making it impossible to determine precisely which transformation was used based solely on the value of x(T)."
