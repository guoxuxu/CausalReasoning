  "Problem": "Assume we have a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the complex differential equation \\\\( z'(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency. The influence of the linear transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) being another real constant and \\\\( t \\\\) denoting time, is considered.\n\nIf an intervention \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is another constant, is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and it’s known \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was previously applied at t = 0, will the result at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\) and neither \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) nor \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is influenced by all abovementioned factors: the original evolution \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\), the initial transformation by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), and the intervention by \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\). All these contribute through exponential contributions both to the amplitude and phase of the waveform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
