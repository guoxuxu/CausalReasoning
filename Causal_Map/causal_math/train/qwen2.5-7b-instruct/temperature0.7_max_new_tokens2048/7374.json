  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix. The transformation specified by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\), where N is another constant complex matrix, is applied to study the behavior of the function over time t.\n\nBy examining the vector \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we determine the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied or not?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing about the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), it is impossible to correctly determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) since \\\\( g(z) = e^{Nt} \\\\) may have radically changed the initial state. The effect of N on the evolution path is critical, and without this information, the inverse transformation cannot be precisely determined.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of z with respect to t is determined by M, the value of z at time T depends on its initial value z_0, and the transformation g(z) modifies z through the exponential of Nt."
