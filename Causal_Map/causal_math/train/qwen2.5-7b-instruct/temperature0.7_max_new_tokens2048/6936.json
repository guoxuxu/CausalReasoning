  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\), where \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\( z \\), respectively. The evolution of \\( z \\) is governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = Mz \\), where \\( M \\) is a constant matrix. We analyze the impact of the integral transformation defined by \\( f(z) = \\int_0^t e^{Ns} z(s) \\, ds \\), where \\( N \\) is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\( z(T) \\), can we determine precisely which transformations were applied (whether \\( f(z) \\), \\( g(z) \\), or both), solely by knowing the final state \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\( z(T) \\) could result from numerous combinations of \\( N \\), \\( Q \\), and \\( M \\) actions due to the integral influence and overlapping effects of the transformations. The lack of a one-to-one correspondence between initial transformations and final states means multiple scenarios could yield the same endpoint.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The real part u(t) and the imaginary part v(t) together determine z(t); the differential equation Mz dictates the rate of change of z(t); the integral transformation f(z) depends on z(t) over time; the endpoint z(T) results from the application of transformations like f(z) and/or g(z)."
