  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z = f(x, y)\\\\) defined on the complex plane, where \\\\(f(x, y) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y)\\\\) and \\\\(u\\\\) and \\\\(v\\\\) are harmonic functions. The transformation considered here is the complex exponential transformation \\\\(g(z) = e^z\\\\).\n\nIf the complex function \\\\(g(z)\\\\) is applied to a point \\\\(z_0\\\\) and then \\\\(z(t)\\\\) evolves under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = az\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\(z_0\\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = az\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(g(z) = e^z\\\\) changes the initial value of the system by applying the exponential map, which affects the trajectory under the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = az\\\\). Thus, the state at any time T will differ from the case where the initial state was not transformed.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial point z_0 directly influences z(t) through the evolution equation. Applying the complex exponential transformation g(z) to z_0 indirectly influences z(t) via the same evolution equation with the transformed value. The parameter a directly determines how z(t) evolves over time."
