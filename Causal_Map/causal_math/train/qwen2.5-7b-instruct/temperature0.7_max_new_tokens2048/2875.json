  "Problem": "Consider a heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\) which describes the heat distribution in a rod over time. We also examine a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) \\\\) which transforms the heat distribution function \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) into the frequency domain.\n\nIf an external heat source changes the distribution at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by altering \\\\( u(x, t_1) \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend strictly on the heat equation constant \\\\( k \\\\) and not on the characteristics of the heat source?",
  "Explanation": "The external heat source adds or alters heat distribution in the rod, which in turn affects the solution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\). The type and strength of the heat source intervention directly influence the future distribution of heat, alongside the diffusion properties determined by \\\\( k \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial heat distribution at time t1 influences the heat distribution at a later time T, and this change is governed by the heat equation constant k."
