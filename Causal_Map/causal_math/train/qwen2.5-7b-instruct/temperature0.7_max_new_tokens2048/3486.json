  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), evolving over time governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a constant matrix. The transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) with another constant matrix \\\\( Q \\\\) is applied to assess various impacts on the function.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied, it becomes untraceable to accurately reconstruct \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The transformation \\\\( e^{QT} \\\\) can alter the initial conditions significantly. Distinguishing the effects of P and Q from the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without prior information on the transformation is fundamentally ambiguous.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Given z(T) is the state of z at time T, and considering P governs the evolution of z from z(0) to z(T), if g(z) is applied with matrix Q, then z(T) depends on both P and g(z). Knowing z(T) allows us to infer z_0 if g(z) was not applied, but if g(z) was applied, we need to account for its effect on z(T) to deduce z_0."
