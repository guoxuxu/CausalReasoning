  "Problem": "We consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), which describes a unit circle in the complex plane over time. We examine how the Laplace Transform affects this function and the implications for causally interpreting transformations over time.\n\nGiven the Laplace Transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) from a modified function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), can we recover the exact function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the modifications applied or the specific conditions under which the Laplace Transform was taken, recovering the exact periodic function \\\\( e^{it} \\\\) is ambiguous due to potential alterations in the domain or behavior of the function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
