  "Problem": "Consider a system based on a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The impact study involves the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a real constant, applied at varying times.\n\nIf at time t = t_1 a new transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{ct}z \\\\) (where c is a real constant different from k) is applied as an intervention, will the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend strictly on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( k \\\\) or \\\\( c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) results from the interplay of \\\\( k \\\\), \\\\( c \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Since transformations by \\\\( k \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\) scale the magnitude and may alter the phase of \\\\( z \\\\), the resulting state's magnitude and angle depend on all these factors. The compounded effects mean the transformation history influences the trajectory.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of z with respect to time (dz/dt) is directly caused by ω. The value of z at time T depends directly on z at time t_1 and the transformations applied (g(z) and h(z)), which are influenced by k and c respectively. However, the final state z(T) strictly depends on ω and not on k or c."
