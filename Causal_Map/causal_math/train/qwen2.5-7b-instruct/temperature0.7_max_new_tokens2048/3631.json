  "Problem": "Consider a quadratic form described by \\\\( Q(x) = x^T A x \\\\), where A is a symmetric matrix. We analyze the behavior of this form under a linear transformation defined by the matrix T over the vector space.\n\nIf after applying the transformation T, a restructuring of the matrix A to A' is made (where A' is another symmetric matrix), will the calculated \\\\( Q(Tx) \\\\) using A' reflect the characteristics of the original A?",
  "Explanation": "The restructuring of A to A' changes the fundamental characteristics of the quadratic form. Calculating \\\\( Q(Tx) \\\\) with A' yields results that reflect properties of A', which might differ significantly from A unless A' is a specific transformation related to A.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying a linear transformation T to a vector x changes the input of the quadratic form Q, while restructuring the matrix A to A' modifies the quadratic form's definition. Thus, Q(Tx) using A' reflects the characteristics of A' rather than the original A."
