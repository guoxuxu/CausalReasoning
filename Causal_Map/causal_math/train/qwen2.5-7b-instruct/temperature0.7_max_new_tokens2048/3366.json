  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing application where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed using a Fourier transform, represented as \\\\( X(f) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{x(t)\\\\} \\\\). The transformed signal is then processed through a linear time-invariant system characterized by a frequency response \\\\( H(f) \\\\). We are particularly interested in the impact of modifying the signal processing steps with the inclusion of an inverse Fourier transform defined by \\\\( x'(t) = \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\\\{X'(f)\\\\} \\\\), where \\\\( X'(f) = H(f) \\\\cdot X(f) \\\\).\n\nGiven the modified signal \\\\( x'(t) \\\\), can we infer the original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without knowledge about \\\\( H(f) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing \\\\( H(f) \\\\), it is impossible to correctly reverse the effects signified by \\\\( X'(f) = H(f) \\\\cdot X(f) \\\\). The modification by \\\\( H(f) \\\\) could fundamentally alter certain frequencies making it impossible to unambiguously reconstruct \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from \\\\( x'(t) \\\\) without this information.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The original signal x(t) is transformed into X(f) via Fourier transform, which is then multiplied by the frequency response H(f) to produce X'(f). X'(f) is subsequently inverse-transformed into the modified signal x'(t). Without knowing H(f), it is not possible to infer x(t) from x'(t)."
