  "Problem": "Examine the relationship in a closed economic system represented by the function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{Dt}x(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is an input economic variable, C is a constant matrix defining the transformation from input to output, and D is a rate matrix governing the system's dynamics over time t.\n\nCan we accurately trace back the initial economic variable \\\\( x_0 \\\\) after observing the output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, without interventions and assuming no knowledge of whether transformations by C or dynamics by D were applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific information on the application of the transformation matrix C and the dynamics governed by D, reconstructing \\\\( x_0 \\\\) precisely is not feasible. The transformation and dynamic rates could significantly modify the trajectory, making it impossible to revert purely based on the outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
