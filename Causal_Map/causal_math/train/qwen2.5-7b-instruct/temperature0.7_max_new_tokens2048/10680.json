  "Problem": "Consider the diffusion equation for heat transfer in a rod, \\\\( \\\\partial u / \\\\partial t = k \\\\partial^2 u / \\\\partial x^2 \\\\), where u is the temperature, x is the spatial variable, and k is the thermal diffusivity constant. We investigate the effect of an initial function \\\\( u(x,0) = e^{ax} \\\\), where a is also a constant.\n\nGiven the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) at some time t after an unknown intervention changing thermal diffusivity, can we determine whether the original parameter was a or another value?",
  "Explanation": "The diffusive nature of the heat equation and the possibility of an unknown change in thermal diffusivity introduce significant uncertainty in deducing the exact initial parameter a. The alteration not only affects the diffusion speed but also the manner in which the initial conditions are propagated, obscuring the initial setup.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial temperature distribution u(x,0) = e^(ax) influences the temperature distribution u(x,t) at later times through the diffusion equation, but does not directly determine the thermal diffusivity k after an intervention that changes it; determining the original value of k requires knowledge of u(x,t) and the specific form of the intervention."
