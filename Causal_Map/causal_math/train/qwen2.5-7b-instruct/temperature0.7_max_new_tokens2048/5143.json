  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving over time governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\), where C is a complex constant. We investigate how the application of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Dt} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where D is a complex constant, affects the system.\n\nIf an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) applies a new transformation \\\\( U(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Ft} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) (where F is a complex constant), will the resultant state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend exclusively on C and not on D or F?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention with \\\\( U(z) \\\\) introduces additional influences through \\\\( e^{Ft} \\\\), making the final state at T dependent on the history incorporated by D and the new dynamics introduced by F, along with the underlying evolution governed by C. The integration effects and exponential components skew the trajectory distinctly.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
