  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency, and the function evolves over time t. We investigate how transformations involving the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\\\) of a function affect computations and inferences.\n\nGiven the transformed version of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) using \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\\\), can the original time function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be uniquely determined from the transform at a later time T?",
  "Explanation": "Laplace Transforms are unique for a given function under certain conditions such as functions of exponential type, which includes \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\). Therefore, we can uniquely recover \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from its transform at any specific time T, assuming we know the parameters of the transformation.",
