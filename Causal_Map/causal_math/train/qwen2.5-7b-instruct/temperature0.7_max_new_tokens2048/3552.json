  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical setting where the behavior of a scalar field \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) is governed by a partial differential equation. The equation is \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where D is a diffusion constant. An integral transformation \\\\( v(x, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-sx} u(x, t) dx \\\\) is applied to study the system's evolution.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( v(x, T) \\\\), can the specific alteration in the diffusion constant, either at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) or another time, be determined by only knowing the final value of \\\\( v(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The values of \\\\( v(x, T) \\\\) could be achieved through various trajectories of \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) influenced by different adjustments in the diffusion constant. The diffusive nature and the inherent properties of the transformations due to the partial differential equation create ambiguities in back-calculating specific interventions without additional information about the process.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The scalar field u(x, t) is influenced by the diffusion constant D and time t. The transformation v(x, t) depends on u(x, t), and the final value v(x, T) reflects the state of u(x, t) at time T. Knowing v(x, T) alone does not allow determining specific alterations in D at t_1 or another time."
