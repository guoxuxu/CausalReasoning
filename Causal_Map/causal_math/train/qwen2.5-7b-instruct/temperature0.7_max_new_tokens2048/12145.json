  "Problem": "Analyze the system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\), within a certain region. Consider a transformation by the function \\\\(f(u) = e^{ikx} u\\\\) where k is a constant and x represents a spatial variable.\n\nCan we recover the exact original function \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) at x = 0 after observing \\\\(u(x)\\\\) at some other point x, without knowing whether \\\\(f(u)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(f(u) = e^{ikx} u\\\\) was applied, it is indeterminate if the alterations in \\\\(u(x)\\\\) are due solely to natural system properties under the Laplace equation or a result of the transformation, making it unclear to precisely derive \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
