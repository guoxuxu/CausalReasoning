  "Problem": "Consider a system described by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant. The system undergoes a Laplace transform, defined by \\\\( L(z)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\). This changes the function domain and potentially the system dynamics.\n\nCan we determine the exact time and nature (whether A or B was applied) of intervention from the Laplace transformed function \\\\( L(z)(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The overlap in potential transformations caused by similar forms but different parameters in A and B, added to the integration effect in the Laplace transform, obscures precise details about intervention timings and nature. The transformed output does not retain explicit markers of such changes, rendering precise inference of intervention specifics infeasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The complex constant A influences the function z(t) over time, while the Laplace transform parameter s influences the Laplace transformed function L(z)(s)."
