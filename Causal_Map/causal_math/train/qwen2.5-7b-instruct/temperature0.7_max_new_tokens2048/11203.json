  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation of a vector space given by the matrix \\\\( P \\\\) which projects vectors onto a subspace. We explore the effects of applying another linear transformation \\\\( Q \\\\), which is a rotation matrix, on this vector space.\n\nIf, at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention by applying a scaling matrix \\\\( S \\\\) (where S is a constant diagonal matrix) is introduced, will the final state at T > t_1 be independent of the sequence in which \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\) were initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with scaling modifies the scenario such that the final vector \\\\( v(T) \\\\) will still depend on whether \\\\( P \\\\) or \\\\( Q \\\\) was applied first. The scaling transformation amplifies the components differently based on the basis set by the initial operations, and the prior sequence of projection and rotation influences the scaling effect.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "A scaling matrix S influences the final state, while the order of applying projection matrix P and rotation matrix Q determines the intermediate state, which in turn affects the final state."
