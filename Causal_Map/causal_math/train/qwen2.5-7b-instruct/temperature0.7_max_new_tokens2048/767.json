  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation in complex function space described by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex value. We analyze the effect of the transformation function \\\\( f(z) = ze^{Bt} \\\\) (where \\\\( B \\\\) is another real constant) applied over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention occurs at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) via the function \\\\( g(z) = ze^{Ct} \\\\) (where \\\\( C \\\\) is another constant), will the resultant state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be influenced only by \\\\( A \\\\) and not \\\\( B \\\\) or \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) affects the trajectory not only by compounding with the effects of \\\\( A \\\\) but also integrating the impacts of \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\). As such, the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) reflects an amalgamation of influences from A, B, and C.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state of z at time t1- influences the state of z at time t1+, and the state of z at time t1+ influences its state at time T. The constants A, B, and C determine how z evolves over time, but after the intervention at t1, the evolution is primarily driven by A."
