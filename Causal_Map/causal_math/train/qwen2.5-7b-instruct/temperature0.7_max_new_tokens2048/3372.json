  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = \\\\exp(ix) \\\\) operating in the complex plane. We explore the effects of applying a Fourier Transform to this function, defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(x) e^{-i \\\\omega x} dx \\\\).\n\nGiven a Fourier spectrum with a peak at an arbitrary \\\\( \\\\omega = c \\\\), can we definitively determine the specific values of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) in the intervened function \\\\( z'(x) = \\\\exp(i(ax+b)) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the peak at \\\\( \\\\omega = c \\\\) confirms that the frequency of the original function was adjusted to \\\\( c \\\\), it does not provide any information about the phase shift \\\\( b \\\\). Multiple combinations of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) might produce the same frequency \\\\( c \\\\) without revealing specific values.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
