  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\(z(t)\\\\), which is applied to an input function \\\\(x(t)\\\\) in a linear system defined by the integral transform \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty h(t-u) x(u) du \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is the system's impulse response. An additional transformation \\\\( g(t) = e^{Ct}x(t) \\\\) (where C is a constant matrix) is considered as an intervention.\n\nIf \\\\( y(T) \\\\) is observed, can we determine the exact form of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without knowing \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\), reversing the convolution to uniquely identify \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from \\\\( y(T) \\\\) is generally impossible, as multiple impulse-response and input-function combinations can produce the same output.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input function x(t) directly influences both the output y(t) through the system's impulse response h(t-u) and the transformed function g(t) via the constant matrix C. The system's impulse response h(t-u) directly causes y(t), and the constant matrix C directly causes g(t)."
