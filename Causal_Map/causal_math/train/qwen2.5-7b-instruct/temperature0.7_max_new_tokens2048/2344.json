  "Problem": "Consider a continuous-time system characterized by linear transformations over time, governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We evaluate the effects of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(x) = Mx \\\\) at different times, where M is a constant matrix.\n\nCan we determine precisely the interventions used (whether \\\\( g(x) \\\\), \\\\( h(x) \\\\), or both) solely based on the end state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at T = 1?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of M, N and different initial vectors \\\\( x_0 \\\\) could lead to the same final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) due to the properties of linear transformations and matrix exponentiation. Determining exactly which transformations were applied requires additional information beyond the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of x over time (D → x(T)) and the transformation applied (M → x(T)) both influence the state of x at time T=1."
