  "Problem": "Consider the application of a Fourier transform to a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) represented as \\\\( g(t) = ae^{bt} \\\\), where a and b are constants. We analyze the impact of this transformation over time when the transformed function \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\) is combined with another transformed function under different scenarios.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( G'(\\\\omega) \\\\) after specific known interventions in both the time and frequency domains, can we determine \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and the interventions accurately?",
  "Explanation": "Even if the transformations are known, the overlapping effects of multiple interventions (like filtering in the frequency domain and then transforming) can lead to multiple function forms that fit the final transformed result \\\\( G'(\\\\omega) \\\\). This makes it challenging to uniquely determine both the original function and the exact interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The constants a and b determine g(t); the Fourier transform of g(t) results in G(ω); interventions affect G'(ω), which is related to G(ω) through the inverse Fourier transform; accurately determining g(t) requires knowledge of G(ω) and its relationship with G'(ω) via the Fourier transform."
