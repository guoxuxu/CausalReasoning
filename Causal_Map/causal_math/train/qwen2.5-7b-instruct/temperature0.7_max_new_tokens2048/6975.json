  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving under the influence of a potential field governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 V = 0\\\\). The potential field is perturbed by an added magnetic field, described by a vector potential \\\\(\\\\vec{A}\\\\). The effect of \\\\(\\\\vec{A}\\\\) is represented through the transformation \\\\(f(\\\\vec{x}, t) = \\\\vec{A} \\\\times \\\\vec{x}\\\\) at time t.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), a new magnetic field described by another vector potential \\\\(\\\\vec{B} = e^{Ct}\\\\vec{x}\\\\) (where C is a constant matrix) is introduced, will the endpoint trajectory of the particle at t = T for T > t_1 depend only on the initial electric field \\\\(\\\\nabla V\\\\) and not on \\\\(\\\\vec{A}\\\\) or \\\\(\\\\vec{B}\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a new magnetic field modification adds complexity. The trajectory of the particle will depend significantly on the combination of \\\\(\\\\vec{A}\\\\), \\\\(\\\\vec{B}\\\\), and the electric field, influencing the particle's path through compound electromagnetic interactions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The potential V directly influences the function f, which in turn affects the particle's trajectory. The vector potentials A and B also directly influence f, but the endpoint trajectory at t=T depends on the initial conditions including the gradient of V, and not on A or B."
