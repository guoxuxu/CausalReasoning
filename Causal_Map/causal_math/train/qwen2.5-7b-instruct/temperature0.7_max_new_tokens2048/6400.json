  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a function \\( u(x, t) \\) governed by the partial differential equation \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = -\\lambda u \\) with \\( \\lambda > 0 \\), and consider the transformation \\( T(u) = u e^{-\\lambda t} \\) applied to \\( u \\).\n\nGiven \\( u(x, T) \\) under repeated applications of \\( T(u) \\), can we deduce the exact times \\( t_i \\) when \\( T(u) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The result of applying \\( T(u) \\) repeatedly produces a state that masks the effects of \\( -\\lambda u \\), making it indistinguishable when during the timeline the interventions occurred just from observing \\( u(x, T) \\). The end state could be consistent with various sequences and timings of applying \\( T(u) \\), particularly without additional information on the dynamics between the intervals.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function u(x, t) changes over time t through the differential equation, and the transformation T(u) applied at time t_i modifies u(x, t) to u(x, t) transformed; each application of T(u) at time t_i reduces the value of u(x, t) by a factor of e^(-λ(t - t_i))."
