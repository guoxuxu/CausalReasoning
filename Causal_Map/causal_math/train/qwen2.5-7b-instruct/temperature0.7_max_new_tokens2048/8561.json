  "Problem": "Consider a complex integral transformation defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{\\\\gamma} e^{zt} dt \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) is a given contour in the complex plane and z is a complex variable. We explore the effect of the contour shift defined by \\\\( \\\\gamma' \\\\) which results from the transformation \\\\( g(t) = t + i \\\\beta \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a real number.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is applied to the contour \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) at t = 0, and then \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is computed along \\\\( \\\\gamma' \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( F(z) \\\\) on \\\\( \\\\gamma' \\\\) be equivalent to \\\\( F(z) \\\\) computed originally on \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The shift in the contour affects the path of integration in the complex plane. Since the exponential function \\\\( e^{zt} \\\\) is sensitive to the path through which t moves, particularly due to the imaginary component added by \\\\( g(t) \\\\), the resulting integral \\\\( F(z) \\\\) along \\\\( \\\\gamma' \\\\) differs from that along \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\).",
