  "Problem": "Consider a complex function of the form \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. A linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) is defined such that \\\\( Lz = \\\\frac{dz}{dt} + \\\\alpha z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant. We investigate how \\\\( L \\\\) affects the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time.\n\nCan we determine the original function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether operator \\\\( L \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of operator \\\\( L \\\\), it's uncertain if the observed \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at T has been modified by the added constant \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\). The transformation due to \\\\( L \\\\) might have altered either the amplitude or phase or both, which obscures the original characteristics of the function.",

List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
