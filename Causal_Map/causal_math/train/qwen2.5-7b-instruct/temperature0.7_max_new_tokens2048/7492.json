  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a diagonalizable matrix. We introduce an operator transformation \\\\( F(x) = Ax \\\\), where A is another matrix, and analyze its effect on the system over a period of time t.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we precisely backtrack and identify whether transformations \\\\( F(x) \\\\), \\\\( G(x) \\\\), or both were used, based solely on the endpoint and known matrix M?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) could arise from various combinations of initial transformations and interventions, particularly given the non-commutative nature of general matrix operations. Establishing a unique cause-effect relationship between the transformations and the final state is unattainable without additional information about A and B.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The final state x(T) is influenced by both transformations F(x) and G(x), which are applied to the initial state x(0)."
