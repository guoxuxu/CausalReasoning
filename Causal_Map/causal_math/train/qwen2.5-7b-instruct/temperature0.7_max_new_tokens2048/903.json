  "Problem": "In a complex analysis scenario, consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) where \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{i\\\\omega s} ds \\\\), integrating over the variable s. The function represents a transformation in the complex plane over time t, where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency parameter.\n\nAssuming an intervention modifies \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to a new value \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) mid-way at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be unaffected by the change in \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention alters the frequency parameter from \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\), which changes the function \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega s} \\\\) to \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega' s} \\\\) post-intervention. Hence, the trajectory in the complex plane from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T will differ, affecting the final position of \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
