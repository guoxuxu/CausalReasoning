  "Problem": "Examine the effect of a Fourier transformation denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) defined on the real line. Further, let's consider that \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is initially described by a differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}g(t) = -\\lambda g(t) \\\\) where \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) is a positive real number. The Fourier transform is then impacted by an additional transformation \\\\( h(f) = e^{-\\alpha |f|^2} \\\\), where \\\\( f \\\\) represents frequency and \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nGiven the observed transformed function \\\\( |\\\\mathcal{F}[g](f, T)| \\\\) after time T, can we clearly determine whether the transformation \\\\( h(f) = e^{-\\alpha |f|^2} \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(f) \\\\), it is impossible to discern from the observed \\\\( |\\\\mathcal{F}[g](f, T)| \\\\) alone as the frequency spectrum's decay due to \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) alone could appear similar to the transformation effects at different parameters.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The function g(t) changes over time due to its differential equation, undergoes Fourier transformation resulting in F[g(t)], which is further modified by h(f) = e^(-α |f|^2) to produce H[F[g(t)]], and the transformed function |F[g(t)](f, T)| reflects this modification."
