  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical system where the rotation of a vector \\\\(v\\\\) in \\\\(\\\\mathbb{R}^2\\\\) is defined by a complex function \\\\(f(t, v) = e^{i\\\\theta t}v\\\\), and \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) is a constant representing angular velocity. The impact of a linear transformation \\\\(L\\\\), defined as scaling by a factor \\\\(s>0\\\\), is used as an intervention.\n\nIf at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), the scaling linear transformation \\\\(L(v) = sv\\\\) is applied as an intervention and the vector continues to rotate, will the final state at time \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) depend only on the rotational transformation and not on the scaling factor \\\\(s\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the scaling transformation \\\\(L(v) = sv\\\\) alters the magnitude of the vector, which affects its subsequent rotation trajectory. Therefore, the final state at time \\\\(T\\\\) is dependent on both the initial rotation parameter \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) and the scaling factor \\\\(s\\\\), influencing the position and size of the vector at \\\\(T\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The final state at time T depends on both the rotational transformation and the scaling factor s, as the scaling transformation L(v) → v' precedes the rotational transformation f(t, v') → v''."
