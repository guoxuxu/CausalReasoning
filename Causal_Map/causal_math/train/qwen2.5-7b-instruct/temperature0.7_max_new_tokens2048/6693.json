  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(s) \\\\) defined in the complex plane by \\\\( z(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a real-valued function representing the system's response and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable. The scenario examines the effects and causal inferences when the function is modified by a transformation \\\\( g(t) = t^k \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( f(t) \\\\) at t = 0, i.e., \\\\( f(t) \\\\) becomes \\\\( t^k \\\\cdot f(t) \\\\), and then \\\\( z(s) \\\\) is calculated, will the resultant \\\\( z(s) \\\\) be the same as if no transformation was applied to \\\\( f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(t) = t^k \\\\) alters the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), changing the integration outcome in \\\\( z(s) \\\\). The modification introduces an additional factor of \\\\( t^k \\\\), which alters the decay rate and the overall behavior of the integral, leading to a different function \\\\( z(s) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
