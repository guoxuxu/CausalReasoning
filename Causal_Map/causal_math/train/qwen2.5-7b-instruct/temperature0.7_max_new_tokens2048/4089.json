  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = Ce^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(C\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) are constants. We explore the effect of applying a linear transformation \\\\(T(z) = Az + B\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\) are complex constants.\n\nIf \\\\(T(z)\\\\) is applied to \\\\(z_0\\\\) at \\\\(t = 0\\\\), and the system is left to evolve under \\\\(z(t) = Ce^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\) be the same as if \\\\(z_0\\\\) was directly evolved to \\\\(t = T\\\\) using the original function?",
  "Explanation": "The linear transformation alters \\\\(z_0\\\\) by applying \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\). The resulting trajectory will consequently evolve from this new initial state, resulting in a final state of \\\\(Az(T) + B\\\\) rather than just \\\\(C e^{i\\\\omega T}\\\\), which would have been the result without the transformation. The constants \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\) introduce shifts and scaling that alter the trajectory.",
