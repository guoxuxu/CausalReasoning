  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions describing trajectories in the complex plane. The evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is affected by a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\), defined as \\\\( L(z) = az + b\\\\overline{z} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants, and \\\\( \\\\overline{z} \\\\) denotes the complex conjugate of \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nIf the operator \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and the system evolves under the operator \\\\( L \\\\) without any further interventions, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be solely dependent on the initial application of \\\\( L \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since no further interventions modify the trajectory, and given the deterministic application of the operator \\\\( L \\\\), the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at any later time T is entirely governed by the initial conditions and the continuous evolution dictated by \\\\( L \\\\). The process is linear and deterministic.",
