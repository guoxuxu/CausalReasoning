  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\mathcal{L}u\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) is a function of both space and time, and \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) is a linear differential operator. We explore the effect of applying a Fourier transform, denoted by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), on the system and querying causality with and without intervention.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(T, k)\\\\) in the Fourier domain, can one infer whether the Fourier filter \\\\(\\\\mathcal{G}\\\\) was applied at \\\\(t_1\\\\), if we know there was possibly an intervention but not its specific nature?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the potential similarities in spectral characteristics induced by different possible interventions in the Fourier domain, it is impossible to definitively conclude the nature (type or absence) of the intervention strictly from observing the final state \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(T, k)\\\\). Multiple causal paths might yield the same or similar final transformed states.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "u(t, x) → \\tilde{u}(T, k); \\mathcal{F} → \\tilde{u}(T, k); \\mathcal{G} → \\tilde{u}(T, k); \\mathcal{L} → u(t, x)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function u(t, x) evolves over time according to the operator L. Applying the Fourier transform F converts u(t, x) to its frequency domain representation tilde{u}(T, k). The filter G can modify tilde{u}(T, k) before it is transformed back to the spatial domain."
