  "Problem": "Consider a system where the heat distribution \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) in a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), with \\\\( k \\\\) being the thermal diffusivity constant. We explore how the Fourier transformation \\\\( F(u) \\\\) at time \\\\( t \\\\) and its modification by a function \\\\( g(x, t) = e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) is a constant, affect the system.\n\nAssuming the intervention \\\\( g(x, t) \\\\) is applied at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the Fourier transformed state \\\\( F(u) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be solely dependent on the original heat equation parameters and independent of \\\\( \\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( g(x, t) = e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\) acts as a damping factor, influencing the heat distribution and thus the Fourier transform results. The intervention changes the system’s state post-\\\\( t_1 \\\\), making \\\\( F(u) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) dependent not only on the heat equation but also significantly on \\\\( \\alpha \\\\).",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of the Fourier transform F(u) over time is influenced by the heat equation parameters but is modified by the function g(x, t) which introduces a time-dependent decay factor e^(-αt). After applying g(x, t) at time t1, F(u) at time T (T > t1) incorporates this decay effect from t1 to T."
