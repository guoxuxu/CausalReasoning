  "Problem": "Consider the transform \\\\( z = f(x) = \\\\int_0^x e^{t^2} dt \\\\), which maps the input x to a complex domain. We analyze how the function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) impacts the causality and the influence of various interventions represented by other transforms such as \\\\( g(x) = \\\\int_0^x \\\\sin(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( x_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(x) = \\\\int_0^x \\\\sin(t) dt \\\\) is applied to the already transformed output of \\\\( f(x) \\\\), will the eventual outcome at \\\\( x = T \\\\) (with \\\\( T > x_1 \\\\)) depend solely on \\\\( g(x) \\\\), and not the initial impact of \\\\( f(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention using \\\\( g(x) \\\\) would not erase or independently overwrite the influences brought about by \\\\( f(x) \\\\). Since both transformations cumulatively contribute to the resultant, the outcome at \\\\( x = T \\\\) is influenced by both \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and \\\\( g(x) \\\\). This layered effect ensures dependency on both functions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial transformation by f(x) influences the starting point for g(x), and the subsequent transformation by g(x) affects the value of z' at x = T, which in turn is influenced by the initial transformation through f(x)."
