  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a linear transformation over complex functions, where the input function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed via a convolution with a kernel \\\\( K(t) \\\\), resulting in output \\\\( y(t) = (K * z)(t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty K(t-\\\\tau)z(\\\\tau)d\\\\tau \\\\). The impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to both the kernel and the input function is considered.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is applied initially to both \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( K(t) \\\\), and then the system operates without further processing, will the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) be identical to direct convolution in the time domain?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform to both the kernel and the input does not change the outcome of the convolution, since the convolution theorem states that the Fourier transform of the convolution of two functions is the product of their individual Fourier transforms. The transformation and subsequent inverse transformation preserve the convolution relationship.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Fourier transform to both the input function z(t) and the kernel K(t) results in transforming the convolution operation in the time domain to a multiplication operation in the frequency domain, yielding Y(f) which represents the output in the frequency domain."
