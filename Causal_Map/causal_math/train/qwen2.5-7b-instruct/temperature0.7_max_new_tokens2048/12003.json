  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) governed by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az + B \\\\), where A and B are complex constants. We explore the role of the Laplace transform \\\\( L(z)(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) which transforms this function into the s-domain, affecting the evolution of z.\n\nGiven the transformed domain output observing \\\\( L(z)(s) \\\\) at some point \\\\( s = s_1 \\\\) and knowing the time-domain value \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we conclusively determine whether and what kind of transformations (like Laplace or Fourier) were applied throughout the time evolution from 0 to T?",
  "Explanation": "The observed output in the transformed domain or at time-domain point does not uniquely dictate the application of a specific transformation or its nature due to potential overlap in the effects of different transformations and their possible inverse or complementary applications. The complex nature of transformations like Laplace and Fourier and their reversible properties prevent unique inference of interventions just by endpoint observation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The derivative of z with respect to time is caused by A and B. The function z in the time domain transforms to L(z) in the s-domain via the Laplace transform. Knowing L(z) at s_1 and z(T) allows us to infer the transformations applied during the time evolution."
