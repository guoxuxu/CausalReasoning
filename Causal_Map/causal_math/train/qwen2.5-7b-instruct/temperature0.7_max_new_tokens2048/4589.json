  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t, governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. Analyze the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{C\\\\tau}z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 = u_0 + iv_0 \\\\) at t=0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be altered by the transformation at t=T?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\\\( F(z) \\\\) integrates the state over time, effectively changing the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). This modified initial state influences how the solutions evolve under their respective differential equations, leading to a different state at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial conditions u_0 and v_0 directly cause the values of u(t) and v(t) respectively, which in turn directly cause z(t). The constant matrix C directly causes the integral transformation F(z), which then directly influences z(t) through its evolution governed by the differential equations."
