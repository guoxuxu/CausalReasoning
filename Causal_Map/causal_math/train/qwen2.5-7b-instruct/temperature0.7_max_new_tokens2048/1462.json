  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Mx\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. The effect of an external input characterized by the matrix function \\\\( u(t) = e^{Nt}x \\\\) is analyzed, where N is another constant matrix.\n\nIs it possible to uniquely reconstruct the initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 from the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T knowing only the matrix M and not N?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of N, and knowing only the transformation caused by M, it cannot be guaranteed to uniquely backtrack to \\\\( x_0 \\\\) since the initial condition could have been transformed by any arbitrary instance of N which modifies the subsequent evolution under M.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial vector x_0 directly influences x(t) through the differential equation. M directly influences x(t) by governing its rate of change. u(t) indirectly influences x(t) through its impact on the state over time."
