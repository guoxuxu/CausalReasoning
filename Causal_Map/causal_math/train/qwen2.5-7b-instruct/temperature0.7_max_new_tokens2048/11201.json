  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation of a vector space given by the matrix \\\\( P \\\\) which projects vectors onto a subspace. We explore the effects of applying another linear transformation \\\\( Q \\\\), which is a rotation matrix, on this vector space.\n\nIf a vector \\\\( v \\\\) is first projected via \\\\( P \\\\) and then rotated by \\\\( Q \\\\) at time t = 0, without further transformations, will the resultant vector at time T be the same as applying \\\\( Q \\\\) to \\\\( v \\\\) at t = 0 and then projecting?",
  "Explanation": "Projection and rotation generally do not commute. The operation order alters the resultant vector since \\\\( PQ(v) \\\\) is not the same as \\\\( QP(v) \\\\). The first operation projects then rotates, whereas the second rotates then projects, leading to different final vectors.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
