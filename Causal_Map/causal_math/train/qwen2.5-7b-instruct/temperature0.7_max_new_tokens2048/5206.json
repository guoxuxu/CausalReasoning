  "Problem": "Imagine a system involving heat transfer on a rod modelled by the partial differential equation \\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\), where \\( u \\) represents the temperature, \\( t \\) is the time, and \\( x \\) the position along the rod. The transformation \\( v(x, t) = u(x, t) + h(t)e^{ax} \\) is considered, where \\( h(t) \\) is a specific heat source function and \\( a \\) is a constant.\n\nCan we determine the initial profile \\( u_0 \\) accurately after observing \\( v(x, t) \\) at t = T without knowing whether the transformation \\( v(x, t) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the transformation \\( v(x, t) \\) involving \\( h(t)e^{ax} \\) was applied, it is impossible to accurately trace back to the original profile \\( u_0 \\) as \\( h(t)e^{ax} \\) may have significantly altered the state's evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The temperature change over time (u_t) and the second spatial derivative of temperature (u_xx) directly influence the transformed temperature (v(x, t)). The heat source function (h(t)) and the constant (a) also directly cause changes in the transformed temperature (v(x, t)). The original temperature (u(x, t)), time (t), and position (x) are components that define the transformed temperature (v(x, t))."
