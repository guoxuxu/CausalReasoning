  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( x \\\\) is a constant vector in complex space. This function is used to transform an initial vector in a complex vector space. We investigate the influence of applying an additional transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) at a time t, where \\\\( D \\\\) is also a constant matrix.\n\nHaving observed the final state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to precisely deduce the initial conditions and interventions (specific values or effects of \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( D \\\\), or the times at which they were applied)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complexities introduced by the interactions between the transformations \\\\( e^{iAt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\), and without exact timestamps or parameters of these transformations, it's infeasible to uniquely reverse engineer the sequence of events or parameters leading to the observed outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Multiple combinations of \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( D \\\\), and their application timings might result in the same final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "A transforms the initial vector x over time to produce z(t), which then evolves further under D's influence to become z(T); g(z) directly influences z(T) based on the time t."
