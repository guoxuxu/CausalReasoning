  "Problem": "Consider the equation governing the heat conduction in a rod described by the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) is the temperature distribution, \\\\( t \\\\) is time, and \\\\( x \\\\) is the spatial variable. Assume the rod is initially at rest with a temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,0) = h(x) \\\\) and that k is a constant.\n\nGiven the temperature distribution at some time T, \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the initial temperature distribution \\\\( h(x) \\\\) without knowing any other information?",
  "Explanation": "Using the properties of the heat equation and assuming the diffusive nature of heat, the initial temperature distribution \\\\( h(x) \\\\) can be uniquely reconstructed by applying the inverse of the heat kernel to \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\). This assumptions presuppose the equation is well-posed and the heat kernel can be appropriately inverted.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial temperature distribution u(x,0) determines the temperature distribution at time T u(x,T); the thermal diffusivity k influences both the rate of change of temperature with respect to time u_t and the second spatial derivative of temperature u_xx."
