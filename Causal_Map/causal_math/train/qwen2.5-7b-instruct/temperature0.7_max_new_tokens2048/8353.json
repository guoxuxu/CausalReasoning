  "Problem": "We analyze a mechanical system where the position \\( x(t) \\) of a mass evolves according to the differential equation \\( \\ddot{x} = -kx \\), a simple harmonic oscillator, where \\( k \\) is a positive constant. We introduce transformations via \\( f(x) = A \\sin(Bx) \\) at different instances to investigate causal influences.\n\nIf \\( f(x) \\) is applied to the initial position \\( x_0 \\) at t = 0, and the system is then allowed to evolve under the harmonic oscillator equation without further interactions, will \\( x(t) \\) at t = T differ from the evolution of \\( x_0 \\) directly under the differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( f(x) \\) to \\( x_0 \\) changes the initial condition to \\( A \\sin(Bx_0) \\). This alteration significantly impacts the trajectory of the system due to the nonlinear transformation of the initial state, leading to a different evolution from the standard harmonic oscillator trajectory.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
