  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) subject to the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{it}z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) denotes the imaginary unit. This function operates in a space undergoing changes described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az \\\\), with A being a complex constant.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), is it possible to determine the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) without knowing whether transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied or not?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{it}z \\\\) could influence the initial state, the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) may significantly change depending on whether or not the transformation was applied. Without this information, retrieving the exact initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) merely from the observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is unfeasible.",
