  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario involving integral transformations. Let \\\\( f(z) \\\\) be a holomorphic function in a region \\\\( R \\\\). We examine the effect of transforming \\\\( f(z) \\\\) with an integral operator \\\\( T \\\\), defined by \\\\( T[f](z) = \\\\int_C K(z, s) f(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a contour in \\\\( R \\\\) and \\\\( K(z, s) \\\\) is a kernel function also holomorphic in some domain of \\\\( R \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( T \\\\) is applied to \\\\( f(z) \\\\) to transform it into \\\\( g(z) = T[f](z) \\\\), and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is then allowed to evolve under further holomorphic mappings without intervention, will the resulting function retain properties (e.g., zeros, poles) originally in \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( T \\\\) potentially alters the essential properties of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) by integrating with the kernel \\\\( K(z, s) \\\\). This operation can add or remove zeros or poles or change the function's behavior in its domain depending on the nature of \\\\( K \\\\) and the path \\\\( C \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation of f(z) by the integral operator T with kernel K(z, s) over contour C results in g(z), and further holomorphic mappings preserve the properties of f(z) such as zeros and poles."
