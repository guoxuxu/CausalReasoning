  "Problem": "Consider a complex dynamical system where the evolution of a complex variable \\\\( z \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Cz \\\\), where C is a complex constant matrix. We are interested in how the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) impacts the behavior of \\\\( z \\\\) over time, where D is another complex constant matrix.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Et}z \\\\) (where E is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the subsequent behavior of the system solely depend on matrix C?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the new transformation through \\\\( h(z) \\\\) further complicates the system dynamics, making the resulting state dependent on E as well as C. The effects of D and E create compounded transformation effects, influencing the final state of the system.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation g(z) influences z through the matrix D, while the transformation h(z) influences z through the matrix E. The rate of change of z, dz/dt, is determined by the matrix C. At time t1, applying h(z) introduces an additional influence on z through the matrix E, which affects the system's behavior."
