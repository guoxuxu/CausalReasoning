  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = i \\\\Delta u + k u \\\\) where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) is a complex-valued function, \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) is the Laplacian operator, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf an initial condition \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) is applied and the system evolves according to its dynamics without further intervention, will the system's state at a later time \\\\( t = T \\\\) be affected solely by the properties of \\\\( k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the evolution is significantly influenced by the constant \\\\( k \\\\), it is also inherently dependent on the Laplacian operator which affects the diffusion characteristics of the function. Therefore, the state at time \\\\( T \\\\) is dependent not only on \\\\( k \\\\) but also on the spatial distribution and second derivatives through \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "u_0(x) → u(x,T); k → u(x,T); Δ → u(x,T)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u_0(x) and the properties of k directly cause the system's state u(x,T), while the Laplacian operator Δ also influences u(x,T) through the dynamics described by the partial differential equation."
