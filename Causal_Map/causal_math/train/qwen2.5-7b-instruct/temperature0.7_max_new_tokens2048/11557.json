  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(w) = e^{i\\omega t} w \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. The system under study is defined by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\dot{w} = -iw \\\\). We analyze the effect of the transformation on the system evolution.\n\nIf \\\\( z(w) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( w_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\dot{w} = -iw \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( w(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( w_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\dot{w} = -iw \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( z(w) \\\\) changes the initial condition \\\\( w_0 \\\\) to \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} w_0 \\\\). The system's evolution is thus influenced by the new initial condition, which includes the modulation by the factor \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\). This affects the state trajectory differently than if the evolution started from \\\\( w_0 \\\\) directly.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation z(w0) at t=0 and evolving w under the differential equation results in the same w(t) as directly evolving w0 to t=T under the differential equation."
