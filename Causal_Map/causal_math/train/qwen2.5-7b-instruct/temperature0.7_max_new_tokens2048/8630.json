  "Problem": "Consider a system where a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) maps complex numbers to other complex numbers, defined by \\\\( z(x) = e^{iAx} \\\\) for a real matrix A. The evolution of the function is then impacted by an operator \\\\( L \\\\) known from integral transforms, specifically \\\\( L(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-s^2} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nKnowing the result of the integral transform \\\\( L(z)(x) \\\\), can we infer the original complex input \\\\( x_0 \\\\), assuming no prior knowledge on the matrix A?",
  "Explanation": "The operator \\\\( L \\\\) performs an integration that combines the effects over an infinite range, significantly obfuscating individual contributions from specific inputs like \\\\( x_0 \\\\). Additionally, without information about A, which affects how inputs are transformed, the original input \\\\( x_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined from the resulting integral.",
