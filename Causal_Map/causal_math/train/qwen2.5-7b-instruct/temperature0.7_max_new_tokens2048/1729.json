  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We study how an integral transformation by the operator \\\\( T(v) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Mt}v dt \\\\), where M is a constant matrix, affects the function \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( T(v) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( v_0(x) \\\\) at t = 0 and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at T = t be the same as if \\\\( v_0(x) \\\\) was evolved to T under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( T(v) \\\\) initially modifies the function's state by integrating it with respect to time under the transformation \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\). This change in initial conditions will generally result in a different evolution under the operator L, leading to a distinct state at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the integral transformation T(v) to v_0(x) at t=0 and then evolving under ∂u/∂t = Lu is equivalent to evolving v_0(x) directly under ∂u/∂t = Lu for the same time interval."
