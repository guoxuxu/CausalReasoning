  "Problem": "Consider a time-dependent wave function \\\\( \\\\psi(x,t) \\\\) governed by the Schrödinger equation \\\\( i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial t} = H\\\\psi \\\\), where \\\\( H \\\\) is the Hamiltonian operator. Let's analyze the effect of an external operator \\\\( U(t) = e^{-iBt} \\\\), where B is a constant operator, applied as a transformation on the wave function.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( \\\\psi(x,T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( U(t) \\\\), \\\\( V(t) \\\\), or both), solely by knowing the value of \\\\( \\\\psi(x,T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( \\\\psi(x,T) \\\\) might be achieved through different sequences of applying \\\\( U(t) \\\\) and \\\\( V(t) \\\\), as well as varying properties of B and C. Given the non-commutative properties and potentially overlapping effects of the transformations, it is impossible to uniquely backtrack and identify the exact interventions applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of either U(t) or V(t) or both transformations can lead to a specific endpoint ψ(x,T), but knowing only ψ(x,T) does not uniquely determine which interventions were used."
