  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant angular frequency. This function describes a circle in the complex plane over time. We investigate the impacts of applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = ze^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant, at different times.\n\nBy observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at the endpoint, can we determine precisely what interventions (either \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were applied, if we only know the final value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from various combinations of transformations applied at different times or possibly none at all. The multiplication by exponential terms with complex exponents makes it particularly challenging to disentangle and uniquely identify which transformations were applied when or if they were applied, due to the overlapping effects on the magnitude and phase.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
