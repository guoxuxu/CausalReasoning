  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\), which is a Laplace transform of the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Assume \\\\( z(t) \\\\) satisfies the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\) where M is a constant matrix. Let an intervention be defined as a multiplication by matrix \\\\( P \\\\) at time t = 0.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is simply allowed to evolve according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\) without any intervention, will the resulting transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) be consistent over different initial conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome of the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) depends on the matrix M and the initial condition. Different initial states will lead to different evolutions under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), and thus, the Laplace transform of these trajectories will also differ.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
