  "Problem": "Consider the relationship governed by the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\), representing the unit circle in the complex plane. Study the behavior of the system when a transformation \\( f(z) = z^2 \\) is applied.\n\nAfter observing \\( z(t) \\) at t = T under \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\), can we determine if \\( f(z) \\) was applied at t = 0 to transform the original point?",
  "Explanation": "Observing \\( z(t) \\) at t = T without prior knowledge of the application of \\( f(z) \\) doesn't provide enough information to conclusively tell if the initial point was squared, as the same point \\( e^{iT} \\) could result from different initial conditions in the domain of \\( f(z) \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
