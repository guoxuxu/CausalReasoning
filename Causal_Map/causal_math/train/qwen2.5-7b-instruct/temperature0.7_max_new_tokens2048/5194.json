  "Problem": "Consider a vector-valued function z(t) defined in a complex domain and governed by the differential equation \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\), where M is a 2x2 matrix. An integral transformation \\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{Mt} z(t) \\, dt \\) is applied. The transformation is modified by a complex function \\( f(z) = e^{i\\omega t} z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real number.\n\nBased on the outcome of \\( T(z)(T) \\), can we infer the original vector \\( z_0 \\) and whether \\( f(z) \\) was applied, without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The action of \\( f(z) \\), by modifying the initial conditions through complex exponentiation, obscures the original state \\( z_0 \\) and the precise nature of its phase shift. Without knowing the application of \\( f(z) \\), the original state cannot be uniquely determined from \\( T(z)(T) \\) alone.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The matrix M directly causes the derivative of z with respect to time (M → dz/dt), z(t) directly causes the transformation T(z) (z(t) → T(z)), and z(t) directly causes the application of the function f(z) (z(t) → f(z)). The real number ω directly causes the function f(z) (ω → f(z))."
