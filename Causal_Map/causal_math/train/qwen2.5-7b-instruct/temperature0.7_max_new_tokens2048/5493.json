  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Schrödinger equation for a quantum particle in a potential V(x), described by \\\\( i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial t} = [-\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m}\\\\nabla^2 + V(x)]\\\\psi \\\\). We explore the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the wave function \\\\( \\\\psi(x, t) \\\\) at time t and analyzing its momentum space representation.\n\nIf a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( \\\\psi(x, 0) \\\\) at t = 0, and then the wave function is allowed to evolve according to the Schrödinger equation without further intervention, will \\\\( \\\\psi(p, T) \\\\) in momentum space at t = T be the same as if \\\\( \\\\psi(x, 0) \\\\) was evolved to t = T and then transformed?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) at t = 0 and evolving in position space yields a different trajectory due to the potential term V(x) affecting the phase differently in position space before transforming, compared to evolving in momentum space directly where the kinetic and potential energy contributions evolve differently.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The potential V(x) influences the wave function ψ(x, t) over time, and the initial wave function ψ(x, 0) determines both the evolved wave function ψ(x, t) at any time t and its Fourier transform ψ(p, T) in momentum space at time T. Applying a Fourier transform to ψ(x, 0) at t=0 and then evolving it according to the Schrödinger equation yields the same result as evolving ψ(x, 0) to t=T and then transforming it."
