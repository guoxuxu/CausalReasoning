  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), known as the wave equation. We explore the influence of a Fourier transform applied initially (\\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u(x,0))\\\\)) and how it impacts the propagation of the wave over time.\n\nIf an additional transformation, let's say a Laplace transform (\\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(u)\\\\)), is applied at a later time t_1, will the system's state at time T > t_1 solely depend on the original wave equation without considering the effects of the Fourier or Laplace transforms?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a Laplace transformation as an intervention modifies the system's evolving state further by altering its spectrum in complex plane, and thus the state at any later time T will depend on the interplay between the Fourier transform, the Laplace transform, and the inherent dynamics prescribed by the wave equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u(x,0) and its Fourier transform F(u(x,0)) directly cause the state u(x,t) at any time t. Applying a Laplace transform L(u) at a later time t_1 does not directly influence the state u(x,t) for T > t_1 according to the wave equation."
