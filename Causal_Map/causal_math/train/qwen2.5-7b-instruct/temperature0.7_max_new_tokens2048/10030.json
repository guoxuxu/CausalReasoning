  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) applied to a complex plane transformation, and the integral transformation \\\\( I(z) = \\\\int_0^T z(t) dt \\\\). Evaluate the causal relationships regarding the modulation of the parameter \\\\( w \\\\) and the effect on the integral \\\\( I(z) \\\\).\n\nKnowing that \\\\( I(z) = 0 \\\\), can we infer a precise value of \\\\( w \\\\) from \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) without any modifications?",
  "Explanation": "The result \\\\( I(z) = 0 \\\\) can occur for any value of \\\\( w \\\\) as long as \\\\( T \\\\) matches a multiple of the function's period (effects of \\\\( 2\\\\pi \\\\)). Hence, \\\\( w \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined from the integral alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
