  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iz\\\\), and an integral transformation \\\\(T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{s^2} z(s) ds\\\\). We investigate how the results of further transformations and initial conditions evolve through the system.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), a new operation \\\\(G(z) = \\\\int_0^{t_1} e^{-s} z(s) ds\\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the system's state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend exclusively on the natural evolution under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iz\\\\) and not on \\\\(T\\\\) or \\\\(G\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\(G(z)\\\\) introduces an additional modification, impacting the system's trajectory alongside the initial transformation \\\\(T(z)\\\\). Both the nature of \\\\(T\\\\) and \\\\(G\\\\) transformations, which incorporate integral manipulations with distinctive kernel functions (exponential growth and decay respectively), contribute to the final state at \\\\(z(T)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state of z at time t influences both T(z) and G(z). G(z) does not directly cause changes in T(z); they are both derived from the evolution of z."
