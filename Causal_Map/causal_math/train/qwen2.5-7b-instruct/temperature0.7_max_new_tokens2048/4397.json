  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, obeying the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz \\\\). We study the influence of a transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\), where k is a real constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition of the trajectory. Since \\\\( e^{kt} \\\\) scales the magnitude of the initial condition, this results in a trajectory that spirals outward more rapidly compared to the unmodified differential equation. The state at time T, therefore, is not the same as it would have been without the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation g(z) applied to z_0 at t=0 and then evolving according to dz/dt = iz for time t results in z(t) being equivalent to directly evolving z_0 to time T under dz/dt = iz, given that k and T are appropriately related."
