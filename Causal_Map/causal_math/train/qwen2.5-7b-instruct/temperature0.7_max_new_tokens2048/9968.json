  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = e^{iwx} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We assess the effect of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on this function, given by the integral \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z)(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{iwx} e^{-ikx} dx \\\\), analyzing both the direct transformation and its inversion.\n\nKnowing only the transformed result \\\\( 2\\\\pi \\\\delta(k - (w + q)) \\\\), can we accurately trace back and distinguish whether the original function was transformed or phase-shifted?",
  "Explanation": "The final Fourier transform result of a shifted delta function does not specify whether the shift was due to an original different frequency in \\\\( z(x) \\\\) or a subsequent phase-shift operation. Both scenarios yield indistinguishable transformations in this setup, demonstrating an inability to differentiate past operations based solely on the final transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The value of w directly influences the form of z(x) and F(z)(k); the value of q directly influences F(z)(k); knowing F(z)(k) allows us to infer details about both w and q, but does not uniquely determine z(x) without additional information."
