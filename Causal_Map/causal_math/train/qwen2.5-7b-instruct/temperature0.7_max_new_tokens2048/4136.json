  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(x, t) = e^{tx}i\\\\), where \\\\(x\\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\(t\\\\) is a real parameter, evolving over time according to the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = az\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the end state \\\\(z(x, T)\\\\), can we precisely determine which intervention (change from \\\\(a\\\\) to \\\\(b\\\\), or both) was implemented solely based on the information of \\\\(z(x, T)\\\\) without additional context?",
  "Explanation": "The end state \\\\(z(x, T)\\\\) potentially results from different interventions or combinations thereof. Without extra context on the timing and nature of the intervention (i.e., change in differential equation's parameter from \\\\(a\\\\) to \\\\(b\\\\)), and given that both affect the exponential growth differently, it's not feasible to accurately trace back and specify which interventions exactly were used and when.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
