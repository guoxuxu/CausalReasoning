  "Problem": "Let's examine the interplay between two complex functions, \\\\( z(t) = e^{iωt} \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) = e^{-iωt} \\\\), in the context of a complex plane traversal. The complex exponentials represent rotation dynamics in the complex plane, with \\\\( ω \\\\) being a real constant.\n\nIf an intervention switches the system from \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( w(t) \\\\) at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be solely determined by the initial evolution under \\\\( z(t) \\\\) up to \\\\( t_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention introduces a new dynamic; the system's path is affected by both the initial evolution under \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and the subsequent evolution under \\\\( w(t) \\\\). The result is a complex combination of the effects due to both functions, making the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on the dynamics of both.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
