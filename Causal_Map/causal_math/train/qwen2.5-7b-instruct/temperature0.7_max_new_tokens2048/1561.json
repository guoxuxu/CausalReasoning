  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit consisting of resistors, inductors, and capacitors governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2v}{dt^2} + \\\\alpha \\\\frac{dv}{dt} + \\\\beta v = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) are constants. We explore the influence of an input signal transformation defined by \\\\( g(v) = e^{st}v \\\\) where s is a complex constant, investigating its effect over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( g(v) \\\\) is applied to an initial voltage \\\\( v_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the original differential equation without further modification, will \\\\( v(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( v_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the unaltered equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(v) \\\\) modifies the initial condition of the system, altering its trajectory. The transformation \\\\( e^{st} \\\\) affects the temporal dynamics by introducing an exponential decay or growth factor depending on the real part of s, influencing the circuit's behavior divergently from the untransformed scenario.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation g(v) = e^(st)v to the initial voltage v_0 at t=0 influences v(t) over time; the constants α and β determine how v(t) evolves; the passage of time t affects v(t); the initial voltage v_0 directly sets the starting point for v(t)."
