  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number. This function is a solution to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\). We analyze the impact of altering \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) through an applied transformation \\\\( g(t, z) = e^{i\\\\beta t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is another real number.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether the frequency was altered or \\\\( g(t, z) \\\\) was applied or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the transformations affect the final state additively through their exponentials in frequency, the same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can potentially result from different combinations of frequency changes and applications of \\\\( g(t, z) \\\\). Thus, it is impossible to uniquely identify the interventions based only on the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
