  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant. An integral transformation \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int e^{Bt}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another complex constant, is applied.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( F(z(T)) \\\\), can we ascertain exactly what modifications (original transformation \\\\( F \\\\), differential modification \\\\( Cz \\\\), or both) were performed, solely based on the outcome at T?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the integrated and compounded nature of the transformations (both initial transformation \\\\( F \\\\) and differential intervention \\\\( Cz \\\\)), multiple combinations of \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) can potentially lead to similar or indistinguishable outcomes at \\\\( F(z(T)) \\\\). This overlap makes it impossible to uniquely determine the specific interventions applied throughout the interval solely based on the endpoint result.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z(t) directly influences its derivative dz/dt through the differential equation. The value of z(t) at time T directly influences the result of the integral transformation F(z(T)). The constant A directly causes the form of dz/dt. The constant B directly causes the form of the integral transformation F(z(T))."
