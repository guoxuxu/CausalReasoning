  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature \\( T \\) across a rod varies over time and can be described by the heat equation \\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2} \\) where \\( k \\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. An external heat source modifies the initial temperature distribution as \\( f(T) = T_0 + h \\\\sin(\\\\omega x) \\) where \\( T_0 \\) is the initial uniform temperature, \\( h \\) is the amplitude, and \\( \\\\omega \\) the frequency of the heat variation.\n\nKnowing the final temperature \\( T(x, T) \\) and assuming interventions might have occurred, can we uniquely determine the specific interventions used (whether \\( f(T) \\), \\( g(T) \\), or both), based solely on the observation at \\( t = T \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the diffusive property of the heat equation and potential overlapping effects of the interventions, it is impossible to precisely separate and identify the impacts of different interventions solely by observing the final state. Multiple different combinations of parameters and interventions could lead to similar temperature distributions at \\( t = T \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
