  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The transformation by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{at}z \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant, is studied.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the resultant is evolved under the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, will the value of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any time t be the same as if no initial transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the initial value by a scale factor of \\\\( e^{a0} = 1 \\\\), thus initially no change, but as t increases, \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) introduces a time-varying scaling that alters the magnitude and potentially the phase of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), depending on the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( a \\\\). Moreover, the transformation affects how \\\\( z \\\\) evolves under the differential equation, leading to a trajectory that deviates from the untransformed case.",
