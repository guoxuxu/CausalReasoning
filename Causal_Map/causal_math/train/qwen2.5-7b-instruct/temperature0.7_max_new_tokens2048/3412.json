  "Problem": "Analyze the causal inference of a system represented by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = U(t)z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( U(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) is a unitary operator in the complex plane and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. This system is disturbed by applying a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{A\\tau}z \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant real-valued matrix and \\\\( \\tau \\\\) is time of application.\n\nKnowing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at the endpoint, can we precisely infer the nature of interventions (whether \\\\( f(z), g(z) \\\\), or both) based on the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple configurations of A and B can lead to identical or indistinguishable endpoints due to the nature of exponential transformations in the complex plane, especially when compounded by the uniform rotating effect of \\\\( U(t) \\\\). This results in an inability to conclusively determine what transformations were applied along the path from the observed endpoint.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "U(t) → z(t); A → f(z); τ → f(z); z_0 → z(t); ω → U(t); z(t) → z(T)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state z_0, through the evolution operator U(t) parameterized by ω and time t, influences the state z(t). The transformation f(z) parameterized by A and time τ further modifies z(t) to produce the final state z(T)."
