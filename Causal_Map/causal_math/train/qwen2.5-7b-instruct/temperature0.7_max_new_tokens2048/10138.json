  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit that involves a resistor (R) and an inductor (L) in series connected to an alternating current (AC) voltage source. The relationship between the current (I) and the voltage (V) across the circuit can be modeled using a differential equation \\\\( V - L\\\\frac{dI}{dt} - RI = 0 \\\\). We are also interested in the impact of a Laplace Transform on this differential equation.\n\nCan we determine the exact original voltage waveform V(t) by observing the current I(t) at all times t > 0 without knowing the initial conditions of I?",
  "Explanation": "Since the voltage could include a transient component that does not leave a traceable impact in the steady-state current, and due to potential initial inductor currents affecting early timesteps uniquely, falling outside observable impacts, the exact initial V(t) cannot always be determined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
