  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The system is initially governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are real constants. A transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) is introduced where C is a complex constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is another complex constant) is applied as an intervention, and then the system evolves to time T > t_1, does the final state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend solely on the original constants A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\), applied at time t_1, introduces a new dynamic to both components of \\\\( z \\\\) through the complex exponential factor \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\). Thus, the final state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is a result of the combined effects of A, B, C, and D, not just A and B.",
