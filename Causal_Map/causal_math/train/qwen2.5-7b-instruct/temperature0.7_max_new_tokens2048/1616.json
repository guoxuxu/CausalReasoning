  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + a(x) \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( a(x) \\\\) is a spatially varying coefficient. The impact of the initial transformation by Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}[u(x,0)](s) \\\\) is studied over time t.\n\nGiven the endpoint u(x,T), can we precisely determine what transformations were used (whether \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), or both), solely based on the knowledge of u(x,T)?",
  "Explanation": "Since both the Laplace and Fourier transforms can significantly alter the properties and representation of the function u, the final state u(x,T) might not uniquely determine the transformations applied earlier. Multiple sequences of transformations could potentially yield similar or identical final states under the given differential equation, especially without additional information on how these transforms were implemented (i.e., parameters or specific conditions used during transformations).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u(x,0) directly influences u(x,T) through the evolution described by the PDE. The coefficient a(x) also directly influences u(x,t). The Laplace transform of the initial condition u(x,0) leads to u(x,T)."
