  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We explore the effect of an integral transformation given by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant and T is a finite upper limit.\n\nCan one accurately determine the original function components \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( e^{i\\\\gamma t} \\\\) solely from knowing the transformed result \\\\( F(z')(T) \\\\) when both frequencies \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) were present?",
  "Explanation": "Given the overlapping effects of different frequency components in the integral transformation, and without distinct separability in the frequency domain within the given integral boundaries, it is impossible to precisely discern contributions from \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( e^{i\\\\gamma t} \\\\) in the transformed output.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The original function z(t) is influenced by the angular frequency ω and the phase frequency γ. The integral transformation F(z)(T) depends on the original function z(t) and the complex constant s. Knowing F(z')(T) alone does not allow for accurate determination of z(t) and e^(iγt) when both ω and γ are present."
