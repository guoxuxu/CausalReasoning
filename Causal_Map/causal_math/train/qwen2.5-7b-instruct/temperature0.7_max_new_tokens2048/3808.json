  "Problem": "Given a linear operator \\\\(L\\\\) acting on a function space, and the transformation defined by \\\\(T(f)(x) = f(x)e^{-x^2}\\\\), we consider the system's behavior when applying various operators or transformations simultaneously.\n\nGiven the endpoint function after the applications of \\\\(T(f)(x)\\\\), \\\\(U(f)(x)\\\\), and \\\\(L\\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations or operators were applied, based solely on the form of the output function?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint function's form can result from various combinations and sequences of transformations and operators. Separating out and accurately determining each change from \\\\(T\\\\), \\\\(U\\\\), and \\\\(L\\\\) based solely on the endpoint is not feasible without additional information on the precise interventions and their sequences.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
