  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\), where C is a complex constant. Analyze the impact of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) over time t, where D is also a complex constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ft}z \\\\) (where F is a complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on C and not on D or F?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces another layer of complexity, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on D, F, as well as C. The transformations \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Ft} \\\\) affect the system's trajectory and the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) through its compositional effects.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
