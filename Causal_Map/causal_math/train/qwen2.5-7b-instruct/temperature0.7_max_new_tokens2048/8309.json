  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( w(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) and subsequently transformed by a function \\\\( h(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\), where \\\\(z\\\\) is a complex variable. We explore the behavior of this system under various transformations and interventions.\n\nIf the function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and the resulting \\\\( w(z) \\\\) evolves without other influences, will the final state \\\\( w(z(T)) \\\\) at some time T be independent of the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition by transforming \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( e^{z_0^2} \\\\). Since \\\\( w(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) is sensitive to the input argument, this altered starting point changes the evolution path, impacting the resultant state at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation h(z) directly affects w(z) through z, and thus the final state w(z(T)) at time T is dependent on the transformation h(z)."
