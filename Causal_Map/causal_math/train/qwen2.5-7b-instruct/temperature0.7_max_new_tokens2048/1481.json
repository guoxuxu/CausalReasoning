  "Problem": "Investigate a complex function scenario, where the complex function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is defined by a Fourier transform of another function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), specifically \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} g(t) e^{-izt} dt \\\\). We examine the implications of changing the original function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) to \\\\( g(t) + \\\\delta(t) \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\) represents a delta function.\n\nIf the modification of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) by adding \\\\( \\\\delta(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and then taking the Fourier transform, will \\\\( h(z) \\\\) yield the same result as if no modification was made?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of \\\\( \\\\delta(t) \\\\) fundamentally changes \\\\( g(t) \\\\), and since the Fourier transform of \\\\( \\\\delta(t) \\\\) is 1, the new transform \\\\( h(z) \\\\) will differ by a constant of 1 across all z compared to the original transform, thus altering the output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The addition of δ(t) to g(t) at t=0 changes h(z) because the Fourier transform of δ(t) is 1, thus altering the integral."
