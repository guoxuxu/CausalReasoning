  "Problem": "Consider the complex function defined as \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\). Investigate the effects of a transformation by matrix \\( M \\) where \\( M \\) effects the amplitude and frequency. The transformed variable is \\( w(t) = M z(t) \\). Let's analyze using variable separation and integral transformations.\n\nIf \\( w(t) = M z(t) \\) is calculated at t = 0 and time-evolved following the original function definition \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), will the trajectory of \\( w(t) \\) for t > 0 be a scaled version of \\( z(t) \\) without further alteration?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation by \\( M \\) does not merely scale but may also rotate and distort the frequency component due to matrix multiplication altering the phase and amplitude, thus changing the fundamental trajectory from a simple scaled version of \\( z(t) \\).",
