  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the function \\\\( z(x) = Kx \\\\), where K is a complex constant matrix. An integral transformation \\\\( I(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{1} e^{tz} dt \\\\) is applied, which modifies subsystem behaviors dynamically.\n\nIf \\\\( z(x) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without further intervention, and the integral transformation \\\\( I(z) \\\\) is carried out, will the transformed outcome \\\\( I(z(x_0)) \\\\) be the same as applying the integral transformation directly on \\\\( x_0 \\\\) under multiplication by K?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation through \\\\( z(x) = Kx \\\\) shapes the initial vector within a complex linear transformation, modifying trajectories prior to the application of the integral transformation. The integral transformation then acts on this transformed vector, leading to outcomes that reflect compounded effects of both K and the operational limits of the integral.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z(x) determines I(z); applying z to x_0 yields z(x_0); integrating I(z(x_0)) transforms x_0 through the matrix K; directly applying I on x_0 without z would yield a different result."
