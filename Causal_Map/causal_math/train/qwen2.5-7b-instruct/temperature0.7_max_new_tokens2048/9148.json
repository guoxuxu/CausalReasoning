  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the integral equation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} K(t,s) x(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( K(t,s) \\\\) is a given kernel function and \\\\( x(s) \\\\) is the input function. Analyze the behavior when applying a transformation \\\\( g(x) = x + h(t) \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is another function.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( y(T) \\\\) and knowing interventions occurred, can we precisely identify the specific transformations applied (original \\\\( g(x) \\\\), the intervention \\\\( x(s) + j(s) \\\\), or both) just by analyzing the final output?",
  "Explanation": "Even with the knowledge of interventions, the final output \\\\( y(T) \\\\) alone does not permit a clear dissection of the specific transformations applied due to the integral interaction between the kernel and various inputs. The compounded effect of initial and subsequent transformations obscures the individual effects, making precise identification challenging.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input function x(s) directly influences the output y(t) through the kernel K(t,s). The function h(t) indirectly affects y(t) by altering x(s). Similarly, the function j(s) also indirectly affects y(t) by modifying x(s)."
