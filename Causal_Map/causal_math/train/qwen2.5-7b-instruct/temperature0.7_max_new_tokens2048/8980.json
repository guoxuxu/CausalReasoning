  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations modulated by a stochastic process defined as \\\\( dX_t = AX_t dt + dB_t \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( B_t \\\\) is a Brownian motion. We are interested in the behavior of \\\\( X_t \\\\) under the transformation \\\\( f(X) = e^{Ct}X \\\\) for a constant matrix \\\\( C \\\\), and the integral transform \\\\( F(X_t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-(t-s)A}X_s ds \\\\).\n\nHaving observed the state \\\\( F(X_T) \\\\) at time T and knowing the transformation \\\\( g(X) = e^{Dt}X \\\\) took place, can we identify whether the transformation \\\\( f(X) \\\\) was also applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The stochastic nature of \\\\( B_t \\\\) and the overlapping effects of matrix exponentials applied at different times make it challenging to disentangle the influence of \\\\( f(X) \\\\) from just the observation of \\\\( F(X_T) \\\\). Multiple combinations of initial conditions and interventions could lead to the same observed outcomes.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The state F(X_T) determines X_T, which then determines X_0. The transformation g(X) transforms X into X_T, and the transformation f(X) transforms X_0."
