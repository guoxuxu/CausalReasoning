  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation system driven by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We explore the role of an operator transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = Dz \\\\), where D is a diagonal matrix with complex entries.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention through a function \\\\( k(z) = Pz \\\\) where \\\\( P \\\\) is a permutation matrix, is applied, does the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( M \\\\) and not on \\\\( D \\\\) or \\\\( P \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( k(z) \\\\) disrupts the system’s normal progression by rearranging vector components, which influences its trajectory in conjunction with the initial alteration by \\\\( D \\\\). Hence, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on the original matrix transformations \\\\( D \\\\), \\\\( P \\\\), and \\\\( M \\\\), not solely on \\\\( M \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
