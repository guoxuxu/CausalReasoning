  "Problem": "Consider a closed curve C in the complex plane and a function f(z) which is holomorphic inside and on C, except for isolated singularities inside C. We examine the effect of applying the contour integral transformation \\\\( g(f) = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi i} \\\\int_C f(z) dz \\\\) which computes the residues of the function at its singularities.\n\nIf another function transformation h(f) which modifies f(z) is applied inside C before g(f), will the result of g(f) still solely reflect the original residues of f(z)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying a transformation h(f) may alter the nature and existence of singularities of f(z) within C, potentially introducing new singularities or eliminating existing ones. Therefore, the resultant g(f) is likely to differ, as it now represents the residues sum of the modified function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying a modification to f(z) via h(f) before computing g(f) can alter the result of g(f) because g(f) depends on the residues of f(z) at its singularities."
