  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\). The function \\\\( f(t) = t^n \\\\) undergoes a transformation involving the Fourier integral representation by applying the transform \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s^{n+1}} e^{as} \\\\), where 'a' is a constant.\n\nGiven a transformed function \\\\( F(s) \\\\), can we deduce the exact form and parameters of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) without knowing whether a scaling transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about potential initial scaling (the constant \\\\( k \\\\)), we cannot uniquely reverse-engineer \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to its original form at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\). The scaling alters the amplitude of the time function, which is directly reflected in the transform, making it impossible to infer the exact original \\\\( f(t) \\\\) just from \\\\( F(s) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Fourier integral representation F(s) of the function f(t) = t^n is inversely related to s^(n+1), and the constant 'a' influences F(s). Knowing F(s) allows deducing the form and parameters of f(t) except for the value at t=0 without information on scaling."
