  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\) and transformations are applied as \\\\( f(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions (\\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were used, only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The complex number at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from various combinations or sequences of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or even from none if \\\\( k \\\\) and \\\\( h \\\\) are suitably chosen. Due to the properties of complex exponentials and their capacity to achieve similar effects through different parameters, it is indeterminate.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
