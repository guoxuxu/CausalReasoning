  "Problem": "Investigate a unitary transformation system defined by \\\\(z(t+1) = Uz(t)\\\\) where \\\\(U\\\\) is a unitary matrix and \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is a complex vector. Consider the impact of the transformation \\\\(g(z) = Vz\\\\), where \\\\(V\\\\) is another unitary matrix.\n\nIf \\\\(g(z)\\\\) is applied to a complex vector \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0, and the system is then left to evolve under \\\\(z(t+1) = Uz(t)\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\(z_0\\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(z(t+1) = Uz(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(g(z)\\\\) changes the initial state through the application of \\\\(V\\\\). Due to the properties of unitary matrices, the final state will reflect the initial transformation \\\\(V\\\\). The interplay between \\\\(V\\\\) and \\\\(U\\\\) dictates a different trajectory depending on the specific matrices used, leading to a distinct state at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation g(z) to z(0) and then evolving under z(t+1) = Uz(t) for T steps results in the same z(T) as directly evolving z(0) under z(t+1) = Uz(t) for T steps."
