  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution across a rod is modeled by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) denotes the temperature, and \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. We explore the impact of an initial heat function \\\\( f(x) = e^{-x^2} \\\\) applied along the rod.\n\nIf at a specific moment \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a cooling effect described by a function \\\\( g(x,t) = e^{-xt} \\\\) is introduced along the rod, will the final temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of the initial condition and follow only the new intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The final state at \\\\( T \\\\) depends on both the initial condition set by \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and the intermediate intervention by \\\\( g(x,t) \\\\). The cumulative effect of the initial heat distribution and the cooling function will determine the final temperature profile.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial heat function f(x) influences the temperature distribution u(x,t) initially. The introduction of a cooling effect g(x,t) at time t_1 influences the temperature distribution u(x,t) subsequently, leading to a change in u(x,t) beyond t_1."
