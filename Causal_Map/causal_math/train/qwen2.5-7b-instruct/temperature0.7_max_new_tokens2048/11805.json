  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\) where \\\\( f(x, y) = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 \\\\). We study the effect of transformations \\\\( g(x, y) = (x + 1, y + 1) \\\\) and their inverse on the function, along with an external forcive change in variable using the transformation \\\\( h(x, y) = (2x, 3y) \\\\).\n\nGiven the calculation of \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\) after applying the transformation \\\\( g(x, y) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the original point \\\\( (x_0, y_0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining \\\\( (x_0, y_0) \\\\) solely from the output of \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\) after the transformation is applied requires solving a quadratic equation, which typically has more than one solution, thus making it ambiguous.",

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation g(x, y) = (x + 1, y + 1) to a point (x, y) results in a new function value f(x + 1, y + 1), but this transformation does not allow us to uniquely determine the original point (x, y) from f(x + 1, y + 1) alone. Similarly, applying the transformation h(x, y) = (2x, 3y) changes the input values, which also does not enable unique determination of the original point based solely on the transformed function output."
