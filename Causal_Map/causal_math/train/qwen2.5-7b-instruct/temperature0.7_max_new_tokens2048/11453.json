  "Problem": "Consider a function system described by the complex function \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a complex constant. This system undergoes an integral transformation defined by \\\\( I(w) = \\\\int w(z) dz \\\\) applied over a certain path in the complex plane.\n\nIf the function \\\\( w(z) \\\\) is computed and then transformed by \\\\( I(w) \\\\) without any additional functions applied to it, will the integral transformation result at any contour path being the same as the integral of \\\\( e^{Az} \\\\) directly over that path?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( I(w) \\\\) of the function \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) calculated directly over any given path in the complex plane will indeed result in the same value as directly integrating \\\\( e^{Az} \\\\) over the same path, since no modifications or external functions alter this direct relationship.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of w(z) depends on the complex constant A, and the integral transformation I(w) of w(z) results in the integral of e^(Az) over the specified path in the complex plane."
