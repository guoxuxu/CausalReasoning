  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation given by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a Hermitian matrix and \\\\( x_0 \\\\) is a fixed complex vector. The transformation evolves a quantum state in time t in a closed system.\n\nUpon observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, is it possible to conclusively determine whether the intervention \\\\( e^{iH't} \\\\) was applied, solely based on the final state and knowledge of \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( H' \\\\), and T?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple different perturbative actions could lead to the same final state due to the properties of the exponential operators and the potential overlap in their resulting spaces. Even if exact times of application and types of interventions are known, the precise influence and nature of intermediate dynamics might be indistinguishable at T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z(T) depends on A and T; applying H' influences the evolution through e^(iH't), which in turn affects z(T)."
