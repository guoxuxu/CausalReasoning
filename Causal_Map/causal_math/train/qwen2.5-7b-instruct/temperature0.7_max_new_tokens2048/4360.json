  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that evolves according to the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}z = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We investigate the influence of the Fourier transformation \\\\( F(z) \\\\) defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega, T) \\\\) at some endpoint \\\\( T \\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations were applied (whether \\\\( z(t) \\\\to z(-t) \\\\) or no transformation), based strictly on the observed value of \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega, T) \\\\) can manifest similar characteristics for either direct evolution or an intervention like \\\\( z(t) \\\\to z(-t) \\\\), particularly when the base function is symmetric or when frequency components overlap. This ambiguity prevents unique determination of prior interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The function z(t) changes over time due to the partial differential equation, undergoes Fourier transformation to produce hat{z}(ω, T), and this transformation allows us to observe its frequency domain representation."
