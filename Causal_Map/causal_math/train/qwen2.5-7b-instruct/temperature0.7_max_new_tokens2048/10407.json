  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant. To analyze the behavior, we intervene by applying a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}\\\\cdot z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is also a constant, at a certain time.\n\nIf a secondary transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{-i\\\\phi}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention at any time \\\\( t_2 \\\\) > 0, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), for T > t_2, depend solely on the original system dynamics and not on \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the second transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) as an intervention further shifts the phase of the system. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on both the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), as well as the phase alterations introduced by \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\), thus not solely depending on the original dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z(t) is influenced by ω through the differential equation, and is transformed by f(z) and g(z). The final state z(T) for T > t2 depends on the initial conditions and the system dynamics defined by ω, but not on θ and φ after the transformations are applied."
