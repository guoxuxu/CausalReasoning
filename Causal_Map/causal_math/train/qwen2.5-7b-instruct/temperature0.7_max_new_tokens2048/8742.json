  "Problem": "Evaluate the effects of a Fourier transform on a causal system described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = -Ax + u(t) \\\\), where A is a constant scalar and u(t) is an external input. Assume \\\\( U(s) \\\\) is the Laplace transform of u(t) and consider the impact of transforming the initial conditions via a convolution with another function \\\\( h(t) \\\\).\n\nCan we accurately deduce the original input function u(t) by Fourier transforming the output x(t) of the system and analyzing it without knowing the specific dynamics of the system?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the system parameter A and how it influences the transmission and attenuation of frequencies, it is not possible to uniquely reconstruct u(t) from the Fourier-transformed output \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\), especially due to potential loss of information regarding phase and magnitude modifications.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "u(t) → x(t); A → dx/dt; x(t) → X(s); h(t) → Y(t); U(s) → Y(s); X(s) * Y(s) → Z(s)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input function u(t) directly influences the system state x(t). The constant A directly affects the rate of change of x(t). The Laplace transform of x(t) is X(s), while the Laplace transform of u(t) is U(s). The convolution of X(s) and Y(s) results in Z(s)."
