  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear transformation \\\\( L: \\\\mathbb{C}^n \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C}^n \\\\), defined by the matrix \\\\( M \\\\). An external operation \\\\( T(t) = e^{Nt} \\\\) with \\\\( N \\\\) being another constant matrix, acts on the state space over time. The impact of this operation on the initial conditions and subsequent system behavior is studied.\n\nWith knowledge of the final state at t = T, can we precisely determine the interventions applied (whether \\\\( T(t) \\\\), \\\\( U(s) \\\\), or both) during the process?",
  "Explanation": "The same final state \\\\( y(T) \\\\) might arise from different sequences of interventions due to the non-unique effects of matrix exponential operations and the potential superposition of their effects. Without additional information, the precise sequence and type of interventions cannot logically be inferred from the end state alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
