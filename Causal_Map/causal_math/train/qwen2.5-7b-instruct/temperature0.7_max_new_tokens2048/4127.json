  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz + N \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) are complex constants. We investigate how the transformation by the complex exponential function \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) impacts the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nSuppose an intervention is made at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by applying a function \\\\( g(z) = e^{-i\\\\omega t}z \\\\). Will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), where \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\), be independent of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), relying solely on M and N?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces an additional complex exponential factor that influences the future trajectory and final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\), making it dependent on the values of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), as well as \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\). The interaction between both exponential transformations (from \\\\( f \\\\) and \\\\( g \\\\)) alters the overall system dynamics and the resulting state.",
