  "Problem": "Consider the process of solving an integral transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number. In this context, assume that \\\\( f(t) = e^{At} \\\\), with A being a real constant. Further assume that the Laplace transform is uniquely invertible.\n\nDoes changing A directly influence the result of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} \\\\), assuming no external change to the transformation parameter s?",
  "Explanation": "Changing A directly affects \\\\( f(t) \\\\) which is \\\\( e^{At} \\\\), leading to a different form of the function being transformed. Since the Laplace transform is sensitive to variations in the function f(t), a change in A modifies the resulting transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
