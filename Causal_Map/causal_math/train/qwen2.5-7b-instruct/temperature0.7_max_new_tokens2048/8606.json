  "Problem": "Consider a quantum system where the state vector \\\\( \\\\psi(t) \\\\) evolves according to the Schrödinger equation \\\\( i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{d\\\\psi}{dt} = H\\\\psi \\\\), where H is the Hamiltonian of the system. We examine changes due to the operation of the unitary transformation \\\\( U(t) = e^{-iH't} \\\\), where \\\\( H' \\\\) is another Hamiltonian.\n\nCan we deduce the original state vector \\\\( \\\\psi_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( \\\\psi(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( U(t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( U(t) \\\\), multiple initial states could potentially evolve to the same observed state under their respective Hamiltonians. The presence of \\\\( U(t) \\\\) with a distinct \\\\( H' \\\\) adds an ambiguity, as it alters the evolution path and resultant state vector at any time t.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the unitary transformation U(t) influences the state vector ψ(t) at time t. The initial state vector ψ(0) determines ψ(t), and U(t) is determined by H'. The Hamiltonian H governs the evolution of ψ(t)."
