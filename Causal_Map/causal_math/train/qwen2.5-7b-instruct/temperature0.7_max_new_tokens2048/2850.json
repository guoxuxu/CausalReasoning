  "Problem": "Consider a complex system where the temperature distribution in a rod is given by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\), representing the heat equation with diffusion coefficient k. To study the influence of surface coatings, a transformation represented by \\\\(u(x,0) = e^{-ax^2}\\\\) is applied at the initial time, where a is a constant.\n\nGiven the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) at time T, can we infer the exact initial condition \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\), specifically whether the transformation \\\\(e^{-ax^2}\\\\) was applied, without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing only the temperature distribution at a later time T does not uniquely determine whether the initial condition was transformed by \\\\(e^{-ax^2}\\\\). The heat equation's diffusive nature tends to smooth out initial conditions, making it difficult to recover precise details about the temperature profile at t = 0.",
