  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) that evolves over time according to the differential equation \\\\( \\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix. We analyze the potential effects of an integral transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(z) = \\int_0^t e^{St}z(s) ds \\\\), where S is another constant complex matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) starting from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and evolved under \\\\( \\dot{z} = Mz \\\\) without further intervention, will the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to the scenario where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\dot{z} = Mz \\\\) without applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) can drastically alter the trajectory by incorporating the integrated effect of the complex exponential term \\\\( e^{St} \\\\) into the dynamics of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). This fundamentally shifts the state of the function from what would have occurred solely under \\\\( \\dot{z} = Mz \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state z_0 directly causes the state z(T) at time T through the differential equation Mz. The integral transformation h(z) does not directly cause a change in z(t) if no further intervention occurs, but it modifies z(t) by integrating its past states weighted by e^(St). Without further intervention, z(T) resulting from applying h(z) to z_0 is not necessarily equivalent to evolving z_0 directly under Mz to time T."
