  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We analyze the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\omega, t)\\\\) initially and after an intervention defined by multiplying by a modifier function \\\\(m(\\\\omega)\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, 0) \\\\) is obtained by applying the Fourier transform to \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, T)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the same PDE?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is a linear and invertible operation, preserving the dynamics under linear differential operators. Thus, transforming the initial condition and evolving or evolving the initial condition and then transforming will yield consistent results.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "u(x, 0) → u(x, T); u(x, 0) → hat{u}(ω, 0); hat{u}(ω, 0) → hat{u}(ω, T); m(ω) → hat{u}(ω, T)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Fourier transform to the initial condition u(x, 0) results in hat{u}(ω, 0), which evolves to hat{u}(ω, T) under the PDE. Multiplying by the modifier function m(ω) before evolving also leads to hat{u}(ω, T). Without the modifier, the evolution of u(x, 0) to u(x, T) corresponds to hat{u}(ω, T) through the Fourier transform."
