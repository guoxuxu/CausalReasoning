  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on complex numbers \\\\( z \\\\) as \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z^t dt \\\\), where s is a complex parameter. The focus is on understanding the behavior of the inverse Laplace transform evaluated over different time intervals t and interpreting the effect of parameter s.\n\nIf an additional exponential damping \\\\( e^{-\\gamma t} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\gamma \\\\) is a positive constant) is introduced as an intervention at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will this always result in a lower value of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at any \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) compared to no intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing \\\\( e^{-\\gamma t} \\\\) adds an additional decay factor to the existing e^{-st}, compounding the damping effect and leading to an invariably lower magnitude of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) post-intervention, due to the integration over a faster-decaying function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
