  "Problem": "Consider a complex function represented by \\\\( z = u(x,y) + iv(x,y) \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) and \\\\( v \\\\) are real-valued functions of real variables \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\). We are studying the changes induced by the Laplace transformation \\\\( L \\\\) on the function, defined as \\\\( L[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to \\\\( u(x,y) \\\\) to transform it into \\\\( L[u](s) \\\\), then subsequently to \\\\( v(x,y) \\\\) to form \\\\( L[v](s) \\\\), can we consider \\\\( L[z](s) = L[u](s) + i L[v](s) \\\\) as the valid Laplace transform of \\\\( z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the Laplace transformation to \\\\( u \\\\) and \\\\( v \\\\) independently and then combining them adheres to the linearity property of the Laplace transform, where the transform of a sum equals the sum of the transforms when the functions involved satisfy the necessary conditions for transformation.",
