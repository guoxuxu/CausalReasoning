  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( u_t = Lu \\\\) where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. We review the effect of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) = \\\\hat{u} \\\\), and how it translates to solve the equation in the transformed domain.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system evolves under \\\\( u_t = Lu \\\\) without further intervention, will the result \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( u_t = Lu \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is a reversible, linear operation that changes the basis from the time to the frequency domain. Solving the equation in the frequency domain and translating it back gives the same result as solving it directly in the time domain, since the operations are equivalent under the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u(x, 0) directly influences u(x, t) through the evolution governed by u_t = Lu. Applying the Fourier transform to u(x, 0) results in hat{u}, which also directly influences u(x, t). Therefore, the effect of evolving u(x, 0) directly or via its Fourier transform hat{u} to time t=T under the same differential operator L should be equivalent."
