  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(w) \\\\) which maps complex numbers under the transformation \\\\(z(w) = e^{iw}\\\\). We study its effects on waves modeled by the integral transformation \\\\(x(t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\pi}^{\\\\pi} z(w)e^{iwt} dw\\\\).\n\nGiven the waveform at time T, is it possible to determine what transformations were specifically applied (either \\\\(z(w)\\\\), \\\\(y(w)\\\\), or both) to the original wave function?",
  "Explanation": "Depending on the nature of the transformations and the overlap between their effects, various combinations of \\\\(z(w)\\\\) and \\\\(y(w)\\\\) might yield similar or indistinguishable outcomes at time T. Without additional constraints or data, the specific transformations cannot be uniquely identified because their effects on phase and amplitude are intertwined.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
