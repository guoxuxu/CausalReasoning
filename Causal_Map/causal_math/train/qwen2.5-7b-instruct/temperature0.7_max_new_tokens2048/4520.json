  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) defined on the complex plane, where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t. The function is subjected to a Fourier transform, resulting in \\\\( \\hat{z}(\\omega) \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the frequency domain variable.\n\nKnowing the modified Fourier transform \\\\( \\hat{z}(\\omega) \\\\) after an intervention, can we determine precisely what function was applied to z(t) without other data?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform results from complex overlapping of frequency components due to the intervention along with original components. Without additional data, isolated identification of the intervention function based solely on the transform is indeterminate, due to potential multiple solutions fitting the same frequency modifications.",
