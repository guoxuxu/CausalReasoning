  "Problem": "Examine the complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\) where \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) are solutions to the coupled differential equations \\( \\dot{x} = Ax + By \\) and \\( \\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\) respectively. Consider the effect of the linear operator \\( L(z) = e^{Mt}z \\) where M is a constant matrix, applied at different intervals.\n\nCan we determine the initial complex number \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0 after observing \\( z(T) \\) at T without knowing whether \\( L(z) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the existence or non-existence of the \\( L(z) \\) application, the possible alteration by the transformation \\( e^{Mt} \\) introduces uncertainty in back-calculating the original \\( z_0 \\). The alteration could have changed the dynamic system states in a non-recoverable way.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial complex number z_0 at t = 0 influences z(T) through the evolution described by the differential equations and the linear operator L(z), and observing z(T) can help determine z_0 if L(z) was not applied."
