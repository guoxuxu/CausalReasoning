  "Problem": "Consider a magnetic field \\\\( \\\\vec{B} = B_0 e^{-kt} \\\\hat{z} \\\\), acting on a charged particle resulting in the Lorentz force equation \\\\( \\\\dot{\\\\vec{v}} = q (\\\\vec{v} \\\\times \\\\vec{B}) \\\\). We explore the effects of an applied electric field \\\\( \\\\vec{E} = E_0 \\\\hat{x} \\\\) as a transformation on the particle's motion.\n\nGiven the endpoint trajectory of the particle at \\\\( T \\\\), can we determine precisely what fields were applied (whether \\\\( \\\\vec{E} \\\\), \\\\( \\\\vec{B} \\\\), or \\\\( \\\\vec{B}_1 \\\\)), only by knowing the final state of the particle?",
  "Explanation": "The multiple influences exerted by electric and magnetic fields, with their respective direction and decaying factors, create overlapping and entangled effects that obscure the specific contributions of each. This complexity, including potentially similar effects from different field configurations, hinders exact backward inference of applied fields.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial magnetic field strength B_0, the electric field strength E_0, the time t, and the additional magnetic field B_1 each influence the velocity v of the particle."
