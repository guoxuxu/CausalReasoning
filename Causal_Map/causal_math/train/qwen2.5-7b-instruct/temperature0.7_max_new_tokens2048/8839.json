  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a real constant. We analyze the effects of an integral transformation \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{-i\\\\omega s}z(s) ds \\\\) on the solution.\n\nAssuming an intervention using a new integral transformation \\\\( U[z](t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{i\\\\omega s}z(s) ds \\\\) is applied at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\) depend only on the original differential equation and not on the transformations \\\\( T \\\\) or \\\\( U \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( U[z] \\\\) applies yet another transformation with distinct properties, impacting both the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) post-\\\\( t_1 \\\\) and the eventual state at \\\\( T \\\\). The result at \\\\( T \\\\) therefore reflects the combined influences of the original differential equation, \\\\( T[z] \\\\), and \\\\( U[z] \\\\), creating a dependency beyond just the original equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z(t) is influenced by ω through the differential equation dz/dt = iωz, and it is also affected by the integral transformations T[z](t) and U[z](t). However, the value of z(T) for t1 < T depends solely on the original differential equation and not on the transformations T or U."
