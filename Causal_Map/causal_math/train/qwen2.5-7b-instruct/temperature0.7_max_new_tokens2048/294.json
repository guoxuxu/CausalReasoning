  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We analyze the impact when this function undergoes a Fourier transform over time t.\n\nGiven the Fourier transform result as a Dirac delta function at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), can we infer that the original function was \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of a Dirac delta function at a specific frequency in the Fourier transform unequivocally suggests that the original function was a complex exponential at that frequency. This unique mapping from frequency domain to time-domain signal characterizes the complex exponential.",
