  "Problem": "Consider the eigenvalue problem in complex function theory, defined by the equation \\\\(Ax = \\\\lambda x\\\\), where A is a linear operator on a complex vector space, and \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) are the eigenvalues. We examine the effect of an integral transformation \\\\(T(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At}x dt\\\\) on the eigenvalues.\n\nCan we infer the initial operator A just by analyzing the eigenvalues of the system after transformation \\\\(T(x)\\\\), without knowing the specifics of the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The eigenvalues derived from the transformed system under \\\\(T(x)\\\\) are a result of both the integral transformation and the original nature of A. Without clear knowledge of the transformation specifics, particularly \\\\(e^{At}\\\\)'s integration, it is practically infeasible to disentangle A's contribution accurately.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
