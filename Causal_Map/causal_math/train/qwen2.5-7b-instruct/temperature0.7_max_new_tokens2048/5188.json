  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), which evolves according to the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Pz\\\\), where P is a constant matrix. We explore the behavior of the function under the influence of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) over time t, where Q is also a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we exactly determine what interventions were applied (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), solely by observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identical endpoints \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can result from differing sequences of interventions due to the complex, non-commutative interactions between matrix exponentials. The transformations \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Rt} \\\\) create overlapping potential states, obscuring the original interventions employed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z at time T (z(T)) is influenced by the initial value of z (z(0)), the rate of change of z (P), the transformation applied (g(z)), and the time elapsed (t). The transformation g(z) itself depends on the matrix Q."
