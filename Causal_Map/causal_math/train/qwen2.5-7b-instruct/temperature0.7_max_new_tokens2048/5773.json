  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix. We evaluate the effects of the integral transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = \\int_0^t e^{At}z(\\tau)d\\tau \\\\), where A is also a constant complex matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) initially modifies the trajectory by integrating the effect of \\\\( e^{At}z(t) \\\\), thereby altering the evolution path from the outset. The introduction of \\\\( A \\\\) influences the entire subsequent evolution distinct from the control by \\\\( M \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the integral transformation h(z_0) results in z(t), which then evolves according to Mz = dz/dt; directly evolving z_0(t) according to Mz = dz/dt also leads to z(t) at time t=T."
