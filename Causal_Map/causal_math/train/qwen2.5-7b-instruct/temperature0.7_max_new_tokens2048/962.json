  "Problem": "Consider a system described by a Laplace transform \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{y(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), where \\\\( y(t) \\\\) represents a temporal signal transformed into the complex frequency domain by \\\\( s \\\\). We explore the effects of multiplying \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) by a transfer function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-p} \\\\), where \\\\( p \\\\) is a pole.\n\nCan you deduce the original signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\) from \\\\( y'(t) \\\\) after observing its transformation by \\\\( H(s) \\\\) into the Laplace domain without knowing \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the details of \\\\( H(s) \\\\), particularly the pole \\\\( p \\\\), the modifications induced such as damping or amplification at specific frequencies are unknown, making it impossible to accurately reconstruct \\\\( y(t) \\\\) from \\\\( y'(t) \\\\) without additional information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The transfer function H(s) transforms Y(s) into Y'(s), which then transforms back into y'(t) through the inverse Laplace transform. The original signal y(t) is related to Y(s) through the Laplace transform."
