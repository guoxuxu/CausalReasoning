  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant, often represented as \\\\( a = b + ci \\\\). We examine how the function responds to the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), and we analyze situations both with and without interventions defined by multiplying by another function \\\\( h(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = \\\\frac{1}{s - b - ci} \\\\), can we uniquely determine the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), specifically identifying both \\\\( b \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform clearly encodes both the real and imaginary components of \\\\( a \\\\) in its denominator. This allows for the exact reconstruction of \\\\( z(t) = e^{(b+ci)t} \\\\) by identifying \\\\( b \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\) from the transform function.",
