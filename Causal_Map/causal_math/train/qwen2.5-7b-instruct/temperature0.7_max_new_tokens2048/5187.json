  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), which evolves according to the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Pz\\\\), where P is a constant matrix. We explore the behavior of the function under the influence of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) over time t, where Q is also a constant matrix.\n\nWith an additional intervention at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) where another function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\) (R being another constant matrix) is applied, does the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend exclusively on P, or also on Q and R?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces additional dynamics to the system, with transformation \\\\( e^{Rt} \\\\). The final state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) thus depends not only on P but also on how both Q and R have influenced the trajectory throughout T, altering both growth and direction.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The endpoint z(T) depends on P through its evolution according to the differential equation, and also on both Q and R due to the interventions applied at time t_1."
