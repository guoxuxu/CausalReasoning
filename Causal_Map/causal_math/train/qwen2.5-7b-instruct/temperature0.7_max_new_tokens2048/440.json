  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Hx\\\\), where H is a constant matrix. The effect of a linear transformation \\\\( g(x) = Dx \\\\), where D is a diagonal matrix, is investigated.\n\nKnowing the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( g(x) \\\\), \\\\( f(x) \\\\), or both), merely by analyzing the value of \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact interventions from the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is complex due to the potential for different transformations \\\\( D \\\\) and \\\\( S \\\\) to produce similar or identically appearing endpoints, especially without explicit knowledge of the intervention times and types. This uncertainty arises from the non-trivial interactions between the transformations and system dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
