  "Problem": "Consider a stochastic process governed by the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a differential operator. We are interested in the behavior under the transformation \\\\( G(u) = \\\\int e^{-tx} u(x) \\\\, dx \\\\), which integrates along the spatial variable x with a decay term dependent on time t.\n\nSuppose an intervention is applied by another transformation \\\\( H(u) = \\\\int e^{kt} u(x) \\\\, dx \\\\) at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the solution \\\\( u(T, x) \\\\) at time T > t_1 be influenced only by L and not by \\\\( G \\\\) or \\\\( H \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The system's evolution to time T will be influenced by both transformations \\\\( G \\\\) and \\\\( H \\\\) alongside the differential operator L. The transformations introduce additional factors that modify the function through integrations and exponential terms specific to each transformation, impacting the end result at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
