  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) over time t in the complex plane, and its response under the linear transformation defined by \\\\( L(z) = kz \\\\), where k is a complex constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( L(z) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and then it evolves according to \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if no transformation was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( L(z) \\\\) modifies the initial value of the function from \\\\( z(0) = 1 \\\\) to \\\\( z(0) = k \\\\). As the function evolves, this initial scaling affects all subsequent values, resulting in \\\\( z(T) = ke^{iT} \\\\), which differs from \\\\( e^{iT} \\\\) unless k equals 1.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
