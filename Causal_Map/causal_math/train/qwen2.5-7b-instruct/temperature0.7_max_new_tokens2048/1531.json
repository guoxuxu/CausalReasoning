  "Problem": "Examine a physical system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} = -\\\\lambda u\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) is a constant. The transformation considered is through the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), applied to the initial condition.\n\nIf at time \\\\(t = t_0\\\\) the function undergoes a second transformation, \\\\(\\\\mathcal{G} = \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\circ \\\\mathcal{T} \\\\circ \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\mathcal{T}\\\\) is another transformation, will the end point \\\\(u(T)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_0\\\\) still reflect the effects of only the initial Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention \\\\(\\\\mathcal{G}\\\\) at time \\\\(t_0\\\\) implicitly modifies the dynamics by altering the spectral components or spatial characteristics of the state, leading to a distinct outcome at time \\\\(T\\\\) that depends on both \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\mathcal{T}\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial Fourier transform of the function at time t_0 influences u(T), with subsequent transformations G further modifying u(T) based on the effect of T."
