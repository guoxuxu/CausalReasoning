  "Problem": "Consider a linear control system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx + Nu\\\\), where M and N are constant matrices and u represents a control input. We analyze the behavior of the system under a Laplace transform \\\\( L(x(t)) = X(s) \\\\) to express solutions in terms of complex frequencies.\n\nIf a non-zero control input \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is applied after an initial period of autonomous evolution under \\\\( M \\\\), will the final state in the transformed domain \\\\( X(s) \\\\) be independent of the control matrix N?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by \\\\( u(t) \\\\) introduces effects governed by the matrix N, affecting the solution to the differential equation and consequently altering the Laplace transform \\\\( X(s) \\\\). The presence of N modifies the final expressed output in the frequency domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
