  "Problem": "Consider a vibrating mechanical system that can be mathematically modeled as a differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + 2\\\\zeta\\\\omega\\\\frac{dx}{dt} + \\\\omega^2x = 0\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\zeta\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) are damping ratio and natural frequency respectively. Suppose an external impulse given by the function \\\\(f(t) = \\\\delta(t - t_0)\\\\) (Dirac delta function) applies at time \\\\(t_0\\\\).\n\nBased on the amplitude variations observed at time \\\\(T\\\\), can we precisely determine the timing and type of both impulse and step interventions?",
  "Explanation": "The observed amplitude at time \\\\(T\\\\) could result from various combinations of amplitudes and phases initiated by the impulse and modified by the continuous force. Due to the complexity of interactions between these forces, specifically how the step function modifies the ongoing response initiated by the delta function, precise back-calculation of intervention timings and types from amplitude alone is not feasible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
