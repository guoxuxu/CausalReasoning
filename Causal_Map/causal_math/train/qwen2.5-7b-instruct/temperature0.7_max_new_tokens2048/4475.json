  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in terms of a complex variable \\\\( z \\\\), such that \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where A is a positive real constant. Analyzing the effect of multiplying \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by a complex exponential function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), where B is another real constant. Observations are made over the interval from 0 to T.\n\nIf a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{iCt}z \\\\) is introduced as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and the system evolves to time T, will the final state depend solely on \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( B \\\\) or \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) further affects the trajectory and final state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). As a result, the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is shaped by the combined influence of A, B, and C, specifically transitioning through \\\\( e^{i(AT_1+BT_1)} \\\\) then \\\\( e^{iA(T-t_1)} \\\\) post-intervention. The cumulative effect of both exponential functions leads to a dependency on A, B, and C.",
