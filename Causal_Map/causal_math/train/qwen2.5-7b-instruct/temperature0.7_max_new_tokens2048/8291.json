  "Problem": "Consider a network of resistors in an electrical circuit, where the voltage is governed by the equation \\\\(V = ZI\\\\), with \\\\(Z\\\\) being the impedance matrix, which is a function of the complex frequency \\\\(s\\\\). Now, a Fourier transform of the voltage signal \\\\(V(s)\\\\), noted as \\\\(\\\\hat{V}(s)\\\\), introduces a transformation by the function \\\\(f(V) = e^{st}V\\\\). We evaluate the effects on current \\\\(I\\\\) under different scenarios.\n\nIf an intervention changes the impedance matrix to \\\\(Z'(s)\\\\) at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the final current \\\\(I(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the updated matrix \\\\(Z'\\\\) and not on the initial transformation \\\\(f(V)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention affects the impedance matrix but the total system response is dependent on both the original transformation \\\\(f(V)\\\\) and the newly adapted impedance. The initial state altered by \\\\(f(V)\\\\) sets a different trajectory that interacts with the modified impedance matrix \\\\(Z'\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Changing the impedance matrix Z'(s) directly influences the final current I(T) for T > t_1. The initial transformation f(V) affects the voltage V(s), which in turn influences the current I."
