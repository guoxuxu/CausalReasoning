  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function evolves over time according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix. We investigate the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Nt}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where N is also a constant complex matrix.\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( k(z) = \\\\int_{t_1}^T e^{Qt}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) (where Q is another constant complex matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on M and not on N or Q?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the new integral transformation \\\\( k(z) \\\\) introduces additional dependencies on the matrices N and Q. The ultimate state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be influenced by how these transformations (associated with N and Q) interact with the ongoing dynamics dictated by M, potentially causing a significantly altered endpoint.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
