  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix. The impact of a transformation, defined by \\\\( g(z) = R(t)z \\\\) where \\\\( R(t) = e^{iNt} \\\\) (N being a constant complex matrix) on the complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is studied.\n\nGiven the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we precisely identify which transformations (\\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) were used, only from the knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Detecting the specific transformations used based solely on the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is highly challenging due to the potential multiplicity of transformation paths (via N and Q) and their complex matrix interactions leading to similar end states. This scenario does not allow for a unique identification of the intervention history.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
