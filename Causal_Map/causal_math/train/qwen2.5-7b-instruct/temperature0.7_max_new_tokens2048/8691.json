  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex vector. We analyze the impact of an integral transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-iB\\\\tau}z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) applied at time t, with B also being a constant matrix.\n\nIf a new transformation \\\\( k(z) = e^{iCt}z \\\\) is applied as an intervention at t = T, does the final state at T+Δt depend only on A and not on B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention at t = T with \\\\( k(z) \\\\) further changes the state by applying another matrix exponential, which can interact non-trivially with the effects of A and B. The final state at T+Δt is influenced by all three matrices, A, B, and C, because of the complex interplay between the exponential actions and the integral transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state z_0 directly influences z(t) through A; B influences h(z) through z(τ); applying k(z) at T with C modifies z; the final state at T+Δt depends on A and the intervention C but not on B."
