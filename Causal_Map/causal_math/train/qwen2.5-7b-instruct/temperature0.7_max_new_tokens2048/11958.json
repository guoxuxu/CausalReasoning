  "Problem": "Consider a control system where temperature regulation is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dT}{dt} = -k(T - T_{env}) \\\\), where \\\\( T \\\\) is the temperature, \\\\( T_{env} \\\\) is the environmental temperature, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a positive constant. We study the effect of a sudden shift in \\\\( T_{env} \\\\) modeled by the function \\\\( T_{env}(t) = T_{base} + H(t)S \\\\), where \\\\( H(t) \\\\) is the Heaviside step function, and \\\\( S \\\\) is a constant shift.\n\nIf, after the shift in \\\\( T_{env} \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), a cooling system intervenes to enforce a constant temperature, will the final operational temperature depend only on the settings of the cooling system, regardless of \\\\( S \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by the cooling system overpowers the natural system dynamics and environmental influences. Hence, the final temperature is dependent solely on the cooling system's set temperature, irrespective of \\\\( S \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Environmental temperature (T_env) directly influences the system temperature (T); the cooling system directly influences the system temperature (T); base temperature (T_base) indirectly influences environmental temperature (T_env) through the shift function; constant shift (S) directly influences environmental temperature (T_env)."
