  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output \\\\( z \\\\) is given by the Fourier transform of a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), applied to an input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\). Assume that the Fourier transform pair is represented by \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) for \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) for \\\\( h(t) \\\\), and the resulting output in the frequency domain is \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) = H(\\\\omega) X(\\\\omega) \\\\).\n\nIf the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) is a delta function \\\\( \\\\delta(t) \\\\) and no intervention is applied, will the output \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) be equivalent to \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) without any modifications?",
  "Explanation": "The delta function \\\\( \\\\delta(t) \\\\) has a Fourier transform that is a constant across frequencies. Thus, \\\\( X(\\\\omega) = 1 \\\\) for all \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). The output then naturally becomes \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) = H(\\\\omega) \\\\times 1 = H(\\\\omega) \\\\), which implies that without any modification, the output will just reflect the frequency response of the system defined by \\\\( h(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input signal x(t), specifically when it is a delta function δ(t) at t = 0, directly influences its Fourier transform X(ω). The function h(t) directly influences its Fourier transform H(ω). The product of X(ω) and H(ω) results in the output Z(ω) in the frequency domain."
