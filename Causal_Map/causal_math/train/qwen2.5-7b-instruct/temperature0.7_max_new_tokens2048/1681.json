  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\) with \\\\( \\omega \\\\) a real constant. We examine the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\( F(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-2\\pi ist}z(t) \\, dt \\\\) on this function over the variable s.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is defined for all t and the Fourier transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is computed, will the peak of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) occur at s equal to \\\\( \\omega /(2\\pi) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\) results in a delta function centered at \\\\( s = \\omega / (2\\pi) \\\\), indicating the peak frequency component of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( \\omega /(2\\pi) \\\\). This demonstrates the direct causal relationship from the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to its Fourier transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) without any external intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
