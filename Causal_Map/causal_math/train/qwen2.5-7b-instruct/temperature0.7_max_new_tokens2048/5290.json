  "Problem": "Consider a multi-variable function \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\) where \\\\( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \\\\). An integral transformation using a kernel \\\\( K(u,v;x,y) = e^{-(u^2+v^2)} \\\\) is applied, transforming the function to \\\\( F(u,v) = \\\\int \\\\int e^{-(u^2+v^2)}(x^2 + y^2) dx dy \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( F(u,v) \\\\), can we exactly recover the original form of \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\) without knowing the specific kernel used in the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Recovering \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\) from \\\\( F(u,v) \\\\) without prior knowledge of the kernel \\\\( K(u,v;x,y) \\\\) used is infeasible. The kernel potentially modifies the function in a non-invertible way, particularly in the integration over an infinite domain.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The original function f(x, y) is transformed into F(u, v) via the kernel K(u, v; x, y), and knowing F(u, v) and K(u, v; x, y) allows us to infer f(x, y), but without the specific kernel, exact recovery of f(x, y) from F(u, v) is not guaranteed."
