  "Problem": "We consider the scenario of an electrical circuit with a complex impedance function \\\\(Z(s)\\\\) in the Laplace domain, where \\\\(s\\\\) represents the complex frequency. The causal relationship between voltage input \\\\(V(s)\\\\) and current output \\\\(I(s)\\\\) is given by \\\\(I(s) = \\\\frac{V(s)}{Z(s)}\\\\). We explore the transformations introduced by connecting an additional impedance \\\\(Z_1(s)\\\\) in parallel and series configurations within the circuit.\n\nBy measuring \\\\(I(s)\\\\) at a certain instant, can one infer whether an additional impedance was originally connected in the circuit, assuming there was no other information provided about system alterations?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit information about alterations to the circuit, such as the connection of additional impedances, the observed current \\\\(I(s)\\\\) alone cannot definitively indicate modifications to the original setup. The change must be known a priori to distinguish between modifications and the original state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
