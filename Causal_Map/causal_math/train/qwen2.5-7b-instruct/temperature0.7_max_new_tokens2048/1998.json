  "Problem": "Analyze a hypothetical economic model where output \\\\( Q(t) \\\\) is described by \\\\( Q(t) = Ce^{kt} \\\\), where C is output at t=0, and k is a growth rate constant. The intervention is defined by a policy function \\\\( P(Q) = Qe^{rt} \\\\), with r being a policy-induced growth adjustment factor.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( Q(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine the exact initial output \\\\( Q_0 \\\\) without knowing whether an intervention \\\\( P(Q) \\\\) was applied or not?",
  "Explanation": "Without clear information on whether the intervention was applied, it is not possible to accurately backtrack to \\\\( Q_0 \\\\) as the growth rate could have been altered by r, leading to multiple potential values of \\\\( Q_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial output C directly influences Q(t), the growth rate k also directly influences Q(t), and if the policy function P(Q) is applied, it directly influences Q(t). Q(t) at time T is determined by C, k, and the application of P(Q)."
