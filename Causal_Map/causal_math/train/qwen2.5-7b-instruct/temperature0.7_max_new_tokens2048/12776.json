  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\), where \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\) evolve over time governed by a system of coupled linear differential equations. The system is represented by \\(\\dot{z} = Mz\\), where \\(M\\) is a constant matrix. We examine the influence of the Laplace transformation \\( \\mathcal{L}(z)(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\) on causal inference between \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\).\n\nIf \\( \\mathcal{L}(z)(s) \\) is applied to \\( z(t) \\) initially, and occurred transformation is allowed to evolve under \\( \\dot{z} = Mz \\) without further intervention, will the behavior of \\( x(T) \\) and \\( y(T) \\) at a future time \\(T\\) perfectly match their paths had \\( z(t) \\) been evolved directly under \\( \\dot{z} = Mz \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Laplace transformation alters the functional form of \\(z(t)\\) by integrating it over an exponential decay, which modifies \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\) in a non-trivial manner affecting their evolution under the differential system. The time-domain behavior of \\(x(T)\\) and \\(y(T)\\) therefore diverges from the original path.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of z(t) under the differential equation ∂z/∂t = Mz determines the values of x(t) and y(t). Applying the Laplace transform L(z)(s) to z(t) results in z(s), which can be used to find z(t+T). Without further intervention, the behavior of x(T) and y(T) derived from z(t+T) will match those obtained by evolving z(t) directly under ∂z/∂t = Mz."
