  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution over a plate is described by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = \\\\kappa \\\\nabla^2 u \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) being the thermal diffusivity constant. We explore the impact of an initial transformation using Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi) = \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}^n} e^{-2 \\\\pi i x \\\\cdot \\\\xi} u(x, 0) \\\\, dx \\\\) and study the system evolution.\n\nIf an intervention is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by modifying the thermal diffusivity constant to \\\\( \\\\kappa' \\\\), will the resulting temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of the original diffusivity \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the thermal diffusivity partway through the process introduces a discontinuity in how heat diffuses through the plate. The subsequent temperature distribution relies on the combination of both \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) before and \\\\( \\\\kappa' \\\\) after the intervention, affecting the final outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The thermal diffusivity constant directly influences the temperature change over time. The initial temperature distribution affects the temperature distribution at later times. An intervention changing the thermal diffusivity constant at a specific time directly impacts the temperature distribution thereafter."
