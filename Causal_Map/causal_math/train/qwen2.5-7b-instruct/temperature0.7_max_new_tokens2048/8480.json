  "Problem": "Consider a system functioning under a Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s)\\\\). The system is influenced by another function \\\\(g(t) = \\\\sin(\\\\omega t)\\\\) applied either initially or during the operation, and the impact on the transform's outcome is analyzed.\n\nCan the contributions of \\\\(g(t)\\\\) and \\\\(h(t)\\\\) be distinctly identified from the final transform output observed at time T?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform combines effects from both \\\\(g(t)\\\\) and \\\\(h(t)\\\\) into a singular expression, making it challenging to discern distinctly the individual contributions of \\\\(g(t)\\\\) and \\\\(h(t)\\\\) merely from the final transform output, without additional information about the system's configurations or further decompositional analysis.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
