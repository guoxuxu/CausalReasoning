  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where the variable z evolves according to the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz\\\\), where A is a real constant, and i is the imaginary unit. The transformation is defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{-Bt}z \\\\) over time t, where B is also a real constant.\n\nCan we correctly deduce the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without a definitive knowledge of the application of transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\), recovering \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is undermined by the potential modification introduced by \\\\( e^{-Bt} \\\\). This transformation can complicate backward deductions due to changes in magnitude and phase of the original state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z at time t (z(t)) is influenced by the initial state z_0, the rate of change \\\\(\\\\dot{z}\\\\) which depends on z and the constant A, the exponential decay factor e^{-Bt} which depends on the constant B and time t, and time t which progresses."
