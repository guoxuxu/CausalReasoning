  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( F(z) \\\\) defined on the complex plane and the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) applied to a real function \\\\( g(t) \\\\). We explore the effects of initial conditions and transformations on the behavior of the transformed function over time.\n\nIf an initial real function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is given, and it is transformed by \\\\( L \\\\) without any additional modifications, will the behavior of the resulting function \\\\( F(z) \\\\) exactly represent the transformation of the initial function by \\\\( L \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform linearly maps the function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) to its complex counterpart \\\\( F(z) \\\\). Assuming no additional alterations, the transformation exhibits a direct and clear mapping from the time domain function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) to the Laplace domain function \\\\( F(z) \\\\), representing exactly the effect of initial conditions processed by \\\\( L \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace transform L of a real function g(t) results in a function F(z) that represents the transformation of g(t) in the complex domain."
