  "Problem": "Consider a complex function represented by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z^2 + 1} \\\\), used as a transformation within the context of an integral transformation defined by the operator \\\\( T \\\\) where \\\\( T[g](s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}g(t) dt \\\\). The system investigates how transformations affect the Laplace transform of the function over the variable s.\n\nCan the original function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) be exactly identified from \\\\( T[g](s) \\\\) at s = 2 without knowing initial transformations and alterations?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform \\\\( T[g](s) \\\\) encapsulates the function in a transformed state that generally obscures some characteristics of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), such as zero locations or multiplicity unless specific integral properties of the original function are known.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace transform T[g](s) of the function g(z) at s = 2 causally influences the identification of the original function g(z), but this identification is not possible without knowledge of the initial transformations and alterations."
