  "Problem": "Consider a smooth manifold M in \\\\(\\\\mathbb{R}^n\\\\) equipped with a vector field \\\\(X(p)\\\\). Analyze the implications of applying an integral transformation \\\\(T(p) = \\\\int f(p) dp\\\\) on the manifold, where \\\\(f(p)\\\\) is a smooth function.\n\nGiven the flow lines on M at a later time and assuming no knowledge whether the transformation \\\\(T(p)\\\\) was applied, is it possible to uniquely identify the original point \\\\(p_0\\\\) from which the manifold evolved?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\(T(p)\\\\), and considering that \\\\(f(p)\\\\) might alter flow properties uniquely across different points, the original point \\\\(p_0\\\\) cannot be unequivocally identified from resultant flow lines, as the transformation could map multiple starting points to a similar trajectory.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
