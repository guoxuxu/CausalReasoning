  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( u(x, t) = e^{iwx - iwt} \\\\), a wave equation solution, where \\\\( w \\\\) is a constant. We analyze the effects of applying a differential operator \\\\( L = i \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\) to test causal relationships in transformations.\n\nIf, at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), we modify the system by applying a different operator \\\\( M = \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} - i\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x} \\\\), will the outcome at \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on the wave equation without considering the effects of \\\\( L \\\\) or \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( M \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) alters the wave form and dynamics established by \\\\( L \\\\), changing the system's evolution thereafter. This modification means the resulting state at time T is influenced by \\\\( M \\\\) as well as the original properties of the wave, and not just by the native wave equation evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of u(x, T) depends on the initial form of u(x, t) and the application of operators L or M. Applying L transforms u(x, t) but does not affect the dependency on M, and applying M also transforms u(x, t) independently."
