  "Problem": "Consider a function described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing an oscillatory system. We analyze the impact of the Fourier transform defined by the function \\\\( F(z) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{ z(t) \\\\} = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i \\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform output of the system at a certain endpoint, can we determine which transformations were used (whether \\\\( F(z) \\\\), \\\\( G(z) \\\\) or both), only by analyzing the Fourier coefficients?",
  "Explanation": "The frequency components in the Fourier transform cannot specify whether transformations such as \\\\( G(z) \\\\) were applied, particularly due to the integrative nature of the Fourier transform, which compresses all time-domain information into the frequency domain, losing specific historical details about transformative interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The time-domain function z(t) transforms into its Fourier representation F(z) through the Fourier transform, which then produces Fourier coefficients."
