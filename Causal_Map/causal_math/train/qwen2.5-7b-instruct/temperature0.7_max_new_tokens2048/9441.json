  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where we analyze the flow of a fluid in a channel influenced by a vector field \\\\( \\\\vec{v} = k(x,y,z) \\\\vec{u} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a scalar function of position and \\\\( \\\\vec{u} \\\\) is the original velocity field. The fluid properties are altered by a transformation, described by \\\\( g(\\\\vec{v}) = \\\\vec{v} + \\\\nabla h \\\\), where \\\\( h(x,y,z,t) \\\\) is a scalar field function of space and time.\n\nIf the vector field \\\\( \\\\vec{v} \\\\) is modified at time t = 0 by the transformation \\\\( g(\\\\vec{v}) \\\\), and then it is allowed to evolve according to the fluid dynamics without further intervention, will the fluid flow at time t = T follow the same path as it would if the vector field \\\\( \\\\vec{v} \\\\) was unaltered?",
  "Explanation": "The modification by \\\\( g(\\\\vec{v}) = \\\\vec{v} + \\\\nabla h \\\\) alters the initial conditions of the flow. This addition of the gradient of a scalar field effectively modifies the velocity field and, thus, the trajectory of the fluid flow, leading to different outcomes at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The scalar function k influences the vector field v, which is then transformed by g to become v'. The gradient of h (∇h) contributes to this transformation. The evolved vector field v' determines the fluid flow at time T, while the initial vector field v dictates the fluid flow at time 0."
