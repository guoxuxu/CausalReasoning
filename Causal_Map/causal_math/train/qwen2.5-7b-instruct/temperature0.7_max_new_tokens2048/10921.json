  "Problem": "Assume we have a system described by a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\) and A is a constant matrix. The influence of an integral transformation represented by \\\\( h(t) = (\\\\int_0^t e^{Bs} ds) x \\\\) over time t, where B is another constant matrix, is analyzed.\n\nIf \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\( x \\\\) was directly evolved under \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The use of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) alters the initial state by integrating the exponential matrix, which modifies the trajectory from the outset. This will result in a different \\\\( z(T) \\\\) that cannot be simply achieved by direct evolution using \\\\( e^{At} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the integral transformation h(t) to x at t=0 and then evolving it under z(t) = e^(At)x results in z(T) which is the same as directly evolving x under z(t) = e^(At)x from t=0 to T."
