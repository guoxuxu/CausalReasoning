  "Problem": "Imagine a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) evolving over time based on the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a complex constant. Consider the application of a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\), where \\\\( Q \\\\) is another complex constant, to investigate integral transformations and their effects.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) an intervention function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\) (where \\\\( R \\\\) is a complex constant) is applied, will the system's response at some later time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be influenced only by the matrix \\\\( P \\\\) and not by \\\\( Q \\\\) or \\\\( R \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) adds another layer of complexity to the system, making the final state at \\\\( T \\\\) dependent on \\\\( Q \\\\), \\\\( R \\\\), and \\\\( P \\\\). The interplay of these transformations can significantly alter the path and endpoint of the system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state of z at time t1 influences its state at time T. The evolution of z is governed by P but not directly by Q or R. Applying g(z) introduces an additional transformation that does not alter the fundamental influence of P on z."
