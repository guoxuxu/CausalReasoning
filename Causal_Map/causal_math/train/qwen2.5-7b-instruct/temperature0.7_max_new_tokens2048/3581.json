  "Problem": "Consider a system undergoing complex function transformations governed by \\\\( z(t) = f(z), \\\\) where \\\\( f(z) = ze^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) a constant. We analyze how integral transformations like the Laplace transform affect the trajectory over time.\n\nIf \\\\( z_0 \\\\) undergoes a transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and then evolves according to \\\\( z(t) = f(z) \\\\), will the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be equivalent to directly applying the Laplace transform to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then evolving it under the same transformation over time?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) alters the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by introducing a phase shift, and the Laplace transform of this trajectory differs from the transform of an unaltered \\\\( z_0 \\\\) due to phase accumulation and the exponential components in the transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z at time t, z(t), is determined by the initial value z_0 through the transformation f(z). The Laplace transform of z(t) is not equivalent to applying the Laplace transform to z_0 and then evolving it under the same transformation over time."
