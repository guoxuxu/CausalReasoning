  "Problem": "Consider a linear system characterized by the integral transformation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(s-t)} x(s) ds \\\\), with A being a constant square matrix. The input function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed using the function \\\\( g(t, x) = e^{Bt} x \\\\), where B is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( g(t, x) \\\\) is applied to the input function \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and the system is then allowed to evolve under the given integral transformation without further intervention, will \\\\( y(T) \\\\) at T be the same as if \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\) was directly used in the transformation to T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(t, x) \\\\) modifies the input function, thus changing the initial conditions of the transformation. The matrix exponential \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) potentially alters the nature of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) contributing to different results in the transformed output \\\\( y(T) \\\\) due to variation in integration with respect to the modified input.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "g(t, x_0) → x(t); x_0(t) → x(t); A → y(t); x(t) → y(t)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the transformation g(t, x_0) to the initial input x_0(t) at t=0 yields x(t), which then directly influences y(t) through the integral transformation defined by A. Therefore, y(T) resulting from x(t) is the same as y(T) resulting from x_0(t) directly, assuming no further intervention."
