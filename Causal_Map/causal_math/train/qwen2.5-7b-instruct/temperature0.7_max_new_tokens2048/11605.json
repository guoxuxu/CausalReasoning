  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary components of \\\\( z \\\\), respectively. The Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is used to analyze its frequency components.\n\nIf the initial condition of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is changed by adding a constant real number to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and then its Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) is taken, will the spectrum's magnitude at a specific frequency \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) remain unchanged?",
  "Explanation": "Adding a constant to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) introduces a DC shift, which affects the Fourier transform by altering the coefficient of the zero-frequency component. This change can influence the entire spectrum, including the specific value at \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\), by modifying the baseline level of the transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Adding a constant to x(t) at t=0 changes z(t), which in turn changes \\\\(\\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega)\\\\). Therefore, the magnitude of \\\\(\\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega)\\\\) at a specific frequency \\\\(\\\\omega_0\\\\) may change."
