  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit with an alternating current (AC) described by the complex function \\\\(I(t) = I_0 e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(I_0\\\\) is the initial current amplitude and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) the angular frequency. This system undergoes a transformation with a Laplace operator defined as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)dt\\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original current function \\\\(I(t)\\\\) accurately after observing its Laplace transform \\\\(I(s)\\\\) without knowing any alterations or time-evolution specifics?",
  "Explanation": "The invertibility of the Laplace transform allows for the unique determination of \\\\(I(t)\\\\) from \\\\(I(s)\\\\). This is because the Laplace transform of a linear time-invariant system's response uniquely determines its time-domain behavior under standard initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
