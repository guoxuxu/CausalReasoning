  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number, representing angular frequency. We examine the impact of the Laplace transform on this function and how it influences the causal structure of the resulting transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).\n\nIf an additional damping factor is introduced in the temporal domain leading to the modified function \\\\( z(t) = e^{-\\gamma t}e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) at t = 0, where \\\\( \\gamma \\\\) is a positive real number, would the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) in s-domain till only reflect the changes introduced by \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and ignore \\\\( \\gamma \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of the modified function, \\\\( \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-\\gamma t}e^{i\\omega t} e^{-st} dt \\\\), results in \\\\( \\frac{1}{s + \\gamma - i\\omega} \\\\), which includes changes introduced by both \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\gamma \\\\). Therefore, \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) reflects both the frequency and damping modifications.",
