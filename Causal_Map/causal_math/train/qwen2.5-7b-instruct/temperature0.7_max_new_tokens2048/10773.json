  "Problem": "A mechanical system's position as a function of time is determined by the integro-differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} + p(t) \\\\dot{x} + q(t)x = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s}x(s) \\\\, ds \\\\) where \\\\( p(t) \\\\) and \\\\( q(t) \\\\) are given functions. We analyze the impact of a control intervention defined by the function \\\\( h(x) = x + ct^2 \\\\) where c is a constant.\n\nIf the initial conditions \\\\( x(0) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{x}(0) \\\\) are set, and then the system is allowed to evolve under the given equation without further intervention, will the position \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if the system started with modified initial conditions via the function \\\\( h(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the function \\\\( h(x) \\\\) modifies the initial conditions, which would alter the trajectory of the system. Since the initial position is modified by a quadratic function of time, the subsequent dynamics determined by the integro-differential equation will diverge from those of the unaltered initial condition.",
