  "Problem": "Consider a complex analysis problem where the function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) is transformed using an integral along a contour \\\\( C \\\\). The contour \\\\( C \\\\) is specified to be the unit circle in the complex plane. Assume that the variable transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied to modify the path of integration.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to the contour \\\\( C \\\\) at the beginning and the function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is then integrated over the transformed contour without further intervention, will the value of the integral be the same as the original integral over \\\\( C \\\\) without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) changes the path of integration and possibly the orientation or number of times the contour encircles points of interest (e.g., poles of \\\\( g(z) \\\\)). In this specific case, the transformation will change how many times the contour encircles the origin, potentially altering residues and the value of the integral according to the residue theorem.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the transformation h(z) → Transformed Contour, which in turn affects the Integral Value, changes it from the Original Contour C to a new contour, thus potentially altering the Integral Value compared to the Original Integral Value of g(z) over C."
