  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform of a function, \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) = t^ne^{at} \\\\) with constants \\\\( n \\\\) and \\\\( a \\\\). Analysis investigates how operations on \\\\( F(s) \\\\) can deduce properties or behaviors of functions over time and under transformations.\n\nIf we observe a change in the value of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) at specific points, can we conclusively determine a change in \\\\( a \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Modifications to \\\\( F(s) \\\\) could result from alterations in either \\\\( a \\\\) or \\\\( n \\\\), or both. Without specific information about the change in function or form of \\\\( f(t) \\\\), determination of the type of modification is ambiguous.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
