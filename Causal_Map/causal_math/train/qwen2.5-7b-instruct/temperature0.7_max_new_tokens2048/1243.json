  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real-valued functions evolving over time according to the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), respectively. A transformation is applied to this system through the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant complex number.\n\nIf, at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention is applied through the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is another constant complex number), will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on A and B and not on C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces an additional complex exponential factor, affecting both the trajectory and the final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Therefore, the final state depends on the interplay of A, B, C, and D. Both initial and intervention transformations have significant impacts on the outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
