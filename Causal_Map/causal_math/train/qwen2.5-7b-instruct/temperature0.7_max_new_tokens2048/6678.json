  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolving over time according to the differential equation \\\\( dz/dt = Hz \\\\), where H is a Hermitian matrix. An intervention is applied to the system using a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{iKt}z \\\\), with K being a skew-Hermitian matrix.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we infer the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{iKt}z \\\\) can significantly alter the evolution path of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Without knowing the transformation's application, it's impossible to accurately trace backwards to determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) due to the phase shift introduced by the skew-Hermitian matrix K.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
