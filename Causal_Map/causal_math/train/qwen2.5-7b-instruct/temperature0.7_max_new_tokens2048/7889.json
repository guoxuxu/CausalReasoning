  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the system's response under an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t)\\\\, dt \\\\), applied over a time interval from 0 to T.\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is computed on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) which evolves from an initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\) for a duration T without any intervention, will the result of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) unequivocally reflect the influence of \\\\( k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) inherently includes contributions from both the homogeneous solution influenced by \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\) and the particular solution introduced by \\\\( k \\\\). Thus, \\\\( T(z) \\\\) captures and reflects the effect of \\\\( k \\\\) integrally across the interval, factoring in both the resonant and forced components.",
