  "Problem": "Consider a linear algebra framework analyzing the effect of matrix diagonalization on eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The system examines the matrix transformation \\\\( P^{-1}AP \\\\), where A is an initial matrix and P is the matrix formed by the eigenvectors of A.\n\nGiven the matrix D as \\\\( P^{-1}AP \\\\), can we determine the initial matrix A without knowing matrix P?",
  "Explanation": "Without the eigenvector matrix P, it is impossible to reconstruct the original matrix A from D, as A is obtained specifically through \\\\( PDP^{-1} \\\\). The lack of P leaves the relationship indeterminate, as any number of original matrices could correspond to the same transformed matrix D under different bases.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
