  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = e^{Ax} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant complex matrix. We explore the behavior of this function under the Laplace transform and its inverse, especially when analyzing causality both ways between input and output functions.\n\nCan we determine the point of intervention (introduction of matrix \\\\( B \\\\)) by analyzing changes in the inverse Laplace transform of \\\\( L\\\\{z'(x)\\\\} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Although changes in the system's behavior can be detected by examining the inverse Laplace transform of the output, precisely pinpointing the time and nature of the intervention (matrix \\\\( B \\\\)) is challenging without prior knowledge of the system's states before and after the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Introducing matrix B can change the derivative of z(x), and the inverse Laplace transform of the Laplace transform of z'(x) recovers z'(x)."
