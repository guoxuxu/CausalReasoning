  "Problem": "Analyze a continuous dynamical system represented by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a differential operator. We examine the effect of applying a Fourier transform to the system which transforms the original function \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) to \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,t)\\\\), followed by the application of an inverse transformation afterwards.\n\nGiven the evolved state \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\), can we determine the original state \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) perfectly without knowing if a Fourier transform was applied at any point?",
  "Explanation": "As long as the system's solution and transformation are deterministic and reversible, knowing the differential operator and its L-transform property, the original state can be uniquely recovered whether or not transformations were applied, provided there was no loss of information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying a Fourier transform to the function u(x,t) results in hat{u}(k,t), and if the inverse Fourier transform is applied to u(x,T), it can potentially recover u(x,0), assuming no loss of information during the transformation process."
