  "Problem": "Analyze the effect on signal transduction in a linear time-invariant (LTI) system characterized by a convolution operation with an impulse response function \\\\( h(t) \\\\). This study involves examining the introduction of a Fourier transform of the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) transformed by a function \\\\( F(w) \\\\) and its implications on the system's output, \\\\( y(t) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention is applied at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\) modifying the signal with another Fourier Transform \\\\( G(w) \\\\), will the resulting output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_0 \\\\) depend solely on the impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) of the LTI system, independent of \\\\( F(w) \\\\) and \\\\( G(w) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( G(w) \\\\) adds a new spectral modification to the input signal. The system's output depends on how these spectral characteristics, influenced by both \\\\( F(w) \\\\) and \\\\( G(w) \\\\), interact with the impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\), thereby affecting \\\\( y(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "x(t) → y(t); h(t) → y(t); F(w) → x(t); G(w) → x(t)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input signal x(t), which is influenced by F(w) and G(w), convolves with the impulse response h(t) to produce the output y(t). Interventions modifying G(w) after time t_0 will affect x(t) for t > t_0, which in turn affects y(t) for t > t_0."
