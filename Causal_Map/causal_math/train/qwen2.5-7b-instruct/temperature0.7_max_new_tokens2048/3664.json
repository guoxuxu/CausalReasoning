  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) applied to an initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\), within a system governed by the linear differential operator \\\\( L(z) = \\frac{d^2z}{dt^2} + \\omega^2 z \\\\). Analyze the impact of the integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\int e^{-i\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the state of the system at time T, can we determine exactly what interventions were applied (whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( I(z) \\\\), or both) based solely on the knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could arise from multiple combinations of transformations and interventions due to the integral and exponential operations affecting the system over time. These transformations can result in similar end states from different initial conditions and interventions, making identification from effect to cause infeasible without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The integral transformation T(z) and the linear differential operator L(z) both influence the state of the system at time T, z(T). The initial condition z_0 determines the evolution of z(t) over time."
