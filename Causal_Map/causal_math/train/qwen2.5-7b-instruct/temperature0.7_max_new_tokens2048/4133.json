  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(x, t) = e^{tx}i\\\\), where \\\\(x\\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\(t\\\\) is a real parameter, evolving over time according to the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = az\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf the complex function is applied to \\\\(x\\\\) at \\\\(t = 0\\\\) and then allowed to evolve under the given differential equation without further intervention, will \\\\(z(x, T)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\) be the same as if \\\\(x\\\\) was directly evolved under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = az\\\\) without applying \\\\(e^{tx}i\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "By applying \\\\(e^{tx}i\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\), the initial condition of \\\\(z(x, t)\\\\) is fundamentally altered to \\\\(z(x, 0) = e^{0x}i = i\\\\). The future state \\\\(z(x, T)\\\\) evolves from this modified initial condition, influenced by exponential growth driven by \\\\(a\\\\), thus resulting in a state that deviates from the natural evolution of \\\\(x\\\\) without initial transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Time t directly causes the value of z through its evolution described by the partial differential equation. The complex variable x and the complex constant a directly cause the form of the partial differential equation which in turn directly causes the change in z over time. "
