  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state. We explore the effects of a transformation given by \\\\( h(z) = e^{i \\theta}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\theta \\\\) is a constant phase shift.\n\nAfter observing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T, can we determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) unambiguously without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without confirmatory information about the intervention of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), deciphering the original phase of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) becomes challenging. The phase shift introduced by \\\\( h \\\\) could render multiple initial conditions plausible for the same observed outcome at T.",
