  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iAz + B \\\\cos(t)z \\\\), where A and B are constant real numbers. The study involves a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{-Ct}z \\\\) applied to \\\\( z \\\\), where C is also a constant real number.\n\nIf transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and the system then evolves under the given differential equation without further intervention, will the function \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was evolved directly under the differential equation to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{-Ct}z \\\\) modifies the initial conditions, thereby altering the trajectory of the system. The evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under the differential equation with an altered initial state never matches the evolution from the untransformed initial state due to the exponential factor involving C.",
