  "Problem": "Consider a mapping of functions where \\\\( g(u, x) \\\\) and \\\\( h(x, z) \\\\) are integral transforms with respective kernels \\\\( K_1 \\\\) and \\\\( K_2 \\\\. The system explores the influence of transformations \\\\( u(x) = \\\\int K_1(x, t) f(t) dt \\\\) and \\\\( z(x) = \\\\int K_2(x, s) u(s) ds \\\\), analysing dynamics between input \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and output \\\\( z(x) \\\\).\n\nCan we determine precisely what kernel was altered (whether \\\\( K_1 \\\\) or \\\\( K_2 \\\\) or both), merely by examining the outputs at \\\\( z(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\( z(x) \\\\) could result from various alterations in either \\\\( K_1 \\\\) or \\\\( K_2 \\\\), or both, and similar effects on \\\\( z(x) \\\\) might result from different configurations of these changes. The non-uniqueness of the reverse mapping process, especially with potential interventions, hinder precise determination of the altered kernels.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
