  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z \\\\), respectively. The evolution of this function over time is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a constant complex-valued matrix. Study the influence of a transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\), where \\\\( Q \\\\) is a complex matrix.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which interventions, \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both were utilized, just by analyzing the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both were applied prior to reaching \\\\( z(T) \\\\) relies significantly on the specific mathematical interactions between \\\\( P \\\\), \\\\( Q \\\\), and \\\\( R \\\\). The overlapping influences and potential equivalent trajectories arising from different initial conditions and transformations create ambiguities in deducing the correct sequence or type of interventions solely based on the endpoint.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of z(t) over time is influenced by P through the differential equation, Q through the transformation f(z), and also potentially by g(z). The final state z(T) depends on both P and Q, as well as any transformations applied like f(z) or g(z)."
