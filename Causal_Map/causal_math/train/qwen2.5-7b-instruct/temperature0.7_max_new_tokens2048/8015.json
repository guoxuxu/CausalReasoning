  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\(z(t) = e^{at} + i t^b\\\\), a and b are constants, and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. The Laplace transform, \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), acts on this complex function to analyze its behavior in a transformed domain.\n\nIf an intervention modifies the parameter \\\\(a\\\\) to \\\\(a'\\\\) at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), does the Laplace transform for times \\\\(t > t_1\\\\) solely depend on the new parameter value \\\\(a'\\\\) and not on the original \\\\(a\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The modification of \\\\(a\\\\) to \\\\(a'\\\\) changes the function from that point forward, but the overall Laplace transform for all times will reflect both the original segment influenced by \\\\(a\\\\) and the later segment influenced by \\\\(a'\\\\). The transform encodes information from both segments of the function's behavior.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The parameter a directly causes z(t) for t ≤ t1; the parameter a' directly causes z(t) for t > t1 and t1 directly influences z(t) for t > t1. Therefore, for t > t1, the Laplace transform depends solely on the new parameter value a' and not on the original a."
