  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 \\phi = 0 \\\\), in a region where the potential \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) is influenced by the boundary conditions. Investigate the effects of perturbing the boundary condition with an additional complex function \\\\( h(z) = e^{i \\omega z} \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the potential \\\\( \\\\phi(z, T) \\\\) at time T, can it be determined unequivocally which interventions (\\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were used by just knowing the final potential?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific interventions from the final potential \\\\( \\\\phi(z, T) \\\\) would require more information because different combinations of boundary conditions (transformations by \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\)) can generate similar potentials due to linear superposition, making it impossible to precisely backtrack the interventions.",
