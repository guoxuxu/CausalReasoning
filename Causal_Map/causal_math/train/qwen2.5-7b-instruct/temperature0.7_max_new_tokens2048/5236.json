  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} + k z = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the impact of a linear transformation given by matrix \\\\( M = \\\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\\\\\ c & d \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\) applied to the components \\\\( (x, y) \\\\) of \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( M \\\\), \\\\( N \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can potentially correspond to different combinations or sequences of transformations by \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) due to the complex nature of matrix interactions and the linear transformation effects. Thus, identifying specifics about interventions solely from the endpoint is not feasible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
