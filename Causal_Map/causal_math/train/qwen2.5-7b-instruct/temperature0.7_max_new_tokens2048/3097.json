  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i \\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant. We assess the impact of the transformation \\( g(z) = e^{\\alpha t}z \\) over time t, where \\( \\alpha \\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\( g(z) \\) is applied to an initial complex number \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\( \\dot{z} = i \\omega z \\) without further intervention, will \\( z(t) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( z_0 \\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\( \\dot{z} = i \\omega z \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( g(z) \\) modifies the initial condition by scaling it with \\( e^{\\alpha t} \\). This changes the trajectory of \\( z(t) \\) by adding the effect of \\( \\alpha \\), which introduces additional exponential growth or decay dependent on the real part of \\( \\alpha \\), and a rotational component depending on its imaginary part, thus affecting the final state at \\( T \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial value z(0) directly influences z(t) through the differential equation \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z. The transformation g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z modifies z(t) but does not change the underlying dynamics described by the differential equation. Therefore, applying g(z) to z_0 at t=0 and then evolving it under \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z yields the same result as directly evolving z_0 to t=T under the same differential equation."
