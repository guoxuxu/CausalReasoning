  "Problem": "Analyze a mathematical model where an integral transformation \\\\( T(f) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( f(t) = e^{At} \\\\) where A and s are scalars indicating the rate constants.\n\nIf observing only the value of \\\\( T(f)(s) \\\\), is it possible to recover the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without prior knowledge of whether the transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform \\\\( T \\\\) is unique, such that knowing \\\\( T(f)(s) \\\\) and the fact that it originated from an exponential allows us to uniquely reconstruct \\\\( f(t) = e^{At} \\\\), assuming knowledge of A.",
