  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real-valued functions of time t, governed by the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. Examining the impact of the transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{Ct}z\\\\), where C is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), a new function \\\\(g(z) = e^{Dt}z\\\\) (where D is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on A and B, neglecting the effects of C or D?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the intervention \\\\(g(z)\\\\) at \\\\(t_1\\\\) introduces a new factor that affects the final complex state \\\\(z(T)\\\\). The endpoint will thus depend not only on A and B, but also on how C and D have influenced the trajectory via their respective exponential matrix transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
