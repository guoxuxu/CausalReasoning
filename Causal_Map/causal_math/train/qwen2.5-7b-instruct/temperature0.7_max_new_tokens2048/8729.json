  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\\\\\((z) = ze^{zt}\\\\\\\\) applied to a complex number \\\\\\\\((z = x + yi\\\\\\\\), where \\\\\\\\((x\\\\\\\\) and \\\\\\\\((y\\\\\\\\) are constants and \\\\\\\\((t\\\\\\\\) represents time. The system's behavior is analyzed under an integral transformation \\\\\\\\((T\\\\\\\\), defined as \\\\\\\\((Tf(z) = \\\\int_0^1 f(zu) du\\\\\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\\\\\((T\\\\\\\\) is applied to \\\\\\\\((ze^{zt}\\\\\\\\) at the initial time \\\\\\\\((t = 0\\\\\\\\), then allowed to evolve without changes in function, will \\\\\\\\((Tf(z)\\\\\\\\) at t = T be the same as directly evolving \\\\\\\\((ze^{zt}\\\\\\\\) to t = T under \\\\\\\\((T\\\\\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\\\\\((T\\\\\\\\) changes the function's domain by integrating over a scaled version of the variable, thus initially modifying the trajectories differently than just scaling by \\\\\\\\((e^{zt}\\\\\\\\). Over time, the complexity of \\\\\\\\((ze^{zt}\\\\\\\\) against the linear transform of \\\\\\\\((T\\\\\\\\) produces different outcomes.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
