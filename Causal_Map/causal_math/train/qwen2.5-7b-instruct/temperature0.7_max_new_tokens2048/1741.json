  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state. Investigate the system's behavior under the influence of a Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), applied and then reversed on the function.\n\nIf the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) evolves over time without any transformation, would the function at time T, \\\\( z(T) = e^{i\\\\omega T}z_0 \\\\), be the same as if the Laplace transform and its inverse were applied during the interval?",
  "Explanation": "The direct evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any transformations results in \\\\( z(T) = e^{i\\\\omega T}z_0 \\\\). Applying the Laplace transform followed by its inverse essentially leaves the function unchanged, thus the outcome at time T remains \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega T}z_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial complex state z_0, through the evolution governed by the angular frequency ω over time T, directly causes the function value z(T). The application of the Laplace transform and its inverse does not alter this direct causal relationship."
