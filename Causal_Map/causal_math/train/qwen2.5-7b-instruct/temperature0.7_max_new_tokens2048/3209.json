  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by Laplace's equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) in a two-dimensional domain. A transformation involving a complex function \\\\(f(z) = Re(z^2)\\\\), where \\\\(z = x + yi\\\\), is applied, influencing the boundary conditions of the domain.\n\nIf \\\\(f(z)\\\\) is used to set initial boundary conditions for the domain at \\\\(t = 0\\\\), and then the system evolves according to Laplace's equation without further intervention, will the potential function \\\\(u(x, y, t)\\\\) at some later time \\\\(t = T\\\\) be the same as if the original, untransformed boundary conditions were used?",
  "Explanation": "The boundary transformation by \\\\(f(z)\\\\) modifies the initial potential distribution, which influences the solution to Laplace's equation throughout the domain. The resultant potential function \\\\(u\\\\) differs because Laplace's equation is sensitive to boundary conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the complex function f(z) influences the boundary conditions, which in turn affects the potential function u(x, y, t) at any given time, including t = T, under the evolution governed by Laplace's equation."
