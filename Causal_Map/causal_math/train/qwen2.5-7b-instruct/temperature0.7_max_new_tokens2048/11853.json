  "Problem": "Examine the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governing complex oscillations, defined by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. Analyzing the effect of a Laplace Transform applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and the potential recovery of original conditions.\n\nCan the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) be deduced uniquely from observing the inverse Laplace Transform of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) without prior knowledge of \\\\( k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) alone at \\\\( t = T \\\\) is not sufficient to unequivocally backtrack to \\\\( z_0 \\\\), especially without knowledge of \\\\( k \\\\), as \\\\( k \\\\) directly influences the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and consequently its Laplace Transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition z_0 directly influences z(T); the Laplace transform Z(s) inversely relates to z(T); the complex constant k directly influences the derivative dz/dt; the angular frequency ω also directly influences the derivative dz/dt."
