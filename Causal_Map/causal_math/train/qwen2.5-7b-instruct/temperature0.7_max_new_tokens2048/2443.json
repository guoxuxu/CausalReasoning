  "Problem": "Consider a stochastic process \\\\( X(t) \\\\) modeled by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{X} = AX + BU \\\\) where A and B are constant matrices and U is a control input. We study the impact of an integral transformation \\\\( T(X) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-Cs}X(s) ds \\\\), with C being a constant matrix, on the behavior of the process.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\) an intervention in the form of a sudden change in U is applied, does the output of \\\\\\( T(X) \\\\\\) at time T still reflect primarily the impact of matrices A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes U, which directly influences the dynamics dictated by \\\\( \\\\dot{X} = AX + BU \\\\). Even though A and B set the base conditions, the new U impacts these conditions from time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) onwards, creating a different trajectory that is further manipulated by the transformation with matrix C through integration. Hence, the final output of \\\\( T(X) \\\\) captures the combined effects of A, B, C, and the changed U.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An intervention in U directly influences X, which is then integrated over time to determine T(X). A and B continuously affect X, but a sudden change in U at time t1 will have a more immediate and significant effect on X before T, overshadowing the effects of A and B in the short term."
