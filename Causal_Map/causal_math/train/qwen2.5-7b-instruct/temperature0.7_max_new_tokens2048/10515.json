  "Problem": "Consider a signal transformation system governed by the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = F(s) \\\\). We investigate the effect of multiplying the original signal by an exponential function \\\\( f(t) = e^{at}g(t) \\\\), where \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is the original signal and \\\\( a \\\\) is a real number.\n\nIf an intervention occurs by filtering the signal with a transformation \\\\( h(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the new Laplace Transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\) of the resultant signal solely depend on \\\\( F(s) \\\\) rather than the original \\\\( G(s) \\\\) and \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the filter \\\\( h(t) \\\\) creates a convolution effect in time domain, corresponding to a multiplication in the s-domain. This alters the resultant Laplace Transform to depend on the convolutive integration between \\\\( e^{at}g(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\), making it influenced by \\\\( G(s) \\\\), \\\\( a \\\\), and the characteristics of \\\\( h(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace transform F(s) of the modified signal f(t) = e^(at)g(t) directly influences the Laplace transform H(s) of the filtered signal, with a → F(s) and f(t) → F(s) being the primary causal links."
