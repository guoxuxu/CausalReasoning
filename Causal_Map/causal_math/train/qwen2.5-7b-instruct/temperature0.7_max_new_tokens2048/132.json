  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a variable capacitor (C(t)) affecting the voltage output across a resistor (V_R). The capacitor can change over time based on a function \\\\( C(t) = C_0 e^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant. This adjustment in capacitance dynamically influences the charging rate of the capacitor and therefore the voltage drops observed in the circuit.\n\nGiven the final voltage observation \\\\( V_R(T) \\\\), can we determine the exact sequence and type of interventions (specific values of \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\), etc.) only by knowing the value of \\\\( V_R(T) \\\\) and initial conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The final observed voltage \\\\( V_R(T) \\\\) could result from different sequences or magnitudes of changes in both \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) (affecting capacitance) and \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\) (affecting resistance). Without additional information, these parameters cannot be unequivocally determined since multiple configurations could yield the same voltage outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
