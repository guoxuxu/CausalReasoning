  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(A+iB)t} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are real constants and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function is used to transform an initial condition in a spatial eigenfunction problem governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = -Au + iBu \\\\).\n\nCan we determine the original state of \\\\( u(0) \\\\) after observing \\\\( u(T) \\\\), without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Observing \\\\( u(T) \\\\) without knowing the details of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) or if it was applied complicates the recovery of \\\\( u(0) \\\\) because the transformations due to \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) alter the phase and amplitude in a way that is dependent on the specifics of the initial conditions and the duration of time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
