  "Problem": "Let's consider a system where the state is evolved using a linear time-invariant differential equation described by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a constant matrix. The study will explore the effects of applying a Fourier transformation defined by \\\\( F(x) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega t} x(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) on the signal \\\\(x(t)\\\\).\n\nIf a Laplace transform defined by \\\\( L(x) = \\\\int e^{-st}x(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) is applied as an intervention at a certain time t = s, will the final state \\\\( L(x)(T) \\\\) for T > s be governed only by the dynamics under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Laplace transform as an intervention introduces a transformation based on complex exponential decay which depends on the parameter s, resulting in a state that incorporates effects from both the Laplace and the original system dynamics. Thus, the final state is a product of both these transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of x with respect to time (D → \\\\(\\\\dot{x}\\\\)) directly influences the state of x over time (\\\\(\\\\dot{x} → x(t)\\\\)). Applying the Laplace transform at time t=s (s → L(x)(T)) changes the representation of x(t) to L(x)(T) but does not alter the underlying dynamics described by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), so the final state L(x)(T) for T > s is still governed by these dynamics."
