  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, described by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\), where A and B are real constant matrices. We explore the effect of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a complex constant matrix.\n\nAfter observing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, without knowledge about whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, is it possible to deduce accurately the original complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without definite knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), especially not knowing the specifics of the matrix C, the transformation could have altered the initial state in multiple ways, hence making it impossible to uniquely retrieve \\\\( z_0 \\\\) just from \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
