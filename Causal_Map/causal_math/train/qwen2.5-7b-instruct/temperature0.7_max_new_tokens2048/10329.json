  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a temperature distribution in a rod, modeled by the heat equation \\\\(u_t = k u_{xx}\\\\), where \\\\(u(t,x)\\\\) represents the temperature at position x and time t, and k is a constant diffusion coefficient. Consider a Fourier transform \\\\(F(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-iwx} u(x) dx\\\\) being applied as a transformation.\n\nIf a Fourier transform of the initial condition \\\\(u(0, x)\\\\) is computed, and the resulting function is evolved under the heat equation without any further transformations, will the spatial distribution of temperature \\\\(u(t,x)\\\\) at a later time t = T be the same as if the initial conditions were evolved directly under the heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying a Fourier transform to the initial conditions changes the representation of the system from spatial to frequency domain. Although the heat equation's dynamics can still govern, the inverse transformation required to return to the original spatial domain can lead to discrepancies, depending on how the frequency components evolve over time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial temperature distribution u(0, x) directly influences both its Fourier transform F(u) and the temperature distribution at a later time u(t, x). Evolving F(u) under the heat equation without further transformations results in the same temperature distribution u(t, x) as evolving u(0, x) directly."
