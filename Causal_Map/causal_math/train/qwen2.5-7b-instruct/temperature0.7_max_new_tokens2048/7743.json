  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = pz + q \\\\), where p and q are complex constants. We analyze the impact of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^k \\\\) (where k is a positive integer) and its influence on the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention via another function \\\\( h(z) = e^{cz} \\\\) (where c is a complex constant) is applied, will the behavior and endpoint of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on p and q, regardless of k and c?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces an additional modifying factor in the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) becomes dependent on the transformed states through k and the new exponential dynamics added by c, thus it is influenced by all parameters: p, q, k, and c.",
