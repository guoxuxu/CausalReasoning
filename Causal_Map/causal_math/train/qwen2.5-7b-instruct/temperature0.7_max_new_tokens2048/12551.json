  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a second order linear partial differential equation \\\\( u_{tt} = c^2 \\\\Delta u \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant representing the speed of sound. We explore the influence of applying an initial displacement by a function \\\\( h(x) \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) denotes spatial coordinates.\n\nCan we unambiguously determine whether the additional displacement intervention \\\\( j(x) \\\\) was applied at some point before T given the knowledge of the displacement \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) and the original displacement \\\\( h(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The displacement at T, \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), can potentially be influenced by various combinations and magnitudes of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) and any intervention \\\\( j(x) \\\\), making it infeasible to uniquely determine whether and what interventions were applied based solely on \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\). The system could potentially evolve to similar states at T from different initial and intervention scenarios.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
