  "Problem": "Consider a system where the heat distribution \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) in a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), with \\\\( k \\\\) being the thermal diffusivity constant. We explore how the Fourier transformation \\\\( F(u) \\\\) at time \\\\( t \\\\) and its modification by a function \\\\( g(x, t) = e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) is a constant, affect the system.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( F(u) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\), can we infer the exact initial configuration \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) without knowing the intermediate states?",
  "Explanation": "Given the linearity and reversibility of the Fourier transform and heat equation under ideal conditions (no loss or external input), it is theoretically feasible to compute the inverse Fourier transform and use it with the fundamental solution of the heat equation to deduce \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) precisely.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The temperature change over time (u_t) directly causes spatial temperature variation (u_xx). The Fourier transform (F(u)) is modified by the function (g(x, t)), which itself depends on time (t). The initial configuration (u(x, 0)) directly influences the Fourier transform (F(u))."
