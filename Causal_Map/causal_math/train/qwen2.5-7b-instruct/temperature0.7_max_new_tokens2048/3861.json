  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = u(x, y) \\\\) where \\\\( u(x, y) = e^{x^2 + y^2} \\\\. Analysis involves exploring Fourier transform of \\\\( u \\\\), denoted as \\\\( U(f_x, f_y) \\), and how the frequency-domain behavior changes under specific transformations.\n\nIf the origin is shifted by vector \\\\( v = (a, b) \\\\) in the spatial domain to produce a function \\\\( w(x, y) = u(x - a, y - b) \\\\), then performed Fourier transform on \\\\( w \\\\), will \\\\( W(f_x, f_y) \\\\) be a simple shifted version of \\\\( U(f_x, f_y) \\\\) in frequency domain?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of a shifted function results in a phase shift of the transformed function in the frequency domain. Mathematically, this manifests as \\\\( W(f_x, f_y) = U(f_x, f_y) e^{-j2\\\\pi(f_x a + f_y b)} \\\\), indicating a phase-shifted version.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Shifting the origin by vector v in the spatial domain transforms the function u to w, which when Fourier transformed results in W being a shifted version of U in the frequency domain."
