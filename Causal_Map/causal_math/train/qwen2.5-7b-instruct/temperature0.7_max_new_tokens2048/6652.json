  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature dynamics in a reactor is controlled by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{T} = k(T_e - T) + S\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a rate constant, \\\\(T_e\\\\) is the external temperature, \\\\(T\\\\) is the reactor temperature, and \\\\(S\\\\) is a source term due to a reaction. The transformation \\\\(f(T) = T^2\\\\) is considered at a time instant to study the impact on the reactor's thermal behavior.\n\nKnowing the final temperature at \\\\(T(T)\\\\), can one distinguish whether \\\\(f(T)\\\\), \\\\(g(T)\\\\), or both transformations were applied at different times?",
  "Explanation": "The end temperature at any point can result from several potential combinations of initial conditions and interventions due to the underlying equation's nonlinear nature. The identical endpoints could result from different transformations (squaring, exponential, or none) combined variably with the system dynamics, making it infeasible to ascertain the nature of interventions solely based on the final temperature outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
